Well, everyone got up and going this morning.  It's still raining, but that's okay with me.  Sort of suits my mood.  I could easily have stayed home in bed with my book and the cats.  This has been a lot of rain though!  People have wet basements, there are lakes where there should be golf courses and fields, everything is green, green, green.  But, it is supposed to be 26 degrees by Friday, so we'll be dealing with mosquitos next week.  I heard Winnipeg described as an "Old Testament" city on  urlLink CBC Radio One  last week and it sort of rings true.  Floods, infestations, etc., etc..My four-year old never stops talking.  She'll say "Mom?" and when I say "Yes?", she'll say "Ummm.... ummm... oh yeah.  Where do lady bugs hide in the rain?"  Anything to hear her own voice. Very, very exhausting.    Now I remember!  This is why I go to work!   *Sigh*Actually it's not raining yet, but I bought 15 tickets to the  urlLink Goldeyes  game for my Mom's birthday tonight, and it is supposed to rain.  Do they cancel baseball games because of rain?  Although the ballpark is beautiful, it ain't the  urlLink SkyDome .  We used to go to the Jays games occassionally when we lived in Toronto and really like taking the kids to the Goldeyes games now.  I don't know what  urlLink Blue Jays  tickets cost now, but I'm sure it's cheaper here in Winnipeg.  Oh, I just checked and it  definitely  is!Ha! Just set up my RSS feed - that is so easy!  Why doesn't everyone do it?  Enough for today.  The sun is shining and I should be outside planting my poor flowers (that have spent far too long in their pots) but I have 3 kindergartners and a preschooler who are refusing to go outside.  Little gameboy junkies...  I should talk!  Last post today, I promise.Oh, which just reminded me, we were talking about canning food at coffee break this morning.  Is this becoming a lost art?  Are there any people under 40 who know how to do this?  Those of us at coffee that fall in that age range couldn't.  What would happen if the world as we know it ceased to exist (a la  urlLink Day After Tomorrow  which is only being released today and I can't wait to see - I love a good escapist picture with lots of special effects) and we had to preserve our food somehow?  Well, we in Canada definitely would need to preserve our food.  I found lots of sites on canning, including  urlLink this one , but I guess that wouldn't help me much if everything went. Better print it out and keep it just in case!I've tried starting blog after blog and it just never feels right.  Then I read today that it feels strange to most people, but the more you do it the better it gets (hmm, sounds suspiciously like something else!) so I decided to give it another try.    My husband bought me a notepad at  urlLink McNally  (the best bookstore in Western Canada) with that title and a picture of a 50s housewife grinning desperately.  Each page has something funny like "New curtains!  Hurrah!".  For some reason it struck me as absolutely hilarious and has stuck in my head ever since.  What were those women thinking?My 20th high school  urlLink reunion  is this weekend.  There are over 100 people coming, so it should be a good time.  Lots of names from the past.  Funny, I barely ever run into anyone, and yet a lot are still in the city.We always have pizza on Friday nights.  It takes the stress out of "what am I going to make for dinner" and the kids look forward to it.  In fact, many of their friends look forward to it too!  But tonight we are having a family gathering at my mom's and I've offered to make pizza for all the kids.  So I've been madly making dough in my breadmaker (which is very easy but still needs to be done) and freezing it.  Now I have to go home and cut vegetables for the vegetarian cousins' pizzas and grate a huge amount of cheese.  Then I'll have to cart it all over to my mom's without wrecking the crusts.   It is not the usual relaxing Friday night, but this hasn't been a relaxed week at all.Okay, I saw it this past weekend.  Not as good as Independence Day for sure.  Better than Raising Helen which I also saw.  Yes, two movies in one weekend!  One was with book club, and one was with my husband since we hadn't been out together forever.  Guess which was with whom...I've been cataloguing film scripts at work.  What fun!  I have to look a lot of the writers up on the  urlLink IMDB .  What a great database!  I read somewhere that there were lots of mistakes in there, but given the absolutely huge amount of information, it is bound to happen.  And everything links!  I love it.  Library catalogues should be so good.    Best of all is getting a little sneak peek into people's lives.  Just enough to get your imagination going...Paul Martin promised today that if he is elected he will create 250,000 new affordable child care spaces.  I think they promised something like that last time around too.  But if they really want to do something for working women, they should make it easier for women to work and be with their families.  An affordable child care space would be helpful, but I want to spend more time with my children, so I need more flexible working arrangements.  Instead of a year's maternity leave, what if they made it mandatory for employers to allow women five years of part-time work.  If we worked at least 50% they should have to hold our jobs for us.  I think that would appeal to a lot of moms.  And then there would be a lot of part-time child care spaces too, which are  impossible  to find right now.    Yes, I'm still pondering quitting my job.  It seems to me to be ineveitable now... just a question of when.No, I still haven't seen it, but apparently it is  urlLink not so good   unless  you are a librarian.  Ha!  I am!Well, it's over!  It was good to see so many people.  Most haven't changed much, but some have changed a great deal.  Funny how things that were important in high school no longer are.    Anyway, it is over and I'm glad.  I was very, very tired all week and am glad that I had 4 days off to snooze a bit.B-Logs: The Business Blogs Paradox    urlLink HindustanTimes.com  discusses the effects of technology and blogs in particular. According to the article, Blogs are 'a direct, one-to-many vehicle for communicating ideas'. What makes them disruptive in business application is that they allow businesses - which are after all human -- to communicate with a human 'real voice'. On the other hand,  urlLink Webpronews.com  discusses the idea of corporate newsletter publishing via blogs. I found the idea very pragmatic and futuristic. Way to go !!Bohemian Rhapsody : Is it??   I have just come back to my room from the  urlLink IIT  coffee shack. The place, where we have shared laughters and joys, sat for long hours over countless cups of coffee and maggi and chat sessions. Where we have shared our thoughts and fought over stupid topics discussing them passionately. I have just come back from that very place, but with thoughts and feelings so different from what it used to be.  Today the laughter has given way to a look of tension and frustration on everyone's face. "Its so frustrating. There is no job. I am applying everywhere. No vacancies." And then on the next table you hear, "I am planning to go abroad on a scholarship. The job scene is really bad and I don't think I will get a nice job. Going for higher studies is the only option left in front of me." And then a person comes who does have a job. Meeting him, I congratulate him. But he is too irritated with the job he got. The job is in a core engineering one, in a chemical MNC, but the pay is a punitive six thousand bucks; the only perk being free accomodation in some small village-town.  There are ruminations galore, about the uncertain futures. About the decisions made. About the hard work, before and during IIT years. And to end thus, with a degree in hand but no job to do justice to years of hardships and hardwork, and that too when you are the product of one of the best institutes in the country. It gets too disappointing.  I only wish those people, my dear friends, good luck !! May serendipity happen !!Entrepreneur Guidelines    urlLink EntreWorld  is a website for entrepreneurs. It is a resourceful site for budding start-ups, discussing various dos and donts and giving practical advise for all stages of a start-up life cycle.    urlLink Auren Hoffman 's recent article on Entrepreneurial Boards discusses the leadership engine for the evolutionary stages of a start-up.   "Boards of advisors are best for helping entrepreneurs build companies in the formative stage, whereas boards of directors lend a hand during times of crisis or change, writes a serial entrepreneur."  Read the full article  urlLink here .  A strong board of directors can make the difference between success and failure for a start-up company. And, an effective advisory board can help one recruit those directors. Specific examples, indicating the tasks a board can accomplish and the skills it can bring to them, make this article particularly enlightening. The  urlLink article  can be assumed to be a Business 101 course :)).   Further, here is a  urlLink business plan  guide.Business Profiles of Some Companies    urlLink Business Profiles Home Page  makes an informative reading. Biz/ed have created profiles for a range of business organisations. These are presented as sets of FAQs, grouped into themes.The companies profiled vary from McDonlad's to easyJet.   *How much does it cost to set up your own pizza delivery    franchise?  *What's the best way of promoting online gambling?  *How do the major supermarket retailers compete?  *Is it possible to run a professional football club as a private investment?  Answers to these questions and many more can be found on the  urlLink Site .Multiple Interviews for One Job: The present-day scenario.    urlLink csmonitor.com  published an article on the 12-step job interview. There was a time when the recruiter took 20 minutes to size you up and skim your résumé before leaping to his feet and barking, 'Kid, I like the cut of your jib. Welcome aboard!'. It makes an interesting reading.   But today, with employers comfortably ensconced in the labor-market driver's seat, hiring decisions based on instinct are practically unheard of. Indeed, it's not at all unusual these days for a candidate to be grilled by six, eight, or even a dozen interviewers on various rungs of the corporate ladder as part of the overall screening process, say human-resources executives, headhunters, and other experts in modern hiring practices  "Many companies have made bad hires; now it's their market, and they're determined to find the people they want," explains Marie Raperto of the Cantor Concern, a New York City recruiting firm. "Even someone seeking a mid-level job has to be prepared to go through six or seven interviews," she adds. "It's endless."  "You can't even get nine people to agree on where to go for lunch," he adds. "How can you expect them to agree on a person?" But in an age where companies routinely boast about their teamwork ethos, nonhierarchical cultures, and commitment to "cross-functional" collaboration, it's easy to see why consensus now plays a major role in hiring. Many companies known for attracting top-flight talent say they believe that gathering a wide variety of perspectives is essential to ensuring that the right person gets the job.  Problems with group hiring arise when junior staffers or peers are given veto power in the final decision, says Bob Woodrum, a partner at executive-recruiting giant Korn/Ferry International. Recounting a recent incident in which a candidate was dismissed by a Fortune 100 client despite having favorably impressed 11 of 12 interviewers, he notes that "everyone has a different agenda," and that such agendas - whether personal or political - can conflict with the organization's best interests. "This was a case where 11 people had said, 'This guy's a hire.' But one person said the candidate wasn't enthusiastic enough, and that was it."

What they are selling is wadded up paper or something like that. The amusing part is the sarcastic way. Interesting are the dealings with the post office and banks. The site promises free shipment (though God only knows who would like to order wadded up paper). Its a laughing riot all the way. Check it out. The site title bears the name  urlLink Origami Boulder Company -- Original Origami Gifts! . Check out this excerpt from the site:  "Site is real. You order and you really get origami boulder artwork with special card to display at your home or workplace. Make good unforgettable gift for friends!  You buy wadded paper boulder and keep it. Or send many to your friends as very nice gift that no one ever forget! I include special card with every order that explain work of art. You buy 20, I send you free extra one with special message from me!  Hurry up and order now!  I send you wadded paper with Priority Mail. It is fast with nice free box from Post Office. Post office worker tell me, 'Don't take so many free boxes! You must order them online from USPS! Other customers mad when you take them all!' I laugh and yell, 'It says free, bureaucrat!! What you expect, dumb dumb?'  Update!!!! Wall Street Journal article on 5/29/02 say that Priority Mail is ripoff and doesn't arrive faster than First Class mail. This is outrage from post office lazy people. I complain today at post office and they laugh and pretend article isn't true. Who you believe, slow postman or Wall Street Journal? Now maybe I buy special boxes and send First Class instead of wasting money on Priority Mail. I make most efficient decision for customer benefit.  My friend is graphic designer for big company. She design page for me because FrontPage too hard for wadded paper artist!  I change design and she send email that says, "you've ruined my beautiful site!!! :O( what in the hell is up with origami boulder?!?!?!?!"  I tell her, "You designer, not site owner! I change whatever I like. You get paid, didn't you? Then go away now!!!" Her design have too many pages and Jakob Nielsen say Internet people too lazy to click so I make everything one page.Seth Godin   Came across the blog site  urlLink Seth's Blog . Seth writes in an iconoclastic manner, complete with tangential thoughts and lateral humor; thus living up to his strature of the ultimate entrepreneur of the year and a marketing guru. I think this blog is going to be added in my everyday-visits site list. Check it out. Its amazing. Herez an article from his site, that he posted:   Naming a business  Greg Harrington writes, "I’ve been thinking quite a bit about a topic lately—how to best name a business—and in looking for some ideas, I’ve reviewed several of your books, but don’t find anything in the way of a thorough treatment of this topic."  Here's what I think: First, the main point: a brand name is a peg that people use to hang all the attributes of your business. The LESS it has to do with your category, the better. If you call yourself International Postal Consultants, there's a lot less room to hang other attributes. Some names I like? Starbucks. Nike. Apple.  Second, please pick a real english word, or a string of them. Axelon and Altus are bad. Jet Blue, Ambient and Amazon are good.  Third, be sure it's easy to spell AND pronounce. Prius is a bad name. I can't tell anyone to buy a Prius because I'm embarrassed I'll say it wrong.  Fourth, don't obsess about getting a short web name. If you want to name your venture capital firm Nickel (a great name, imho) then you could have www.NickelVenture.com and that would be fine. The only way this turns into a problem is if the current owner of the URL is a competitor (which won't happen if you pick a non-obvious name, as I write in #1 above).  If you follow these pieces of advice, you'll discover that there are literally millions of names available to you (lemonpie, for example, is perfect for a scuba tour company. So are orangepie, melonpie and kiwipie). You will have far fewer trademark hassles. You will have no trouble coming up with a cool name that means nothing and makes it easy for you to hang a good brand upon. And you'll have fun.  BUT, don't forget to come up with a great tagline. "lemonpie, the easy way to learn scuba," for example.  PS a couple more tricks:  1. Use a stock photo CD and find cool pictures that match your name BEFORE you pick the name. If you can find a bunch of $30 images that work with a name, grab the pictures, then the name.  2. Don't listen to anyone else. All your friends will hate it. GOOD. They would have hated Starbucks too (you want to name your store after something from Moby Dick!??) If your friends like it, run.Schools of the Future    urlLink Ode  Magazine's latest issue sports an article written by the famous  Ben Okri  on the "Schools of future". He writes that in the future, centres of learning will teach at least one thing we do not teach today: the art of self-discovery. There is nothing more fundamental in education. We turn out students from our universities who know how to give answers, but not how to ask questions.   A really well written article. I hope we would analyse the shortcomings mentioned there, and strive to improve the educational models we currently have, imbibing new ideas and new paradigms into our present systems.IT Firms Slash Entry Level Salaries    urlLink Economic Times  reports that though most companies are moving towards performance-linked compensation packages or a variable pay model, industry estimates suggest that entry level salaries have been cut by 20-25% across major companies. Even as this happens, companies are rewarding top performers by increasing their pay. “While companies in the US selectively reduce salaries to fund the bonus pool, companies in India are also following suit,” said a CFO at a leading Indian software company.  Though it is not known whether a 20-25% cut in entry level salaries would be enough to fund bonus reserves and other allowances, sources in top rung companies state that since the measure will be across the board, it would lead to substantial benefits.  The market is looking forward to the first quarter results, beginning with MphasiS. Infosys is slated to announce its results the next day. “All eyes will be on Infosys, which has taken strong measures to further cut costs. These measures, which include cuts in entry level compensation, onsite rationalization of salary-related allowances and a focus to shift work offshore, would reflect in the coming quarters. But the cost-push pressures from offshore salary hikes could be more immediate, when seen together with a weakening dollar and rate declines,” an analyst at Credit Lyonnais Securities said in his report.

Its called Pattern Recognition. Again the timing of this book could not have been better. Pattern Recognition is about profiling a particular pattern of events or behavioral patterns. How does a person react to a particular situation, or as the latest fad is, how to gain an advertising profile of a person from the material he checks out online. That way he can be shown ads which would interest him.  Various sites are using Net Profiling and Pattern Recognition techniques to know what their website visitors are reading and seeing.  urlLink NYTimes  published an interesting article on Net Profiling. Here is a brief excerpt:   Visitors to The Wall Street Journal Online today will become the latest lab rats of online advertising, as the Web site starts grouping them into classes like "car buffs" and "consumer techies," all the better to serve them ads for Lexus or NetFlix wherever they may roam on the site  Sending ads based on interests usually requires users to register personal information with the individual Web sites. But the Journal Online is joining a growing group of online publishers in adopting technology that can classify users merely by monitoring where they click.  "It is not the way Web sites should be going because it's undermining the very nature of the Web," which offers instant gratification and usefulness, said Jakob Nielsen, a principal at the Nielsen Norman Group in Fremont, Calif., which researches user behavior online. With behavior-based ads, he said, "the challenge becomes, how good can we become at finding out what they want and need? If we do that, there's going to be no need for that disruptive full-screen advertising which says, `We don't care what you were doing, we're going to slam you with this thing.' " Visitors to various parts of the Journal Online will be placed in one of eight categories — car buffs, consumer techies, engaged investors, health enthusiasts, leisure-minded, mutual-fund aficionados, opinion leaders and travel seekers — or into a custom category designed at a marketer's request.  The Journal Online becomes the latest Web publisher to pursue behavior-based advertising. Tacoda Systems in New York provides its Audience Management System to clients like CondéNet, part of the Condé Nast division of Advance Publications; Tribune Interactive, a network of newspaper sites owned by the Tribune Company; and USAToday.com, the Web site for USA Today, owned by Gannett. AlmondNet in New York also offers similar services. And The New York Times on the Web, part of The New York Times Company, in March introduced its own version of behavior-based advertising, developed internally.Banking Blues   Internet Banking, ATM accessibility, M-Banking et al. The new age banking mantras. And the banks providing these services are not very old entrants into the banking domain. The customer satisfaction is their only driving USP. And so it happened one fine day. Realising that my old bank was charging me too much for the ATM transactions, and limiting the number of times I can withdraw money from ATM, I thought of opening another account with a "modern tech-savvy bank". It would provide me inter alia netbanking and infinite ATM transactions, the things I need the most right now.  I decided to approach  urlLink ICICI Bank , known for its operational efficiency. I filled the Savings Account Opening request form on their website and after two days also mailed them about my desire to open a bank account. After one week, I received a mail confirming the receipt of my mail to them. A promise to make an immediate follow-up on my mail was made. The email exchange continued for one whole month, with the ICICI representatives making false promises about sending some customer representative to my place to complete the formalities. It was very disappointing to get such a response from a bank, that was topping the best banks list in the country; and the same bank for which the customer satisfaction was the dominant criterion for survival.   After another one week (one and a half months in total), I called up their customer executive who promised me to send their representative right away. After another three days, a guy from the bank finally turned up to take my signatures and a photograph. And now its been full two weeks, since that happened and I have no idea about my account opening status. And that too with a bank, where "you can open an account instantly". Such goes their advertising campaigns.  I don't know if such lapse of efficiency is taking place in my case, or is it the general mode of operability of the bank. My other friends also quote few such incidents; though more complaints are about their ATM cards getting stuck in the bank installed machines.  All this just leaves me wondering, whether I should not mind paying those extra bucks to my old bank, and be sure of great service and hassle free transactions always. Is Old really Gold?Investments Galore   I have been reading and learning about investments of late. This came as a fairly new topic to me. Though I had heard about it since quite some time, but its only recently that I have started giving it some serious thought and made an effort to learn about what it is all about. All the nitty gritties of short term investments or LTI for that matter, they all form a part of the bigger whole, the Investment Portfolio and the kind of returns required.

You might not think you need to know something as deep as relativity to answer such a question. But Einstein needed to answer the question to invent his theory of relativity, the breakthrough that wrenched science into a new century and enshrined the equivalence of matter and energy.  In his last step, after a decade of pondering the mysteries of light and motion, Einstein concluded that there was no such thing as absolute time, envisioned by scientists since Newton, ticking uniformly through the cosmos. Rather there were only the times measured by individual clocks. To talk about times and measurements at different places, the clocks have to be synchronized, he said. And the way to do that is to flash light signals between them, correcting for the time it takes for the signal to travel from one clock to another.  A simple prescription. Yet when Einstein followed it, he found that clocks moving with respect to one another would not run at the same speed. The modern age was born.  As Dr. Galison relates, before the advent of factories began to standardize life, and railroad systems with crisscrossing tracks made it imperative to know which train was where and when, there were too many times, one for every village.  In the last part of the 19th century, the coordination of clocks and the standardization of time had engaged the passions of nations, business leaders, astronomers and philosophers. The patent office in Bern, Switzerland, where Einstein worked, was a clearinghouse for patents on the synchronization of clocks.  In New England, the Harvard and Yale observatories were competing to sell time signals to the public, and in Paris pneumatic tubes snaked under the streets to synchronize the city's clocks with blasts of air. Far from being a bit of abstraction by a loner genius, the clocks that Einstein used as examples in his papers were as familiar then as computers are today.  That is one of the messages of Dr. Galison's new book, "Einstein's Clocks, Poincaré's Maps: Empires of Time," due out in August from W. W. Norton. Part history, part science, part adventure, part biography, part meditation on the meaning of modernity, Dr. Galison's story takes readers from the patent office to lonely telegraphers sitting in the rain in the Andes, from the coal mines of France to town councils in New England as it circles around the exploits of Einstein and his rival, the French physicist, philosopher and mathematician Henri Poincaré.

New methods are continuously developed and old ones refined. A sniffer is one of the most offensive weapons in the hands of a hacker who wants to monitor a network. So much so, that Matrix-II (Matrix Reloaded) also shows Trinity working with a kind of a sniffer n scanning software Network Mapper (NMap) to hack into the systems. I read somewhere that Fydor, the creator of NMap, a fellow of the hacker/cracker brethren, was seen dancing in a cinema hall after seeing his designed and written software being featured in the movie and shown working successfully. Here is a small introduction about the Sniffers written by  urlLink Robert Graham .  A sniffer is a wire-tap devices that plugs into computer networks and eavesdrops on the network traffic. Like a telephone wiretap allows the police to listen in on other people's conversations, a "sniffing" program lets someone listen in on computer conversations.   However, computer conversations consist of apparently random binary data. Therefore, network wiretap programs also come with a feature known as "protocol analysis", which allow them to "decode" the computer traffic and make sense of it.   Sniffing also has one advantage over telephone wiretaps: many networks use "shared media". This means that you don't need to break into a wiring closet to install your wiretap, you can do it from almost any network connection to eavesdrop on your neighbors. This is called a "promiscuous mode" sniffer. However, this "shared" technology is moving quickly toward "switched" technology where this will no longer be possible, which means you will have to actually tap into the wire.

Fuelling the ongoing backlash against outsourcing technology jobs to India, the move has led to an outcry by the Seattle-based Washington Alliance of Technology Workers, which claims that at least 800 jobs will be lost to India. US media reports quote union sources who have gathered this information from current and former workers, claiming that hundreds of jobs will be lost.  Microsoft support centres, part of the company's product-support services division, in Sammamish, Los Colinas, Texas, and Charlotte (North Carolina) are likely to be most affected. Each of these three sites employs 800 people.   A Microsoft Corporation India spokesperson, while declining to comment on the number of US jobs that will now be outsourced, said, 'Microsoft has announced a pilot programme in Bangalore to support select professional products. Over the next few months, we will hire 100 support professionals in India as part of the pilot.'  Washington Alliance of Technology Workers president Marcus Courtney said the information (on moving jobs to India) completely contradicts Microsoft's public position that the impact of their focus on sending work abroad is not going to affect US employees. 'Clearly, Microsoft is starting to cut its US workforce and send work abroad to slash its labour costs.'Meetings et al  Found a really nice article on meetings at the workplace et al.

Aiyar's site  urlLink Swaminomics . He presents an idea of starting up an IIT each year in India. I think that will only lead to dilution of the present status the IITs hold as the pillars of excellence in education and research in the country. A rat race as mad as starting an IIT each year, would only lead to quantity without quality. And quality is what makes IITs stand out. The quality of teaching, students and professors. You can share your view with me :)). Here is a brief excerpt from the article:   "MANY institutions in India have gone downhill in the last fifty years. But the Indian Institutes of Technology are an exception. They are centres of excellence that are now recognised as world class. Their graduates are grabbed by multinationals the world over, and Silicon Valley teems with millionaires bred in the IITs. The infotech revolution which has suddenly made India a global player owes much to the IITs.  IIT alumni, many of whom have made fortunes in the USA, now want to do their bit for their country. Former students of IIT Bombay like Sudhakar Shenoy of the IMC Group plan to raise $ 150 million to upgrade facilities and faculty and lower fees in their alma mater. Kamal Rekhi, an infotech NRI who passionately wants to repay his debt to India, has talked of raising $ 900million to provide $ 150 million to each of the six IITs.  I am unable to join in the applause. The need of the hour is surely to expand the availability of IIT education, not to make a few ivory towers still more towering. Instead of making the existing IITs richer than ever, may I suggest that overseas Indians should set themselves a target of starting one new Indian Institute of Technology every year."

It was exhilirating and exciting to see the Indian government and government organizations coming out of a shell and fighting it out in International Markets. The story discussed here is the fillip to the oil security intiative being undertaken by India. OVL Videsh managed to pick up a substantial share in Sakhalin 1, the gas fields in eastern Russia, bordering Japan. And that too, when it was competing with international oil giants like BP. The story unfurls a host of channels being utilized, including economic diplomacy et al. This story makes an interesting thriller. Here is an excerpt:   WELCOME to the world of global oil deals — the most thrilling game in town. It is a game that the Americans, Russians and British, and, recently, the Chinese and the Malaysians, have been playing — and one which India has just joined in. It involves picking up stakes in — and ideally control of — each key new oil field around the globe that gets discovered. It is a playing field teeming with sharks — and the Indian players are still minnows. OVL has a turnover of a mere Rs 2,622 crore. The other Indian player, Oil India, is around the same size at Rs 2,000 crore. Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), however, has a turnover of Rs 119,848 crore ($25.5 billion), while Reliance Industries, India’s biggest private sector company and the only private sector player getting into the game, is all of Rs 60,000 crore ($12.8 billion). By comparison, the smallest of the global oil giants, TotalFinaElf, had a turnover of $94 billion (2002). The biggest, ExxonMobil, is a $191-billion giant with operations in 75 countries.  That’s not deterring the Indian players though. In the last four years, the Indian quartet has agreed to fork out nearly $3.3 billion (Rs 15,510 crore) between them to pick up interests in oilfields in 10 countries including Russia, Yemen, Sudan, Vietnam, Iraq and even the US.   The whole story is available online at the  urlLink Business World  site.Entering New Markets Internationally   Market entry decisions are among the most important strategic choices companies make. Entering any market requires a major commitment of financial and managerial resources, but foreign markets can be especially demanding.  The recent issue of the  urlLink SternBusiness  carries an article on a discussion of strategies for enterning new markets globally.  It says that the majority research on the internationalization process focuses on two factors as the primary determinants of foreign market entry: cultural similarity and economic attractiveness. Many researchers find that cultural similarity with respect to the domestic market is an important determinant of entry, while others have found that market entry decisions are positively related to country size and the levels of development, trade, and infrastructure.   Higher near-market economic knowledge is associated with higher probability of entry. By investing in a small country first and learning about the cultural and economic characteristics of its consumers and business institutions, a firm may be more successful when entering a larger country with similar characteristics.  The article explores the prevailing assumptions regarding the entry of an MNC into a new market, and then further goes on to analyse the most common product domains which have been a success in entering new markets. An interesting article, and the inferences drawn from the study henceforth.Direct from Dell   I have been doing a lot of reading of late. Right now, the books on my table are Tom Peter's "The Pursuit of WOW" and Michael Dell's "Direct from Dell". Both of them make an interesting reading. Tom Peter's, as usual, is a fantastic eye-opener. The guru mantras (I know it seems to have a spiritual bent but what the heck ...mantras are mantras ... and he calls himself the business-age guru)... as I was saying...the guru mantras are just amazing ... I notice those small things everyday but mostly didnt stop to look and analyse and derive meaningful thought process and conclusions from the day to day banal stuff. That is where Tom stands out.  Dell too made interesting reading. The way he ripped open his first computer just to see how it functions. And then his entrepreneurial drive right from the tender age of 12. The man ROCKS !!!urlLink How to revive investment   Swami talks about the investment scene in the country, which has failed to pick up despite the chronic efforts by various ministers. He proposes an alternate line of thought, a paradigm, which tends to "reduce the shareholding of the government below 51 per cent in public sector banks. Once this happens, officers in these banks will no longer be subject to vigilance (anti-corruption) inquiries when loans go bad. This single step, with all its limitation, can give a major push to investment and industrial growth."  He suggests that the best security for a bank is the "profitability" of the borrower. Yet, usually the lending rules adhered to by the bank ignore profitability and focus on sales, which should not be the  modus operandi .  Citing the last lines, "Some years ago, Yashwant Sinha introduced legislation to lower the government stake in public sector banks to 33 per cent, while retaining management control. Privatisation would be a more thorough reform. But even this half-baked reform has been opposed by the Congress, whose help is required to clear the Rajya Sabha. Dr Manmohan Singh, you must know that your party position on this matter is nonsense. Please end it. "Cancun Talks    urlLink Knowledge@Wharton  says that though the talks at Cancun failed to establish any concrete results, yet the emergence of the third world order in a unified stand is a reason enough to feel happy about. The article goes on to describe various political implications on the participating industrialised economies like US and Europe. It lauds the coalition on holding together as a single entity and not breaking up. The article is a good read.A public toilet with TV and newspapers!    urlLink Chalomumbai.com  reports that the luxury of television sets inside washrooms is not restricted to five-star hotels alone. A public pay-and-use toilet in  Govandi  is now offering residents a chance to watch their favourite programmes and also read the morning newspaper while waiting their turn to answer nature's call.   The toilet, managed by Nav Disha Samajit Shaikshanik Sanstha, caters to about 1,000 residents of Datta Nagar, Buddha Nagar, Gautam Nagar and Kamgar Vasahat. It is also frequented by taxi drivers and truckers.   As many as 250 families from the area are members of the public toilet and have monthly passes.  This seems like a really healthy change in the pathetic state of public restrooms. Reminds me of the Tom Peter's repeatedly stressed paradigms about public service and profitability from his book,  "In Search of Excellence" . A small effort leading to a customer (read consumer) centric endeavour is a sureshot winner any day.   More such projects should come up in nearly all the suburbs of the city. And its a sure way to improve the society and make money at the same time, which I am sure no one would mind given the benefits.  Shine on Mumbai :-).Your face can be your Password    urlLink The Economic Times  reports that there is a high-tech solution that could render obsolete your growing jumble of credit card PINs and computer passwords -- and it's as plain as the nose on your face or fingerprint.  The concept is based on biometrics -- a branch of technology that identifies individuals based on biological traits. Already, a host of firms including Minnesota-based Identix and Paris-based Schlumberger Smart Cards and Terminals built businesses on military and government contracts. But with costs of raw material, computer chips and scanners plummeting, the technology is moving to the high street.  The USP of this whole biometrics business is the price of the chip and doing away with remembering PIN ids et al. The chip unit costs in the past year are believed to have fallen from £40 ($66.79) to four pounds. This drop in price is expected to attract the interest of cost-conscious consumers and businesses, building the biometrics market into a $4 billion segment by 2007, up from $900 million in 2002, according to recent industry studies.  According to a recent study by Aberdeen Group, large organisations spend as much as $350 per employee annually on computer password management as employees invariably ring the IT "help" crew asking them to reset one of the myriad password codes needed to access the corporate computer network.   urlLink IIT Bombay  currently uses smart cards for login access at the institute computer centre.  Says a student, "As I can login with my smart card on a terminal, leave my work in a GUI running.... Just take out the smart card... go do whatever work I want to do and come back and insert the smart card back again in any comp having those smart card slots, and Voila!! my whole desktop magically reappears... I don't even need to put my password or go through any such login procedures..."   Personally, I find the concept of moving from any terminal to any otherterminal in CC, without having to go through the hassle of savingwork, logout, go to other comp, login, open the work again.  The utility of a single smart card is such an effort-saving process on the part of the customer or user who has to remember a lot of passwords or carry such stuff as smart cards. However, this new application obviates the need for even the smart cards, which till now proved a lot better than having to remember passwords.   So now, imagine a quick scan of your iris, fingerprint or entire face to authorise a credit card transaction, speed your way through customs at the airport or log you onto your computer.MIT's OpenCourseWare Project   MIT has come up with a very commendable effort; a worldwide applauded project, called the  urlLink OpenCourseWare Project .  MIT OCW is a publication of the MIT course materials, the best part of which is that the material is freely accessible and does not require any registration. Its a great effort to further the education process by opening up the courseware for the whole world to see. I hope that a lot of Indian universities take cue from this, learn from the method of instruction and teaching at MIT and improve their own educational modus operandi. I am just waiting to see when IIT comes up with the same idea, and I am so sure that the IIT course curriculum would be a toughie for the world to match up with.  Check out the site at  urlLink MIT OCW .Entrepreneurial Checklist   Most of the start-ups that are based on a product or a concept, start with much aplomb and energy. But as the business process unfolds, the myraid problems and hindrances, facing realistic everyday issues become too much of an unseen and unwanted stress for the entrepreneur. To give potential entrepreneurs an idea of the sort of questions they must face when entering business for themselves, the StartupJournal enlists a checklist. Its a very EXTENSIVE list, but interesting at the same time.   I am sure its going to be a handy reference for all the budding entrepreneurs out there. Shine on !!  The list can be accessed at  urlLink Startup Checklist .Speech Writing   "The higher you rise in the corporate ranks, the more you're expected to speak on public occasions, and the shorter the preparation time often is. The temptation is to wing it or, if you do prepare something, not to rehearse but to rely on your native ability and good luck to see you through. The sad truth is that when you wing it, the performance is rarely as good in the audience's memory as it is in the speaker's. The reason is that your heightened adrenaline literally makes you feel better--more energy, more enthusiasm, more acuity--and so you rate your own performance better."   urlLink HBS Working Knowledge  begins thus with the article from the book  Blank Page to First Draft in 15 Minutes: The Most Effective Shortcut to Preparing a Speech or Presentation , by Phillip Khan-Pami, a coach and competition-winning speaker himself.   Khan-Pami suggests beginning by identifying your core message:   When you have completed your presentation or speech, what will people remember? What will they take away with them, to apply and change their ways, and one day perhaps even thank you for? What one sentence will correctly sum up your entire presentation? That's your Core Message.   Make no mistake: Your listeners will take away a core message of sorts. They will carry away an impression of what you were saying. It may be complimentary, it may be less so. It may be about you and your delivery, or it may be about your content. If you want them to receive and carry away the right message—your Core Message—you must first identify what you believe it to be and write it down.  The article provides a number of formats to structure a speech:    PREP, which stands for Position—Reason—Example—Position: The idea is that you state your claim (which should sound a lot like your core message) and then give your reasons for it. Follow that with a compelling example, and close by restating your position.     Past—Present—Future, which takes the storyline of your idea and presents it in chronological form.     Problem—Cause—Solution. This structure works well for business arguments and situations. You state the problem—declining sales, say—and then analyze the cause. You follow the analysis with your recommendations for a solution.     AIDA, which stands for Attention—Interest—Desire—Action, works best when you're trying to persuade someone of something. First you grab their attention with a statistic or anecdote or claim that is sufficiently surprising to take your audience away from its concerns to yours. Then you raise the audience's interest by stating the benefits of the position you're advocating.     Tellx3, which, despite its trendy appearance, is actually the most conventional of structures. It stands for "Tell 'em what you're going to say, say it, tell ' em what you said."The Red Lobster Story   There are some good marketing lessons to be taken from the news about the Red Lobster executive who was fired for initiating an all-you-can-eat special.   Analysts say where Red Lobster, which is operated by Darden Restaurants Inc., went wrong wasn't in launching the promotion, but in depending on it too heavily. The trick in such situations is to make the rest of the menu -- or the rest of your product line -- appealing enough so the promotion draws people in, but persuades them to choose something else, not the special.   Red Lobster also thought it would cover the downside by charging a higher price for the special. But that just prompted people to eat even more.   In addition to all of this, the seafood market shifted and crab prices went up.   So don't get baked like Red Lobster. Be smart with your marketing ideas.

In research reported in the recent edition of the science journal Nature, the scientists said data from NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, which maps background radiation left over from the Big Bang, is not consistent with an infinite universe. The astronomical data suggests the universe is finite and made of curved pentagons joined together into a sphere.   Read the report at  urlLink CNN.com .Talking WindScreens can prevent Accidents.    urlLink BBC NEWS  reports that an idea is being promoted by Dr Charles Spence, from the University of Oxford, who carried out research using a state-of-the-art driving simulator. He claims that Hi-tech "talking windscreens" used in cars instead of mobile phones could reduce the risk of accidents.  The researcher claims that that the major contribution to an increased accident risk is the distraction of a driver's attention; rather than problems with physically handling a phone. He has carried out many tests, and the drivers found it easier to divide their attention between the eye and ear if the relevant sources of information came from the same direction.  So maybe, in the near future, the mobile phones would give way to talking windscreens. However, I feel one aspect of communication that the researcher did not address is privacy of the conversation with the windscreen via media. Does everyone get to listen in on the conversation or is there a one-to-one module for this medium of communication?Self Destruct E-Mail   News is on the web about Microsoft entering into a partnership with a San Fransisco based agency, which is a provider of corporate management systems, to help companies evaluate, implement and monitor email policies.  Disappearing Email for Microsoft Outlook is a plug-in that allows the corporate user to email messages and attachments that self-destruct at a time specified by the user or the user's corporate email policy.  Will be posting more on this, as and when I get to know more about this new plug in.Cell Phone company Thinks out of the Box    urlLink News.com  reports that in Manila, Philippines, Jessica Gazo has found a job as part of a new long-range sales team at the Philippine cellular operator Smart Communications and that too without sitting through a job interview or even submitting a resume.  Gazo, a 33-year-old housewife who lives 600 miles south of Manila in Davao City, is one of more than 100,000 mobile phone users who re-sell Smart's cellular services through a new prepaid service called Smart Buddy e-Load. With a special $20 chip for her mobile phone, Gazo can transfer bits of air time to her friends' and acquaintances' phones--as little as 55 cents (30 pesos) worth.   Since Smart began the program in May, Smart Buddy has exploded in popularity, giving the company a more inexpensive way of distributing service to the country's poorest, most remote neighborhoods and villages. The first such service of its kind, Smart Buddy marries the latest in cellular commerce with a much older marketing concept of  miniature packaging  that helped bring middle-class amenities to developing countries decades ago.   "It's a good idea in encouraging air time," said Karen Ang, regional telecommunications analyst at Citigroup Smith Barney in Singapore. "It widens the affordability of the product without Smart having to reduce prices."   While Smart said it was unaware of any similar services outside the Philippines, analysts say the concept behind Smart Buddy could help operators expand not only into rural areas of developing countries like   China   and   India  , but among lower-income segments of the population in developed countries like the United States, particularly among teenagers.  It is also hard to find anyone who actually talks on his or her phone. In a nation where the average annual income is less than $1,000, most Filipinos rely instead on cheaper text messaging. " Texting ," as it is known, has cult status in Philippines, and everyone from the poorest student to the loftiest government official uses it. Executives tap out messages during business meetings. When hot news or juicy rumors erupt, they spread like wildfire over the country's text networks, which have become a kind of handheld national chat room.   Offering cheap text helped Smart's largest rival, Globe Telecom, to become the largest cellular operator in the country. But Smart has gradually surpassed Globe, taking a 46 percent share of the cellular market, thanks in part to offering innovative new ways to capitalize on texting's popularity. In addition to financial information, news and celebrity gossip, some of the text messaging services Smart offers are uniquely Filipino. Safe Taxi, for instance, was developed in response to a rash of assaults by taxi drivers. When Smart's customers get in a cab, they can send a message to the company's network recording their taxi's license-plate number. If they do not send a message again within 30 minutes indicating they have arrived at their destination safely, the network sends a message to a friend or relative alerting them to a potential problem.  Smart will not say just how much air time is being bought over Smart Buddy, but analysts say more than a third of the companies' prepaid use is already being carried by the service. For Smart, that reduces the need to print and distribute prepaid cards for calls.   Best of all, Smart Buddy buyers can request such a card from re-sellers like Gazo by phone wherever they happen to be. Gazo says she has one customer who lives two hours away. Selling to distant customers means selling on credit, but Gazo said she did not mind.Nokia N-Gage Cracked    urlLink The Register  reports that the security system built into Nokia's N-Gage has been cracked, allowing other Symbian-based mobile handsets to play games designed for the Finnish handheld console-cum-phone.   So claims gaming web site Spong, without explaining how the crack works. But work it does. Siemens phone fan-site ClubSiemens has a series of pictures of the handset running the N-Gage title SonicN.   "The Ngage games runs very well on the SX1," the site reports. "[You] just need to transfer the game file to the MMC and use a specific application to install the game. There is no lag at all and the sound is nice, especially when using the stereo headset. Graphics are perfect, just have to remember to press the hash key to get the game in fullscreen."  This seems an interesting idea though stuff like this might lead to cracking and game piracy. I don't know where this will lead to with respect to Nokia and what measures the company might take to prevent such a thing from happening.Ruminations   I am reading a book,  777 Mathematical Conversation Starters  by John dePillis. Its an interesting book with lots of quotes, poems, laws and anecdotes et al.  Herez some of them, and further I will keep updating this page with what I like from the book.  Robert Lee Moore (1882-1974) coined the term "point-set topology". He is well known for his unique teaching method which, some would say, was less than minimalist. Learning by the student and teaching of the student was the responsibility of --the student. Moore's pupils were obliged to avoid textbooks and all other references in favor of "discovery". The result? After 64 years of teaching, Moore's 50 doctoral students include three preseidents of the AMS and five presidents of MAA.   Probability vs. Determinism :   Billiard balls ... are routinely invoked as the model of predictable physics. No one calls billiards a game of chance. All it requires to get the ball into the pockets is a well-measured poke of the perfectly positioned cue.  Dice on the other hand, [are perceived to be] the epitome of chance. Yet billiard balls and dice are both governed by the same physical laws.   So in the final analysis, chance lies in the clumsiness, the inexperience, or the naivete of the thrower-- or in the eye of the observer. In fact, one might perfectly imagine a civilization in which the rolling of the dice would be a sport and billiards a game of chance.   Problem Solving :  Professionals in all areas are expected by their clients to exhibit one quality they are supposed to have in common -- sound judgement. The following story provides an illustration:  In order to solve a persistent and intraceable probem with oneof its new multi-million dollar machines, a company contacted one of its recently retired engineers.  After studying the machine for a few hours, the engineer placed a small "x" in chalk on a particular component of the machine and proudly stated, " This is where your problem is. Replace this part." The part was replaced and the machine worked perfectly again. The company received a bill for $50,000 from the engineer for his service.  Feeling somewhat put upon, the company demanded an itemized accounting of the engineer's charges. The engineer's response read:   One Chalk mark $1.00. Knowing where to put it, $ 49,999.00.Parallel Universe   Wow!! Here is some fodder for thought, and I mean serious thought. I had heard the concept of a parallel universe and all that  urlLink string-theory  stuff which sounded very greek to me. But I happened to stumble on a website  urlLink BBC - Horizon - Parallel Universes  which details the concept of parallel universe. It says that the dimensions exist much beyond the most well known number 3. The scientists believe that there are 11 dimensions and the eleventh dimension is where all the hoopla takes place. It further goes on to say that we are in a tiny bubble which is a part of an infinite membranous bubble structure. And that gravity is just the pull exerted on us by the antimatter or the parallel universe near us.  Hmm, sounds scary but interesting at the same time. Seems like another fiction becoming reality as things get discovered and sorted out. Check out this  urlLink article  as well for more on parallel universe.

The ATM will be on the state-owned ferry and uses CDMA wireless technology to run the machine. Though the ATM is primarily intended to serve backwater regulars, it also hopes to catch the swelling wave of tourists pouring into the state. Seems like the banks are doing everything innovative they can to reach out to their customers.  Incidentally, the other ATM worthy of mention is also from SBI aboard the ship Queen Mary II which is the biggest cruise ship in the world. ICICI bank has started mobile van ATM services in Mumbai.  Way to go for the banks.Roulette, Millions in money and A Cellphone   An alleged high-tech roulette scam that saw three people walk out of a London casino with 1.3 Million Pounds recently sounds too implausible even for a movie plot.  Reports suggest that mobile phones fitted with laser scanners can be used to measure the speed of the roulette ball when it was released, in order to calculate where it was likely to fall. The whole calculation would need to have been completed in just a few seconds, as the dealer cuts off betting after the ball has rolled three times around the wheel.  But the trick could be pulled off a lot more simply if the phones were used as stop watches, says Norman Packard, a physicist at the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico, US. Just two equations - one for the ball and one for the wheel, which move in opposite directions - predict the likely area where the ball will stop. These equations comprise only a handful of parameters, including the mass and size of the ball, the shape and roughness of the track, and the tilt of the wheel.

The introduction to the interview is catchy itself. Check it out:  "I can't even begin to calculate how often people who are thinking about starting new businesses have asked me to name the one book that illuminates, more than any other, what it's essential to understand in order to create a successful start-up. For close to 20 years now, I've had to answer that there is no such animal. Don't get me wrong -- there are lots of perfectly acceptable books about almost every imaginable aspect of starting and running a new venture, from writing a business plan to raising capital. The limitation of such books is that, important though those tasks may be, you can get them right and still fall flat on your entrepreneurial face."Rent a Bike through Cell Phone    Call a Bike is a (relatively new) service from Deutsche Bahn (the German railway company) that’s available in Berlin, Frankfurt, and Munich. They leave bikes locked up around the city and when you want to rent one you just call the number affixed to the bike with your cellphone, enter your credit card number, and they give you a number that unlocks the bike. You can use the bike for as long as you like, at a cost of 6 cents per minute (euro cents, that is), up to a maximum of 15 euros per day. When you’re done with it you just lock up the bike at the nearest major crossing and get another code that you call in with to confirm that you’ve finished with your rental.

Do check it out..mobi domain and mobile phone servers    urlLink The Seattle Times  does an interview with Michael Wehrs, Director of Microsoft Mobile Computing division. He talks about some really interesting ideas which will change the way we use our cell phones. Talk about .mobi domain, using our cell phones as servers, smart phones ... the list goes on. Imagine a phone five years down the line that has half a gigabyte of storage, gigahertz processors, screen technologies and battery technologies that get you at that level of performance through an entire day of use, devices that simply work on whatever area network is out there, and they're smart enough to switch between them. All this is actually being researched and work is going on to make all this possible, and the usual rat race continues to out beat competition.  Some of the fiercest competitors in the business have already hashed out details of the domain project, including Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Nokia and Hewlett-Packard. The effort proposes to create mobile-specific Web sites that end in .mobi or .mbl though it still needs final approval.  Here is an excerpt from the  urlLink interview :   "We're looking at alternate user interfaces. Right now, everybody views a phone as a 12-button keypad and that's all you can really do with it. Some of the newer phones, (the Microsoft) Smartphone being an example, have softkeys which change their function based on what's on the menu. There is going to come a time when there's enough processing power on these devices to actually have a combined interface of input from a keypad but also some level of voice interaction, more than voice dialing.  If you create this new version of .com that will be the .mobi domain, you can do some very interesting things that mobile devices have unique capabilities of doing. Today, you can generally browse through a Web site on your phone but no one can access your phone as a Web server. If you have pictures stored on your device, the only way that you could share them with me is to actually send them to me as a message.    But wouldn't it be easier if from my Web browser I could just browse to your phone and look at them? In order to do those kinds of functions ... I need changes to the way the domain naming systems work. I need them to perform at levels that they currently don't have to perform at.  I think the things that you will see are significant changes in user interface. The idea that you have to pick up and dial a phone probably will be gone 10 years from now. The mode switching between doing a data thing or a voice thing, that will all be gone. You'll generally interact with your device via voice or via screen, but the idea that you're doing either/or will go away. It will just be integrated in.   The devices will become combined and in general much smaller. The idea of personal area networks where devices share their capabilities and leverage each other, 10 years from now that will all work so that you may have a watch that you talk to. You may have just a headset that that becomes your earpiece and microphone. The actual phone will be something in your pocket or in your PC that you have with you, so it'll find a radio network to use and let you connect."A9 from Amazon.com   Amazon.com launched its own search engine called  urlLink A9 , thus becoming the latest entrant in the domain dominated by Google, Yahoo and MSN.

New York University officials eventually discovered an  urlLink online journal  the student kept about his experiences and relocated him to a free dorm room eventually.  Stanzak, who dubbed himself "Bobst Boy" on the Web site, says he washed in the library's bathroom and took occasional showers at friends' apartments and dorm rooms.3 - Dimensional Searching - The Next Stage in the Internet Search Domain    urlLink Wired.com  discusses the new paradigms dealing with the next stage of evolution in the internet search domain. The mind-boggling speed and reach of Internet search engines mask a severe limitation: They are powered by words alone. But the world is full of objects and patterns. Now computing researchers have developed search engines that can mine catalogs of three-dimensional objects, like airplane parts or architectural features.   All the users have to do is sketch what they're thinking of, and the search engines can produce comparable objects.    "The idea of information and knowledge, and retrieval of knowledge, has been something I've been intrigued with for a long time. This gives it a more solidified meaning," said Karthik Ramani, a Purdue University professor who created a system that can find computer-designed industrial parts. Ramani expects his search engine will serve huge industrial companies whose engineers often waste time and energy designing a specialized part when someone else has already created, used or rejected something similar.   With the Purdue search engine, designers could sketch the part they need and instantly see dozens in inventory that might fit the bill. If an item seems close, but not quite right, designers can see a "skeleton" of the part and manipulate it on their computer screens -- make it longer or shorter or curved, for example -- and then query the database again.    So how can computer programs look for objects? The breakthrough is the  voxel . Digital camera owners are familiar with pixels -- the basic element of a digital image. Each pixel is a tiny grain of color. Similarly, a voxel is the basic element of a three-dimensional object that is represented in a computer. Each voxel represents the volume of the object at any given point.    In Ramani's program, for example, stored CAD designs and entries sketched by users are converted into voxels. Then voxel patterns are compared for similarities. Because the voxels represent volume rather than just shape, the program can sniff out, say, a coffee cup, which is mostly hollow but might have a solid handle.Microsoft Reaches out to Developers   Microsoft Corp. has recently come up with a new site called  urlLink Channel 9  that combines a host of social networking technologies in a move to improve communications with outside software developers. The site uses weblogs, mobile blogs, wikis and forums as well as other technologies to reach out to developers. The site was created by a group of five engineers and technology evangelists at Microsoft; it was named after the United Airlines in-flight audio channel that allows passengers to listen in on cockpit communications.  The welcome message on the site reads,"We think developers need their own Channel 9, a way to listen in to the cockpit at Microsoft, an opportunity to learn how we fly, a chance to get to know our pilots. Five of us in Redmond are crazy enough to think we just might learn something from getting to know each other."  Channel 9 seems to be all about creating a new level of communication between Microsoft and developers -- beyond the news groups, blogs and the press releases. Microsoft has been pursuing this initiative quietly, and has already been selecting and naming a select group of developers and users as MVPs -- or Microsoft Most Valuable Professionals. Over 2,500 people have been awarded MVP status till now.  BTW, for the uninitiated, Weblogs, or blogs, are personal-journal-type entries on a Web page, mobile blogs are Web pages with pictures taken using a camera phone, and wikis are user-editable Web pages.Google Phone   Just read about a new gadget being planned by Google. Its called Google "phone" - a branded consumer appliance that would make it possible to get Google search results and ads almost anywhere. Such a product would extend the company's search service far beyond the desktop computing market. The idea, like much of what the company is planning, is still secret.  Lets see how this idea shapes up for the company. Already, Google is hoping to cash in on the Gmail hype. The introduction of Google IPO is well timed, and is following the new bid-auction modus operandi. Well, there is still time to make final comments on the company, as the whole idea of net search and search engines is undergoing a complete metamorphosis right now. How Google fares in the longer run, is yet to be seen.The Perfect PDA recipe   PDA prices and the innovation in bringing out newer models has been falling rapidly with the rise of laptop markets and introduction of tablet PCs. However, some companies are still working hard to recapture the market share, that they have lost out to other digital devices.  urlLink Dana Blankenhorn  has a wishlist for a perfect PDA:   # A keyboard as big as I can make it. You can do that with infrared, so I can pound on any surface and still type.  # A real voice interface. If I can train it to my handwriting, which is abysmal, I should be able to train it to my voice.   # The ability to transcribe recorded notes.  # An integrated camera, so I can snap the picture, do the interview, and get both words-and-pictures for editing when I want them.  # Make that a video camera.   # Tighter integration with all kinds of PCs, especially laptops.  # Integrated cell phones standard.  # Cognitive radio that will automatically use 802.11 or cell systems, whatever it finds.    I put this in my pocket, I take my pictures and short videos, I do my interviews, it transcribes my notes, and I can then use an infrared keyboard to turn that into a package I can deliver through a blog.Gmail and Orkut   After receiving an invite through  urlLink Blogger  recently, I joined  urlLink Gmail , the email service from Google.   After I signed up and read some review sites, I got apprehensive and doubtful about whether Gmail was worth using. There were privacy issues and polices being critically discussed. And that was one of the biggest concerns. However, I was delighted to see Google react positively to such qualms and change its privacy policy to suit the concerns of the users. That simply proved Gmail to be more customer-centric rather than just being naive and dull 'another' email service.   The biggest draw is the storage space of 1 Gb that is being provided. I have exchanged around 150 mails through Gmail, and not deleted any one mail till now. The message display is fabulous, and has the display structure just like that of a message board. The reply box is right below the message, thus saving the users time and clicks. Another plus is the search function. You can search all your mail box by entering two or three keywords. I tried it using various combinations and found the search very accurate. A great email service indeed.   urlLink Orkut  is a new community centric site, where you can only join in if you are invited by someone who is already a member. A nice site, with a lot of possibility for business networking and meeting up with old friends. Though there are many sites based on this model, this site has been growing in popularity and user base. I think the main reason is the association of Google with it.  Also in the offing from Google is the "Google Groups". They will be on the same lines as  urlLink Yahoogroups  and the  urlLink MSN  groups. So finally, Google is taking its 'search-domain' competitors head on, by starting services which are the USP of its competitors.  The competition hots up for the internet companies, but that is good news for internet users, who get all the goodies for free. And a whole lot of choices too.Puzzle Site    urlLink Mathpuzzle.com  is a very interesting puzzle site. Check it out for some brainstorming sessions.QuickTopic    urlLink Quicktopic  is a very useful document review site, which allows others to comment on your work.   Imagine that you have authored a document and you would like your peers to review it. This site gives you an instant private space for gathering comments on any HTML document (Microsoft Word documents too). Your group can comment on each paragraph, directly within the document, and you can also display, sort, and print the comments separately. Comments are all in one central place.   This is true collaboration, much better than mailing documents around and having people make comments in isolation. And it's private, but still easy to access.Paradigms   Something really interesting that I picked up from  urlLink Seth's Blog . Seth Godin is a Marketing 'God' in his own league. He is the author of  urlLink Permission Marketing ,  urlLink Purple Cow  and the most popular  e -book on innovation,   urlLink Ideavirus  . He is an MBA from Stanford and a very renowned speaker.   "I just finished giving a talk to a group of 400 high-powered (high-leverage, high-paid) credit card execs. As I left the hotel, I passed a much smaller room, where a seminar for local CPAs was going on.  The snacks didn't seem as good. The booklets weren't that interesting either. apparently. But what occurred to me is that the folks in the second room were just as smart and just as talented as the execs in the first room.   The first group was enjoying the benefits of aiming high. They didn't get these jobs because they were arguably smarter or had better connections or had gone to Harvard. No, they were starting with the same raw materials as the group in the second room. The difference, i think, was that a long time ago, the people in the second room had made a decision about what they deserved, or what they were capable of, or what they were going to stick with. And it was a bad decision.  No, not everyone should be a banking executive. But no one who aspires to be a bank executive should sell themselves short because of a decision they made a long time ago. In a world where the past matters a lot less than it ever did before, where it's easier than it ever was to hit the reset button, it's sad to see someone choosing to be stuck. So, if you want to, switch.  Hey, the snacks are better."Canon Powershot A60          The old kid in fresh hands. Under trial :-).This  urlLink site  is steaming up the anti-India outsourcing propaganda by selling T-shirts like these.          Their site reads, "Help us to pressure Congress and our state governments to stop doing business with companies that outsource their jobs to offshore companies".   Further I came across  urlLink Blame India Watch , a site concerned with the increasing anti-Indian/anti-India sentiment among tech workers, as well as media coverage that focuses disproportionately on Indian workers or propagates anti-India(n) sentiment.   It looks as if the Outsourcing issues are hotting up once again, and this time on the net.Yahoo Mail - From 4 Mb to 100Mb    urlLink CNET  reports that the web portal Yahoo will begin offering ' virtually unlimited storage ' for its paid e-mail customers and will upgrade free users to 100MB.   This new upgrade plan is part of an overall enhancement for Yahoo Mail that will launch this summer. Besides additional storage, the service will get a face-lift and tie in more Yahoo-branded services, such as Photos and Messenger. Its being speculated, that after Google announced its email offer, Yahoo sent emails to Yahoo mail customers in hopes of gauging their interest in receiving 100 Mb storage.   The competition between Yahoo and Google continues to heighten. In February, Yahoo dropped Google as its algorithmic search provider and instead launched its own technology. The companies also compete over distribution deals, as evidenced in Yahoo replacing Google search on  urlLink CNN.com  this week.Webpage Auto Generator    urlLink StrangeBanana  is a program that creates a random webpage design. The page designs have, usually, never been seen before - they are created programmatically at random. Once you refresh the page, a new design appears. If you want, you can use the design for your own website (in that case you should save it immediately, because when you leave the page, you will never be able to get the same design again). An amusing concept, which ended up making me say, "Kewl" ;-).Enum    urlLink ENUM  is a protocol that is the result of work of the Internet Engineering Task Force's ( urlLink IETF 's) Telephone Number Mapping working group. The charter of this working group was to define a Domain Name System (DNS)-based architecture and protocols for mapping a telephone number to a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) which can be used to contact a resource associated with that number. ENUM was developed as a solution to the question of how network elements can find services on the Internet using only a telephone number, and how telephones, which have an input mechanism limited to twelve keys on a keypad, can be used to access Internet services. ENUM at its most basic is the convergence of PSTN and IP networks; it is the mapping of a telephone number from the public switched telephone network to Internet functionalities.  ENUM enables Internet-based users to make a selection from a range of services available for communicating with another person when the caller knows only a telephone number or has access only to a telephone keypad. ENUM allows users to access Internet-based services and resources from Internet-aware telephones, ordinary telephones connected to Internet gateways or proxy services, and other Internet-connected devices where input is limited to numeric digits. ENUM enables users to specify their preferences for receiving incoming communications, and gives greater user control over communications. For example, a user can specify a preference for voice mail messages over live calls during certain times of day, or may indicate a destination for call forwarding.   The potential applications of ENUM are far-reaching; however, the principal applications for ENUM have centered on two areas. One is Voice over IP (VoIP) and the other centers on Voice Protocol for Internet Mail (VPIM). The long-stated goal of the VoIP industry has been to make a phone call over the Internet as easy to make and as high-quality as a regular PSTN phone call. The goal of the VPIM industry has been to develop a comprehensive mechanism by which voice mail systems could exchange messages over IP networks. ENUM enables carrier and enterprise voice mail systems to find each other, interoperate, and exchange messages.   Although VoIP and VPIM are the most widely discussed applications, other application possibilities for ENUM, including but not limited to Internet Fax and Instant Messaging, exist.   ENUM has started user trial registrations. I have already got mine :-).C.R.U.D.E.    A Charlotte, NC, lawyer purchased a box of very rare and expensive cigars then insured them against fire among other things. Within a month having smoked his entire stock pile of these great cigars and without yet having made even his first premium payment on the policy, the lawyer filed a claim against the insurance company. In his claim, the lawyer stated the cigars were lost 'in a series of small fires.'   The insurance company refused to pay, citing the obvious reason: that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion. The lawyer sued... and won! In delivering the ruling the judge agreed with company that the claim was frivolous. The Judge stated nevertheless, that the lawyer held a policy from the company in which it had warranted that the cigars were insurable and also guaranteed that it would insure them against fire, without defining what is considered to be unacceptable fire, and was obligated to pay the claim. Rather than endure lengthy and costly appeal process, the insurance company accepted the ruling and paid $15,000 to the lawyer for his loss of the rare cigars lost in the 'fires'.   After the lawyer cashed the check, the insurance company had him arrested on 24 counts of ARSON!!!! With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous case being used against him, the lawyer was convicted of intentionally burning his insured property and was sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000 fine.   This is a true story and was the 1st place winner in the recent Criminal Lawyers Award Contest.MyLifeBits Project    urlLink MyLifeBits Project  is an initiative currently underway at Microsoft's Media Presence Research Group, and is directed by Gordon Bell, who was instrumental in creating the first commercial minicomputers in the 1960s.  According to  urlLink Microsoft  - MyLifeBits is a lifetime store of everything. When you are dead and gone maybe your descendants will be able to go thorough minute details of your life, your conversations, e-mail exchanges and the pictures and video highlights of your existence. That's the idea behind MyLifeBits, which aims to record the essence of a person's life on computer disks. Every photograph snapped, home movie filmed, Web page browsed, e-mail scribbled, phone call made or bill paid would be there in the storage space.  There are two main parts to MyLifeBits: an experiment in lifetime storage, and a software research effort. Both of them seem to be the most challenging. Because, firstly, searching this huge chunk of information would be a very task-intensive procedure. However, future technologies might make this possible. Secondly, documenting such a huge information base is a very tedious affair. Our lives maybe on the digital road but there is no way to organise all the pictures, e-mails and documents that form everything about our existence.  Still the project is being pursued with full enthusiasm. Cheers to Bell and his team.Digital Photography    urlLink Photoxels  is a nice site on digital photography. There are nice and detailed tutorials on digital photography terminology. Besides this, the site has one-pager format tutorials which give out various tips about taking pictures.  Though the digital camera reviews are not as informative and exhaustive as  urlLink Steve's  or  urlLink DCResource , but overall the site makes an interesting reading and is worth a visit.  My favourite forum site for digital photography is  urlLink DPreview . The site has categorized listings according to the camera models and brands. That makes searching a lot more easier than the usual single forum posting method. I like the ease of usability and the whole concept of the forum site.BlogLines    urlLink Bloglines  is a free service that makes it easy to keep up with your favorite blogs and newsfeeds. With Bloglines, you can subscribe to the RSS feeds of your favorite blogs, and Bloglines will monitor updates to those sites. You can read the latest entries easily within Bloglines.   I loved this site. Its a great service that has the advantage of not sucking up local resources, and more importantly, is outside my control in terms of news updates. I don't have to keep clicking the refresh button looking for another seed of info if I have control of my own aggregator, so it's much better to let someone do the refreshing for me. Seriously.Unlike other aggregators which require you to download and install software, Bloglines runs on their own servers and requires no installation. And since my Bloglines account is accessible through a web browser, I can access my account from any Internet-connected machine.  So no hopping over from one blog site to another now, when you can read all the feeds at one place. There is another option of sharing your feeds, so that people know what you read. Besides this, another good feature is the ability to send the feed as email; so the next time you read anything interesting, you can just click on email it and share it with your friends.  The site design needs a little fine tuning, as the three frame model seems primitive. Besides this, people are also advicing them about their revenue models. These issues are just timely, and will be taken care of as Bloglines grows. A great service indeed. Check it out!!SpyMac - Another 1 Gb Email Provider   Close on the heels of Gmail comes  urlLink Spymac , the web storage service from Spymac Network. Spymac is the largest Online Macintosh User Group and is developing under the belief that community is the Internet's most valuable resource.  It features an email account with 1GB of space with POP and IMAP access (so you can use it in Mail.app); 100MB of web space; 250MB of picture storage space; Public and private iCal hosting; A Personal Blog, Forum, and Picture Gallery; Customizable Content. And all this is   FREE  .  The question that pops up is, “How do they pay for that?” And sure enough, SpyMac has a section outlining that, right when you register. They are able to make the service free through revenue generated from their Auctions, their Shop, their Web Hosting service, and their Ads.  I have been reading articles and reviews on Spymac and they are not very great. Mostly, user complaints are about the slow email processing, chronic misconfiguration of spymac mail servers which end up causing some days' delay in receiving emails. Spymac is being used mainly as a POP mail account, but I think the picture gallery and blog space might thrive.  Overall, here is cheers to another email service that has opened up the storage space domain and providing the services for free. I think that the only point where they score over gmail specifically is that there is no keyword scanning and hence no advertisements. So the privacy issues are kept at bay and not tampered with.  Lets see how this finally shapes up. For the time being, go get your username before its taken.US CEOs Appeal for Outsourcing    urlLink HindustanTimes.com  reports that top American CEOs including Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer have petitioned the US Congress not to throw up barriers to outsourcing.  They have also sought a major revamp of the American education system, saying it lags behind that of India and China when it comes to technology courses.   Much to the delight of the executives, some Senators backed outsourcing despite it being a politically-sensitive issue in the run-up to the November elections. As Senator Bennett put it: “Let us not be carried away with the concept that trade hurts American jobs.”The Spirit of nation building  Every now and then the powers of the country throw up a new surprise, even to cynical beings like myself. But this one is a surprise of hope- Rangaswamy Elango of Tamil Nadu. A chemical engineer from Tamil Nadu, this villager Dalit boy decided to run.....back to his village and catalyze the development of a backward region as a Sarpanch. Although Rangaswamy is socialist in his approach (which, in the setup he works in, is a better beginning than none at all), one cannot help but admire the spirit of the man, who reawakens the spirit of nation service as existed in the days of the old.    urlLink Read on further...Yahoo Mail    urlLink Yahoo! Mail  finally became 100 Mb today. And unlimited email storage for its premium customers. The email service providers war is hotting up. Wondering if and when Microsoft follows suit and does the same for Hotmail.Need Gmail ??   I came across a very interesting site called  urlLink Gmail Swap  and could not help laughing. Endless are the things that people would do for a 1Gb account on Gmail. Anyways, this site is for all those, who have not got their gmail accounts. Here you can leave a request and some humble soul will send you an invite out of love or pure unadulterated altruism.  The site punchline says it all:  " gmail swap tells the people with gmail about the people without "1/03 DrKioni.com Awarded ByRegion.net Healers Best of Websites Award DrKioni Live Internet Radio can now heard on AuctionWitch.com.  2/03 Announcing strategic web partnership with AuctionWitch.com.  2/03 Site Popularity: Metaphysical Link Directory 1383 distinct links, MSN 143 Links,  Site Popularity: AllTheWeb 148 Links, Alexa 76 Links.

Although the dude did not pronounce her name correctly, she managed to shake the older dude's hand and then raised her arms to show victory to her parents sitting among the crowd! As you know, no other students would even dare to do that. The would only bow to the guests and that's it! Yes, my wife is always full of life and joy. It was the day that marked another beginning of her life: a professional life as an Urban Designer! I recalled the day when she first came to NUS when we were living at the HDB flat. It was a bit hard for her to adjust to life in Singapore as compared to Hawaii, but after we managed to  urlLink get a place for ourselves  her energy skyrocketed. It's amazing how much she has improved in her professionalism. ConGRADUATION to you, dear MicroWife!   PS: The commencement ceremony at NUS did not seem sacred. In fact, it looked very mechanical and different from most ceremonies. Rani's dad was annoyed when he heard Majulah Singapura only played halfway! He said, "It was a big day for students, why not just play it until it finished, rather than sampling it?"      Saturday    We took a bus trip to Melaka with  urlLink Hasry Delima Express Bus  from Lavender-Kallang intersection. It costs SGD11 one way per head, relatively cheap knowing that it will take us halfway between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. We arrived at 13:00 at the Melaka bus terminal and hired a taxi for RM10 to take us to  urlLink Baba House on Tun Tan Cheng Lock Street . Baba House is a historical shop house with 60 rooms inside a 200-year old structure. We managed to get one deluxe room for Rani's parents and one standard room for us lovebirds. I really have so much to say about Melaka so why don't you just  urlLink click here  or  urlLink here  to get a gist of it!    There will always be festival market going on Jalan Hang Jebat on Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. You could get putu, grilled dried sotong, sugar cane juice, at half the cost you would have to pay in Singapore (while the taste quality will be doubled on every food you eat here!).       Sunday    We woke up around 0800 and ate breakfast at the Baba House hotel, free breakfast if you danced Macarena just before you checked-in. After we checked-out, we took a river boat tour (private boat tour, that is, at RM 50 for one hour!). Oh, you gotta see it to believe it! The government of Melaka has done an excellent job revitalizing the riverfront as well as the preservation of the key landmarks. After boat tour, we hired a taxi to eat at  urlLink Bibik Neo , an original peranakan restaurant with an excellent array of "asam pedas". Make sure you come here and order the kangkong belacan as well as three orders to Kerapu Asam Pedas. It ended up only costing us less than RM9 per person for such a friendly service. Oh by the way, we asked the Indian taxi driver to eat with us but he was full already and sat down to watch us eat the delicacies while having a modest lime juice.   We then took Metrobus Ekspres bus to Kuala Lumpur, leaving at 1230 and arriving at Hentian Pudu around 1600 (the last 1/2 kilometer took us about 30 minutes to finish because the parking arrangement inside the basement was awkward, not allowing our 45 seater bus to zip in through quickly!). We then took a taxi for RM20 (what a rip off!) to get to KLCC where Danny and Sisca Tobing had been waiting for us the outdoor terrace of Dome cafe. For your information, Danny and Sisca just got married in May 2003 and now Sisca is 2 month pregnant. I have known Sisca for over 15 years - went to the same middle and high schools). Danny was a charter pilot who took over a business from his father dealing in marine and offshore drilling services. They both just moved to KL from Indonesia/Singapore and have loved every minute of it! Rani and I felt that they made an excellent choice of making a nice home in Ampang, on top a hill overlooking the Petronas tower from about 5 km away.I had lunch with Azlin in NUS Arts Canteen. As usual, I was having Japanese Salmon Teriyaki. I personally think that the Japanese Food Stall is the best in NUS! Azlin gave me a pack of  urlLink Aroma Coffee  that Henry brought from Bandung. This is a very unique coffee that is stored and aged for 8 years to eliminate the acidity and increase the robustness / body. Even now, Mr. Widya is still using firewood to roast the coffee for two hours to full perfection, without any additive or chemicals. We gave some sampler to our neighbours. Even Mike Willie who has espresso machine complimented this Coffee. I think Kopi Aroma is the best coffee in the world!  I also met with Prima after lunch and we ended up having some coffee with JW in Engineering Canteen.   Later in the evening, while Mas Indi was having dinner with Minister Jayakumar, Minister Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and the whole US-Asean guys in Shangri-La Hotel, I was struggling in CASA Lab in NUS trying to make ArcGIS Editing works without crashing. On the other corner Simon was playing WarCraft in his SGI Computer!To answer Fay's question:   "And Rani, your sudden craving for nJ ice cream kebetulan ke or because you baru baca pasal BnJ on my website? Hehe. Hope to see you guys next week. :)"   No, Fay, I did not tell Mas Indi about my desire for Ice Cream. In fact, I was expecting Movenpick! Somehow miracle does happen. After we chatted about BnJ, Mas Indi later came home bringing a pint of Cherry Garcia without me asking for it. And by now one pint has already run thin.  This morning, while Mas Indi was doing putting and driving in Raffles Country Club with the big bosses, I was having breakfast with my former boss (my present foster dad),  urlLink Mr. Jeremy Wagstaff  in Borders Bistro Orchard Road. He was bragging about his new Palm Tungsten with bright screen nice resolution and all wi-fi capability (which he could not manage to make it work in Borders Bistro). I also introduce myself to  urlLink Ms. Sari Sudarsono , a very kind petite young lady who works for LA Times Indonesia. I ended up buying books on learning chinese characters and chinese dictionary with hanyu pinyin.Yesterday night Mas Indi brought me one pint of  urlLink Ben and Jerry’s Ice Cream Cherry Garcia ! He just knows what and when to give pleasant surprise for me. I think Ben and Jerry’s have a bolder taste, a funkier type of ice cream, whereas  urlLink Movenpick ice cream  (my favorite is Maple Walnut) has a smoother taste, a classier type.   urlLink Indonesia is mentioned in Ben and Jerry's website . Is this an example of fair trade? Do the vanilla farmers in Indonesia receive appropriate reward?  This morning I accompanied Mas Indi practicing golf in  urlLink Temasek Club  driving range. Too bad he just realized now how comfortable it is to practice near our house. Now it is too late because the driving range is going to be demolished pretty soon to build a new road connecting Queensway to AYE, right in front of our estate.  After breakfast we went to Shangri-La hotel and met up with Fanny Bahar and David Hutagalung.  Askar and I continued to walk to Plaza Singapore to get Pizza for brunch. I have been longing for pizza for quite a long time. The Pizza at Pasta Mania has great cheese and seafood topping but I don’t like the crust. I think the crust is too crispy like crackers. I don’t like  urlLink Pizza Hut  crust either, because it is too bread like. I prefer the pizza crust in  urlLink Papa John’s ,  urlLink California Pizza Kitchen , or  urlLink Domino’s  which has rubbery crust and tasty.  We continued to walk to  urlLink Sonata Dance Supplies  where I inquired about the price of ballet equipment. I would need to spend at least $80 to buy those equipments. Then we went to Times bookshop where I bought “ urlLink Stupid White Men ” by Michael Moore and “ urlLink Why Do People Hate America ” by Sardar and Davies.  Then I went to Specialist Shopping Center to find out the cost for Adult Ballet class, which turned out to be cheaper then YMCA. I think I will enroll to this class in August. Having class once a week will be enough.  I went home after that and Askar followed to Hang Jebat to seek shelter from the rain. I ended up cooking chicken porridge for him.As mentioned right below, we want to accompany Karyn to fulfill her desire of Thai Food at  urlLink Lotus Thai Restaurant  which we consider the best Thai restaurant in Singapore. It is located in Tanjong Pagar Murray Terrace and has the authentic Thai taste and great spiciness. The Sea Food Tom Yam is to die for. We also recommend the Lemongrass Salad and Mango Salad. Chicken With Basil and Pad Thai are also our favorites. Don't forget to order Sweet Tapioca for dessert!Yesterday Uman showed me the website of his son,  urlLink Aidan Prasojo , who was born June 10th, 2003.  The name Aidan originated from Celtic word which means  the little fire that gives warmth to the family . Such a beautiful name! Indi and I will consider that name for our future son.   We have several other choices for names. For girls:  Lalita  (to be natural),  Lani  (Hawaiian -  the sky or heaven),  Aina  (Hawaiian - the earth or motherland),  Moana  (Hawaiian). For boys:  Kamma  (as in Kamma Sutra),  Neruda  (from the Poet in the movie Il Postino),  Keoni  (Hawaiian),  Vidhya  (Indian of Widya). Any suggestion for other names, please do not hesitate to post us some advice by  urlLink writing in our guestbook .  It is nice to know that we have such a great neighbour! I bumped into Karyn this morning (and Sacha the dog!) and she complimented my mutton tongseng curry! We will arrange a cookout sometime this week to cook mutton tongseng, spinach masala, and chapatti in my place. Karyn as a pregnant lady desires to go to Lotus Thai restaurant next week. I think Indi and I should take care of it.  I had lunch in NUS Engineering Canteen with  urlLink Simon Zhuang , Freddy, and  urlLink Antonio Ismael  who happened to be in Singapore all the way from Bali. Too bad JW couldn't join us. We had a great discussion on Architecture for the Poor. We hope we all can develop some kind of cooperation in the future for the sake of Indonesian urban poors. Now, I am going to cook Spinach Masala with Brown Rice for dinner. Mas Indi is working overtime tonight for  urlLink US-ASEAN Busines Council  Board Meeting and I want to surprise him with masala.Rani has been feeling very guilty for the past several days after watching Japan Hour on ChannelNews Asia: re: SUSHI. Last night in the quiet moment just before we fell asleep she suddenly woke up and said, "Doggone it! I should have dipped the fish topping first into the soy souce! Head first!". I was surprised by her attention to details especially in dealing with delicacies. PS: For those of you who'd seen her eat Sushi would know that she'll chow down on the fish first!Sorry, but I gotta..I couldn't remember the words and it was driving me insane...  Artist : Lisa Loeb  Song : I Do   When I'm done with thinking, then I'm done with you When I'm done with crying, then I'm done with you When I feel so tired, then I'm done with you Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way.  And I do. You can't hear it, but I do. You can't hear it, but I do.  You're trying to convince me, that what I've done's not right I get so frustrated, I stay up every night. You ask me for an answer, and I'm so tired and I'm up in the air (I'm up in the air) Everybody feels this way sometimes, everybody feels this way  And I do. You can't hear it but I do You can't hear it, but I'm feeling this way just because you say  I will be ignored I will be denied I could be erased I could be brushed aside I will get scared, and I will get shoved down but I feel like I do because you push me around.  I'm starting to ignore you, I doubted you so long, I'm tired of over-thinkin, I know you don't belong Now I'm asking questions, No one pushes me around, Everybody feels this ways sometimes, Everybody feels this way  And I do You can't hear it but I do You don't seem angry but I do I do.maybe I do like "dog"..The astute among you will note that this run is a minute shorter than the 5th one.  This run was three minutes running, one minute walking--which is much harder than the previous run-walk ratio.  I was feeling good until the 4th repetition, which was difficult, and I really struggled through the 5th one.  Tonight I noticed a very odd sensation.  While I was happy to take the little walking breaks, I found that the moment I started running again after each break my legs felt really invigorated.  I'm sure there's some clever scientific name for this phenomenon.  However, I'm also sure there's  no  clever scientific name for the fact that I'm really, really glad tonight's run is over.So the pressing question was whether I should increase my total running time or decrease my walking time.  Since the schedule I'm following says to increase running time, I decided to do that.  They're the experts, after all--I'm just the one in the expensive shoes.  While today didn't exactly feel what I would call "good," it didn't feel bad either.  Actually, after my third repetition I felt like a million bucks; after my fourth, I flagged a bit.  But I made it through to my 7th repetition without feeling like my lungs were inside out.  I probably could have done 8 repetitions, if the truth be told, but I'm sure I'll regret saying that on Wednesday.  Jon has just decided to go on a health kick too; he says that he's going to join me in running.  I think I might be a little bit too slow for him.  Today I definitely felt like a jogger rather than a runner--I think it has to do with the massive amount of crap (chocolate syrup, ice cream, crisps, pizza, etc.) I've been eating over the past couple of days.I can assure you that it was not laughably easy.  It wasn't as hard as last time, but it still felt pretty painful.  I didn't start thinking I was going. to. die. until the 4th repetition, at which point I again told myself that I was only going to do 5 repetitions.  I even had all sorts of excuses figured out: I was running at midday in the sun; I was running in the park on uneven ground, I was feeling vaguely hung-over.  But in the end it was the thought of coming here and writing down the fact that I had wussed out that made me do the 6th repetition.  Now I have the reward of a hot bath.Tonight I decided to decrease the walking time between the periods of running.  I did 2 minutes on, one minute off, repeated 6 times.  After the first 2 repetitions, I felt like I was going. to. die.  But the middle two were fine; I was on top of the world.  I considered only doing 5 repetitions, but when I finished the 5th, I was further away from my house than I expected, so I slogged on to a 6th.  The 6th repetition was a real struggle.  I was literally forcing myself to put one foot in front of the other.  The knowledge of a hot bath was the only thing that kept me going.  Then I had to run past my house to finish out the time.  Psychologically, I found that upsetting.  I also find the people on the sidewalks upsetting.  I have this paranoid fantasy that all people who see me running are runners themselves, and they're critiquing me.  When I'm feeling slow and down, I find that forcing myself into a sprint helps me get past it.  Even though I'm not a fast runner by any means, I prefer to run at speed rather than to jog.  I'm not sure if this was a struggle because I didn't run for over a week, or if it was because it was genuinely more difficult than my last run.  Anyway, I'm sure I'll laugh at myself on Saturday when I go out and do the same run again and I find it laughably easy.I spent a long weekend in Edinburgh, doing more walking around than usual, but not doing any running.  In the meantime, however, my knee felt fantastic.  After the ACL surgery I lost most of my muscle tone, which meant that my kneecap wasn't tracking properly, which led to some clicking and aching when walking, especially when walking down steps.  Now, after only two runs, I can feel a real difference in the way my knee feels when going down stairs.  It's almost normal, which is something I don't take for granted.Tonight I did the 2 minutes running, 2 minutes walking deal (repeated 4 times), which is the recommended first run for 10 training according to the schedule I've decided to use.  I have to admit that it was far too easy.  I came in the house having not even broken a sweat.  Because it was so easy, I'm not sure whether to increase the overall time out or decrease the in-between walking times.  There seem to be definite advantages and disadvantages to both.My initial plan was to start on a basic 10k training schedule,  urlLink as described here .  However, tonight--my first night out--was still a little bit of a tester, so I ran for 1 minute, walked for 1 minute, and repeated that 6 times.  It was reasonably hard work, but it wasn't anything scary, and my knee felt fine.  I feel that I am ready to move onto the proper 10k training schedule.Whoever reads this (if there is anyone) might think I'm not taking this running thing very seriously.  I am, believe me, but you have to understand that the past few weeks and the next few weeks are full up.  There are plenty of nights where I get 5 hours of sleep because I'm busy doing things I must do (and there's precious little reading or watching TV going on), then the next day I'm shattered because I only got 5 hours of sleep.  Fitting in half an hour of running, while technically feasible, is not always an incredibly attractive option.  Cycling, however, is a happy medium.  But I have been afraid to cycle recently for two reasons:  1) Last October, running + cycling really made my knee hurt.  Running was ok, but cycling actually caused my knee to react so badly that I couldn't run anymore.  2) My chain is rusty.  I've been running (if you can call it that) for a few weeks with no bad reaction from my knee at all, so I thought tonight I would give cycling a go.  On closer inspection my chain wasn't too bad (though I probably should replace it), so I braved it.  Because I haven't cycled in a while and I was worried that either my knee or my chain would break, I didn't go too far afield, and only did half an hour.  It's not particularly hard work for me, even on the hardest gears, and it's an excellent opportunity to make my left leg work harder (because I would estimate that my left leg is only about 80% as strong as my right leg now).  We shall see how my knee reacts, but I'll probably be cycling more if it's ok.I'm amazed that, even being so lazy as to go out only once a week for the past couple of weeks, I've managed to improve each week.  Today I ran for 7 minutes, walked for 2, ran for 4, walked for 2, and ran for 7.  That's what 7 (2) 4 (2) 7 means in the subject line.  I think that makes more sense than trying to reckon up the fraction each time.  I mean, really.  What was I thinking?  So tonight was eventful.  I didn't mention it in my last post, but last week someone actually  stopped me to ask for directions  while I was running--while there were  other people  around.  I wrote it off to the absurdity that is present in everyday society, but today, as I ran towards an elderly man who was carrying his dog, he asked me, "Are you jogging?"  Of course I am!  Do I look like I'm, for example, fishing?  Could the direction-asker and the elderly man really not tell?  Do I just look like I'm going for a leisurely stroll?  Then, as I was running along on the sidewalk next to the park, a snivelling brat kicked his football at me, hard.  I don't think he appreciated it when I called him a "little prick."  But he was.  I hope he falls out of a tree and breaks his ankle in three places.  I now have comments, so if you feel the need to tell me what a heartless, child-hating bitch I am, please feel free.  I like these new Blogger templates; they're pretty.I know, it was a week.  I am trying.  ("You can say that again, ha ha!")  (Ahh, do you see what I did there?: I used the word "trying" as a verb, and then pretended that someone else implied that it was used as an adjective.  Ahhhh!)  Anyway, so when I went out, I said to myself, "Self, why not just run until you really feel like you have to stop, instead of adhering rigidly to this schedule?"  So I did.  And I ran for 6 minutes.  Now, I wasn't really all that tired after 6 minutes (compared to the last 6 minutes I did, anyway).  It's not my legs that complain, and I don't get cramps in my sides or anything.  The main problem that makes me have to stop is my chest/lungs aching.  I've always been this way and thought it was normal, but  urlLink this page says it's not .  Hmmm.  So I had to walk for 2 minutes until my lungs stopped aching, then I did 4 minutes running again, then 2 minutes walking, then the final 6 minutes running.  If you're thinking that a full 20 minutes of running shouldn't be that hard to achieve, remember that I've been totally,  totally  inactive for a year.I think that running is akin to childbirth in some respects (not that I've ever given birth): while you're doing it, it's painful and terrible and you can't imagine ever doing it again, not in a million years, and you curse the bastard that got you into it in the first place (in running's case, yourself).  But then it's over, and you have a shower, and you sit down to blog about it, and it feels great.  Running, that is.  My analogy ended in the first paragraph.  You weren't still trying to make it work for this one, were you?  Anyway, I didn't do myself any favors by not running for nearly a week.  In case you're curious, a combination of factors including illness, DIY-mania, and heavy rain contributed to my sloth.  Tonight I went out thinking, "Do I really have to bother with the run-walk nonsense?  Can't I just run out for 10 minutes, then run back for 10 minutes?"  The answer is no.  I did the same run as before, and by the end of the second repetition I looked over at my house (which faces the park) and seriously considered running home right then, jumping the fence, and going in the back door.  Then I remembered that my back door was locked (safety first, kids!) and that in order to get home I'd have to go back the way I came, round the corner, and down the road again.  And by the time I thought of all the logistics, my repetition was over.  Later, something funny happened on my 4th repetition: I started running, and suddenly the 3 minutes was over, just like that.  I thought I must have shortchanged myself or read my watch wrong, but no: it just went like a hot knife through butter.  Mmmm, butter.  Ahh, that's the other thing.  I haven't had much food today, which might have contributed to my near crash early in the run.  I tried to eat a toasted bacon and guacamole sandwich for lunch, but someone really needs to tell the ladies in the canteen that guacamole should only be served ice cold.  Hot guacamole is nastified.  Oh well, at least there were pink wafers in the tea room.I haven't just dropped off the face of the earth.  I went on holiday to the US, where it would be almost rude to exercise.  I'm back now, and as soon as I'm over my jetlag I'll be back in the saddle/running shoes.Run Along Now has moved  urlLink over here !

Hey there.  How are things?  Iggbalbollywall says: not too bad...thought i was going to work yesteray; the car had other ideas  Yipee Keye-yeah says: So, it's getting better at least. That's good. The journal didn't instill me with a lot of confidence. I'd hate to see it go back to what it was, especially after you've been relatively happy for a while.  Iggbalbollywall says: oh yeah? what were your impressions?  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Not good. You're an awesome writer, of course, but I'm worried about you.   Iggbalbollywall says: ehh.. got thruogh before, and this time doesn't involve sharp objects Yipee Keye-yeah says: Yeah, well, I hope so.  A couple of coworkers just walked in and coincedentaly dropped off a bunch of stuff I wanted to borrow...it's like Christmas - extended LOTR DVD, PS2 and bunch of games, etc...   Ahhh...  *sigh*  Gonna be a great weekend! What else is going on?   Iggbalbollywall says: not too much, really, trying to figure out my day, might update the blog for the second time today  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Ah. I'll look forward to reading about all the positive things going on in your life now.  Iggbalbollywall says: updated daily, baybe  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Ah, that's funny!  I like the latest one...  Iggbalbollywall says: what else do you think i should mention?  Yipee Keye-yeah says: "unholy interest" heh In the Blog?  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Not sure...but I have a good handle, I think, on the problems. I want to hear about how great it is to be out of Calgary, living with Kurt, being a zoo caretaker, etc.  You don't talk about that stuff much anymore so it's a treat for me.    Iggbalbollywall says: aah...zee zoo..any other requests?  Yipee Keye-yeah says: Not sure...I don;t know what's going on in your life, really. Fill me in. Write a passage to me and I'll be happy.

He delievers pizza, and is generally pissed off at the world in a standup comedian type of way. He kept me sane in Calgary.   This guy from India is chatting me up on ICQ. I�ve noticed it comes in waves, every tard from India messages me for a month, then the Egyptians step up, then the folks from Sweden.  	Was all ready to go to work yesterday morning, despite the lesser rings of hell my head was in. I was pumped, out to placate the masses with an opiate (flair for the melodramatic much?). And, the car would not start. Not even a click. The battery was drained. For about 30 minutes, I truly felt I was life�s bitch, then I decided to shampoo the carpet, do the dishes, and phone people for The Cause as �Gentlemen Prefer Blondes� played demurely on the tube. I got one call back that didn�t pan out. So I ate some potatoes in a sauce from one of those envelopes, watched law and order, and felt sorry for myself a bit more. The pity party was ceased due to fatigue. I napped my brains out while Kurt tackled the laundry.  	I get in touch with the boss man today. Yikes. Is he going to believe my fabulous non-luck? Do I mention to him I�m a leeeeeeetle crazy? These are the questions I�d rather curl up into a ball and not deal with. There�s a crazy woman who keeps sending me messages on machine, evidently suffering from an emergency concerning her cable. Since I don�t actually deal with cable, and I gave her a thing with the Company�s number on it, I didn�t ever return her myriad of calls. I�m a jerk who sells dishes, but, in my defence, I don�t get paid, and in fact lose money whenever a fool calls me to complain about something. A typical compliant call lasts about forty minutes. Most of the time, the complaint has to deal with some aspect the client didn�t understand, so I get to go through the process with them again. If it�s not misunderstanding, it�s late installation, which has nothing to do with me, I�m not told the intsaller�s name, company or phone number. All right, that�s all for me, must attend to Cordy, who has taken an unholy interest in my underwear.this is from Jace.... You know, I feel a little weird muscling in (a laughable thought if you've ever seen me) on Robyn's coloumn, but it was a such a brilliant idea that I thought I should do it too.  However, I didn't want to copy my friend or steal the idea, so I decided to join her instead.  And she was gracious enough to allow me an occasional (yeah, right, I'll wear out my welcome in a matter of hours) cameo.  So I was at work today, driving pizza around, and I had to take an order to Sir John A Macdonald School.  Now I've never been there before, but apparently, it was one of three schools in the same parking lot thingy.  It was dark, and the damned schools don't have lights, and I was like "Uh, where is it?".  So I stop to ask this kid.  He was like twelve, small, typicial nerdy looking kid (ok, he was me when I was that young), sitting waiting for the bus.  I rolled down my window to ask him, and he took three leaps back from my car.  Like I was going to try and entice him into my tiny ass Samurai with pizza or something.  Can't fault the kid though, he was being smart.  Anyway, so I'm like "Hey, where's Deifenbaker (another of the schools there)."  He pointed behind me and hollered "there."  That's when my brain (which is usually a few seconds behind my mouth) kicked in and told that I already knew where Deif was (I had driven Meghan there several times).    So I tried again.  "I mean MacDonald."  The kid pointed even further behind me to the other side of Deif to where the Macdonalds restaurant and the Seven Eleven were.  "It's back there, the Big Yellow M gives it away."  Inwardly I groaned, but the kid had wit.  In spite of myself, I grinned.  "The school, Sir John A." I clarified.  He threw a backward gesture to the other brown brick cube on the corner.  "I can't get there from southbourn 4th St, can I?"  The kid shook his head.  "Nope, you'll have to go around."  So I turned around (going out the in ramp and diving over a few curbs) and went north on 4th, turned right onto 68th Ave to center and south to 64th, and then drove right past the entrance I needed to use, so I had to do it all again.  As much fun as driving in circles truly is, not so much when you're paid by the delivery.  So I finally get to the place, and get out of the car with the six larges, and I get swamped by dozens of chest high kids all shouting out for pizza.  I would have beaten them to pulp with my tire iron if I had had a free hand, but I finally got inside to the main office.  There I met a teacher in gym shorts and wearing a whistle around her neck (can you say humina humina humina) and I was looking for a Wade Copper.  Now I've known females named Wade before (ever see Sliders?), so I was hoping that she was the one.  Nope, turned out to be a bigger version the directions kid from the bus stop (I shudder to think that that would be me if I lived that long, which I won't)  And his name was Cooper, not Copper.  Some retard at work doesn't know how to spell.  And her name starts with L and rhymes with Xena.  Anyway, one of the other teachers got at the pizza and snagged a slice before Mr Cooper showed, but he caught the guy eating it when he came in.  He gave me a dirty look.  "I'm not paying for it if it's got a slice missing."  I groaned.  He looked serious, and it was a sixty dollar bill.  Then he smiled and gave me seventy bucks.  SCORE.  So I boogied (as in hurried, not as in 'EWWWW, Pick yer nose') back to the store and in the parking lot in front of the store, there are rows that people are supposed to park in that are contained by cement islands (Kurt knows what Im talking about, he used to work there, in fact, he got me my job there), and when the lots filled, people sometimes park on the other side of the islands in the place where you drive through.  So theres this woman driving a burgundy Buick Regal parked on the outside, and instead of pulling out foward and merging into the lane, she backs into one of the aisles.  Only she doesn't know the dementions of her car, and she backs right into the ass end of a parked brand new, all clean and shiny blue Monte Carlo.  Ouch.  I see this as I drive past, and I'm like "Whoa, that's gotta suck."  but you know what happened then?  Yep, that's right.  The bitch drove away, dragging a peice of the other car's bumper along with her.  I was livid.  But I was too far away to get her liscence number, and the lot was so blocked I couldn't hang a louie and follow her.  It was nuts.  Well, there is it, my first (and hopefully not last) cameo into the wild world of Robynism.  Quack.  Signed: The Angry Mallard Duck.So, really thought I was getting better, was sure that I would be able to work yesterday. I woke up at five, did the blog, fed the animals, and read. Kurt woke up as I was starting to fall back to sleep.  	Kurt woke me up around two thirty in the afternoon. I was shaking, almost incoherent, headache, feverish, and ready to vomit. In other words, despite the dramatic increase in my hours of sleep, I felt like it was my first day of withdrawal. Yow. 	 So yesterday was a non day.  	But, Kurt got groceries, I was able to stand up long enough to do the dishes, and thusly, for a non day, not so bad. Oh, and one of our foster kitties, the Terror, formerly known as Raccoon got adopted yesterday. And I never took a picture of him, or his lovely sisters. We�re foster parents for a non-kill humane society. Homeless kitties come to our places, get socialized, and go to homes. It�s wonderful, but Terror was with us for a while, and I was starting to get attached. So was Cordy, our puppy. Those two were curled up together constantly, play fought, and when Terror got a nasty skin allergy, Cordy was the nursemaid. And when Terror left, Cordy tried to get through the window. She fell asleep, then got up, and sniffed the apartment thoroughly looking for him. It was pretty sad, but we�re also getting more kittens to socialize soon. My landlord mentioned that he wasn�t all that impressed with the Zoo, but he hasn�t decided to take any action, most likely because we got his wife�s permission beforehand� (hahahaa!) Besides, it�s not like our apartment is dirty, since I�m a clean freak and all. (messy, oh hell yes, but never dirty.) 	I�m going to try for being a productive little salesfreak today. I also pass in a resume to a coffee shop today as well. Baker! Twenty hours a week, but I figure I need something, somewhere that gives me a measure of job satisfaction. Being the door to door opiate pusher is not doing it for me, and although I do enjoy it to a certain extent, at least with the baker job, there�s no commission so it�s something a bit steady to supplement the unsteady. 	My boss asked again what I have that has been incapacitating me. I covered it with the blood work that I got done Monday, �they don�t know yet.� I am so much at a loss as to what to tell him. I am worried that he�ll find a way to relieve me of work (Yeah, it�s not legal, to discriminate because of illness, but if he wanted to, he�d find a way to work around it) I also really respect and like the guy. I�m worried that he�ll think differently about me, lose respect for me, etc. I know it sounds silly, but this is Old School Rural Land, where any sort of medication for a mental illness is termed �Nerve Pills�. 	Oh hey, update on that whole undergrad thing. I�ve got it. When my university gets the transfer credit from this summer, I�m officially done. (I guess I�m informally done now)A friend wrote with reference to my one of my blog entries. He asked me �what makes a person more, or less?� this is reference to me writing earlier that I feel less with this illness.  Boy, do I ever. I guess the important thing to note here is that feelings do not give a person an accurate sense of reality. As a really lame example, you may feel purple. You don�t look purple, you don�t smell purple, but purple you really, really feel you are. How many times have your feelings fooled you? How many times have you thought you were in love, then, all of the sudden, you really fell in love, and you realised the feelings previous were fondness, lust, or a combination of these and other feelings? 	Feelings can betray you. For me, they do to the point of messing up my worldview, my sense of reality, in such a way that I don�t know my arse from my elbow. I have no idea what I look like, save for in the vaguest sense (I have brown hair, brown eyes, I�m about 160 cm. My hair is long and curly. I don�t know if I am overweight, although I know I am not skinny. People vary when they tell me what I look like, I�ve been compared to everyone from Eddie Vedder to Julia Ormond. Basically, I don�t know what I look like to others. I suppose it doesn�t matter. I�d still like to know, though) 	My reality right now is that I am less than pretty much everyone. Less because I see myself as not functioning properly. I am hard pressed to cite someone I view as less than me, because, like everybody, I give other people the benefit of the doubt. Of course, I�m not as forgiving with myself. Stupid, really, but I don�t have much control over what I feel, and, maybe the essence of this illness is that your feelings control you, whereas perhaps a healthy person would be able to dismiss, get over, or otherwise cope with these feeling of worthlessness, doubt, self-loathing, etc.  	What is a person worth? If you are human, according to Christian doctrine, you are worth Jesus Christ. (Please note the requirement is merely being human. Not a  damn thing else.) Pretty amazing, not to mention scary. If you are a Buddhist, your worth your service and compassion to other people, but the ultimate truth there is that you are nothing in the end, soulless (according to some sects). You are a non-self connected to the divine. Most folks, well, I think it�s pretty individual as to what they feel they�re  worth, so I�ll say, I�m not sure. 	What are my family members worth? (This includes, friends, my husband, my dear and precious animals) Before, I would say that I�d die for them. Now, what I�m saying is that I�m trying to live for them. They are worth me trying my hardest to get out of the funk I�m in, and they�re worth me growing old with them, and seeing them grow old. Holding their hand when they�re sick, getting silly drunk if the situation calls for it, sharing my experiences with them. This is what they�re worth.  	What am I worth? I wish I knew.   	I am going to write more later dealing with daily events. And, as I don�t know why my new settings aren�t taking, I�ll leave a note here; if you want to give me feedback, whether it be to ask a question, give me advice, or to let me know I�m a big moron, and, were this a hardcopy journal, you wouldn�t wipe your ass with the pages. You know, anything. My email address is trickyhighlands@hotmail.comI don�t know why it�s bothering me so much. It�s natural, tons of people get them, it�s pretty easy to treat, and aw, fuck it. I think it�s horrible. Somewhere along the way, most likely from being in customers� houses all over, I contracted head lice. HEAD LICE! 	I�ve never had them before. All I have (had) were nits, just weird little eggs of the blood sucking parasites. I home remedied it, as I am not interested at all in being treated with chemicals. So, it was mayonnaise on my head for two hours, under a plastic bag, under a towel. I smelled fan-fucking-tastic. After this, Kurt fine combed my hair, pulled out all the nits he could find. I made him do it twice more, he couldn�t find any. 	This is what it looked like. http://www.headlice.org/faq/notnit.htm I also got the confirmation here that mayo works just as well on lice as many other products, without the pesticide component that those pesticides offer. Don�t get me wrong. I may still get the pesticide, but that�ll be when my next scheduled dosing is (in a week). An interesting side note, after the saladirific experience, my hair is crazy shiny, manageable, and generally nice to touch and look at. 	In other news, Kurt and I got help from the University Chaplain here. He arranged for us to get a food voucher from the grocery store, and a raid to the local church�s Public Cupboard. We now have canned food, and tomorrow, 50 bones worth of groceries. This is a great and unexpected relief. Of course, I feel guilty about it, I�m of the mind that we didn�t need the food, we weren�t in dire straits. Some one else, on the other hand, might be, and he or she might have wanted that can of re-fried beans. However, after eating something other than porridge, and getting a call to pay some miscellaneous bill, I�m thankful. The money I get at the end of the month can go to the bill paying, instead of the food buying. Words can�t express how utterly thankful I am, despite my stupid guilty feelings.  	How did I get lice? I feel like Pigpen from �peanuts�. Yeah, yeah, I know they don�t care how clean you are, but I remember being a kid, and a teen and a young adult around home. I was taught, not so much by what my parents said, but how people acted when the term �lice� was applied anywhere. Poor hygiene was implied. So, hey, at least this is a lesson in humilty, I�m not going to make a face or go �eeewwww� when someone talks about lice in the future. The funny thing is, a really good friend of mine found out her infestation, and that�s what drove me to get my head checked. I didn�t think she was gross, I remember thinking that she had real shitty luck. I get it, and I�m Pigpen. Go figure. 	I hope to be out and about to my loyal satellite-buying public tomorrow. Also, on Thursday, I apply for a part time bakery job. I figure I need some sort of job satisfaction somewhere, as I�m developing moral issues about selling lots of TV to people. I feel like an ignorance peddler. I am an ignorance peddler. It�s a living I guess.oh hey, missed the flea market, they were right...for every cloud there really is a silver lining.4.12 am    	It�s been rainy and wet here for the last week or so. I think I�d almost prefer snow to it; nothing gets done with the rain. It rains, it gets dried up, all in all, I prefer lasting evidence of precipitation. Of course, on our sojourn here, I failed to pack mitts, scarves, hats, etc.  (Hey now, it was august, who thinks months in advance? I even forgot socks�) 	Another sleepless night for me. I hate it, not sleeping is uncomfortable at the least for me, but at the same time, I enjoy the prescribed silence, the aloneness. It�s not like it was for me in the past (I�ve been a veteran insomniac since high school) I was lonely then. Nighttimes were peaceful, but sad. My family, friends, pets, roommates all were breathing quietly, sleeping, as if it were no effort. Kurt, however, has given me permission to wake him, and I�ve only done so once, but it gives me a lot of comfort to know that I can wake him up if I need to, and that he won�t be pissy at me for doing so.  	Watched a documentary on depression last night. It didn�t tell me anything terrifically new, as I�m morbidly informed on this disease and its treatments. One thing interested me though; patients with depression, as well as other mental disorders have a marked difference in their brains. That means a person can see it. They can see the disease, detect it, look at it, and be able to say �Yes. This is a physical thing.� My extended family on my mothers� side have always had the notion that depression was a character flaw; that I could snap out of it at any time. When my meds began to work, they advised me to get off the drugs, that I clearly didn�t need them anymore. I would patiently explain that the reason I was better was because I was taking the pills, that ceasing them would, or �the dope� as my grandmother calls it. Among the other notions they have: I�m lazy, irresponsible, and unstable. It�s hard to argue with the last, I�m lazy because the drugs I were on that �helped� me �sleep� knocked me out cold for twelve hours. I slept during the day (because when I didn�t take my pills, nights were spent like this.) I�m not sure where the irresponsible thing came in. It is consoling that they take the same hard line against every one else in the family. Different criticisms, same results; the frustration that abounds in the accused, and the pressing need of the same to avoid the family. 	My puppy, Cordy, a loveable half-Rotweiler, half Shepard, jumped into the shower with us this evening. Of course, since the opportunity presented itself, Kurt and I gave her an impromptu bath. She was unimpressed with us, but still maintains the same ardour and zeal for the bathroom. Lucas, my pride and joy, will not go near the bathroom, even if there were an entire rump roast on the floor. He hates water. Ironic, since his heritage gives him webbed feet and a coat designed to get wet. 	  Everyone must experience this guy's paintings. They�re wonderful, surreal, and disturbing.  http://www.markryden.com/  Blood test tomorrow (later!) to determine if i have another illness. I almost wish i did, missing work would feel more leigitimate to me.Good morning,  Its unfortunate the only time I feel awake in the morning is when I�m looking at the wrong end of it. Went to the doctor, told him about the stupid symptoms I had. He was very sympathetic, didn�t tell me anything useful except why taking tryptophan at this juncture wouldn�t be the best idea; and he gave me more Prozac. I went home; fell asleep (ASLEEP!!! Thank you, God) at 11 or so. Woke up at three, and here were are, 5.29am. Kurt has a weird staph infection, and I�m hoping I won�t be pooping green and yearning to vomit on Sunday. Sunday is Flea Market Day. This is when Kurt and I get to experience the flea market culture, rife with ten thousand year old ladies selling ten thousand year old lace doilies. At least twice during this period a guy will tell me how he�s going to sue the company I�m working for, because of some misunderstanding (usually on the guy�s behalf.) I use my conflict management training, and sit there, speaking softly, while these retards spew spittle over me in an attempt to illuminate why me selling satellites for this company is, in fact, an evil thing. Why these guys feel the need to expouse their problems that occurred three years ago with me, a person that can�t do anything for them, doesn�t care, and had nothing to do with their unfortunate situation is beyond me. I�m polite, but at the same time, I can feel the burning in my cheeks, and the need to freak out at them. Especially when his yelling (why is it always a guy?) draws the attention of a few locals. I hate drawing attention to myself, especially when some one else draws attention for me.  	These freaks are few and far between. The other sellers in the place are interested to know how you�re doing; they�re genuinely concerned and curious about you. They�re also extremely friendly, something I take great comfort in at 7am. 	I�ve got to stop researching the drugs I�m on. Everything I find makes them look scarier and scarier, I want to run into the woods and never see a doctor again. There�s always some horrible trade-off, leastwise, for me; like take an anti-depressant to alleviate depressive symptoms (you know, to protect yourself from your own urges to kill yourself), and throw your circadian rhythm out the window, enjoy the shakes and paranoia as a result. What�s worse, the control or the disease?  I don�t think it matters, as my choices are limited. I will not willingly become suicidal again. I almost destroyed my family, a lot of my friendships, and my extended family looks on me as lazy and weak (They�re old school; they keep telling me to get off the dope.) 	I met a girl with similar problems on playsite.com; she said her major thing to deal with is that she knows she�s not going to be a fully functioning member of society. She�s never been able to keep a job longer than six months. This is an echo of me; I�ve never been able to hack working more than 4 months at a time, it takes too much out of me, and when I do a drug changeover, I�m usually out of commission for a few months. 	 It�s hard not to feel lazy and useless.  I do have a lot of things to be thankful for, my parents and my sister don�t always get how I�m feeling all the time (who does?) but they seem to have an infinite amount of understanding, and love for me. Kurt, well, Kurt�s amazing. He�s doing great in school, he�s always got a kind word or an ass-kicking for me. I�m not sure where I�d be at without him. I love them all so much. The animals that have chosen to spend some time with us are awesome. Lucas, my pride and joy, never leaves my side, even if he has to pee, he�ll hold it. Cordy hangs out with me when I�m waiting for some sort of bodily eruption in the bathroom, and the cats take turns licking my eyelids as I fall asleep.  Enough rambling. Time to stare at my ceiling, and hope for sleep.How the hell did i end up with two blogs?Holy crap. My poo is green. I�m close to vomiting, and my head feels half again what it should weigh, and I�d swear I have a fever, but Kurt says I don�t. Ugh. I�m out of books; I�m going to start reading �I am Spock� again. Don�t laugh, it�s a good read. 	Still trying to figure out if I ought to tell supervisor Jim about my health predicament. Right now I�m hoping the extended amount of bed time and poo time will clear enough illness out of my system to do well tomorrow; I am going to another community and working with a new girl who sounds like she�s Miz Saleswoman. Hope she likes me. Hell, I hope I like her. I hope I don�t vomit or crap on her. Or Jim.  	Since I just jumped in on my current situation yesterday, thought I�d give some insight as to what sort of a meat popsicle I am.   Age: 24 Sex: Female Martial Status: Been married since July 16, 2002. Education: Two electives short of an undergraduate degree in Philosophy Favorite Color: blue Current Issues: Major Depression, drug withdrawal, stress about supporting my husband who is, bless him, bettering himself at the university deal. Weirdest Job: Psychic 	 I�ve got a couple of really great stories, about how kurt and I met, how I got through university barely, and family stories and so on. I�ll get to them, I think, but right now I�m using this blog to focus my hazy brain, and deal with this silly shit.  I think I better go back to sleep now.November 18/2002  	Right. So another useless day passes, and I haven�t done anything to make it less useless, unless one counts healing. I wish I did. But, even more, I wish I had have got up at ten this morning and went out, made sales, made Kurt and Jim proud. But instead I woke up on the edges of a nightmare, feverish, nauseated, with a spiked marching band in my head. So I slept; that being what I do best lately, sold no satellite systems. On the plus side, my withdrawal symptoms seem to be levelling off. My hands don�t shake, and I can now eat an entire bowl of porridge with no help from the dog. Yay me. Unfortunately, this does not directly help the financial situation. 	Here is the situation. Kurt and I are living in Atlantic Canada, he�s going to University, and I�m trying to support us. After two months of searching, I found a job selling satellite systems; I get paid solely by commission. We�re behind on our rent; approximately a month and a half. One month behind on car payment. Two months behind on our phone bill. 45 dollars below our Visa limit. Perhaps this does not come off as stressful as it is to me. The added thing is I have major depression, been fighting it with varying degrees of success for years, and I have trouble being in public.  Recently, I made the executive decision to come off my medication; to rid myself of an anti-psychotic that has been knocking me unconscious for a year. I was put on the pills to get rid of �impulsive tendencies�, although my tendencies were only two events. The doctors said since my three suicide attempts were largely unplanned, I would benefit from being on a drug that would help me relax, help me think things through. It was also to help me sleep; but like I said before, it was more of a being hit with a cast iron skillet without the head trauma. 20 minutes after I took the required dose, I couldn�t speak coherently, couldn�t remember things. The morning after, I could not remember things that happened, sometimes as far back as an hour before I took the meds. On several occasions, when trying to go to work in the morning, I would come close to getting into car accidents. It had to stop, and as of last week, I�m off the damn things. The withdrawal has been moderately awful, interfering with this job, my self worth, and my body. It has occurred to me, however, that I should not be experiencing withdrawal symptoms on medication my doctor prescribes me. 	I�m also on an anti depressant, of course. This drug, number six of tried anti-depressants, is working well. I haven�t tried, or thought seriously of killing myself. Sometimes I can even see that the mess I�m in is not as nearly as grave as I think it is.  	This illness, and even more so, the drugs I�ve been on to combat it, has been a major �I don�t know, upset? Block? Huge pain in my arse and the arses of people I love? Yeah. I had to leave school three times. I was supposed to graduate in 2000 from my undergrad, but I couldn�t do it. And I told no profs; so I really let myself down that way, I found out later there tends to be options for people like me. I know that now, but I had no idea then. Here�s my question. What about me now? Do I tell my boss I have this illness, this thing I see often as being a weakness? My boss�s boss? Do I suck it up, and do my best, even though I know there�s going to be days, weeks, and maybe even months and years like this? Is it an excuse for my laziness, or is it a reason? How about a reason to fire me? 	I keep thinking that maybe if I wasn�t like this, I�d be a good worker. I�d be a university graduate. I�d be, I don�t know, more, perhaps. Less scared. I know thinking like this is a trap. I can�t stop thinking like this. I am waiting for that other shoe to drop, and me trying to avoid that shoe dropping is a nail I�m going to step on barefoot.  	And, my God, there is a dramatic difference in everything when I sleep the entire night. I�ve slept about fourteen hours the last week. I�m sleeping longer lately, which is truly amazing, but it feels like my body is now catching up on all the sleep it�s missed the last few years. The unconsciousness that I put on myself with the anti psychotics was merely that; there was nothing restful about it. I wasn�t lulled into sleep, I was forced unconscious. In order to be the slightest bit functional, I had to have at least ten hours of this unconsciousness. My relatives think me lazy, and treat me as such. Sometimes I agree with them. I could not wake up unless someone had waked me; if there were no noises to wake me, I would continue sleeping; I think my longest stint like this was about twenty-four hours. At the time, I was living by myself, the dog had no inclination to go outside, and no one phoned or visited during that twenty four hour period. 	I should stop whining. There are so many people out there who have it worse than me. But I can�t seem to let it go, this stupid weird brokenness.One of my first memories is my great grandmother. She told me some stuff, most of which I don�t remember, except that she told me I was special, and something about the sight.  The next memory was of Grammy�s wake. It was before there was a wake house home, so the people were waked for three days in their own house. The dearly departed were not to be left alone for this period, and for some reason I forget, the mirrors were covered. Anyways, I remember Grammy lying in the casket, and one of the first things my Dad told me was to stay away from the stairs. No one was allowed upstairs, for any reason. So, my rebellious three year old ass attempts the stairs, steep stairs, had to climb up on all fours. Got to the second one and I was frozen to the spot, when I began to whimpered, I was released, and plunked down on my baby butt. Throughout my life, there was always something off about the house, no one wanted to go visit Uncle Paul, and weird stories surfaced. As space is limited in the family homesteads, and Paul�s was vacated, my sis, her boyfriend (Pikey) and me and Kurt bunked there. The theme of the stay was frustration. Sis and Kurt were at odds, Sis and Pikey were WAY at odds, and I was immensely frustrated with myself, I was forgetting things, my weak stomach was not allowing me to help clean up, the thought of the bathroom had me dry heaving, so on and so forth. Kurt became sullen and withdrawn, Sis was uberbitch, and I was looking for any excuse to get the heck outta dodge.  K, I admit, pretty innocuous so far. But the thing was, I know Kurt and sis better than pretty much anybody else, and they were not themselves. Sis, for example, is bitchy, but not in the particular way she was whilst there. And Kurt can get all sullen, but never self-pitying, never angry in the I�m-sixteen-I�m-Pissed-I�ll-Show-Them sort of way. And I�ve been depressed, oh my Lord have I been depressed, but I�ve never been the sort to run away, I�m definitely more of a �fuck it� sort, and stick it out. Know the poem about the guy whose head is bloody, but unbowed? That�s me, stubborn arse. So there was that. Then, there was the ghost poo. But I�m going to leave you hanging for a bit more, as I want to go over in my head the other events that transpired at the House.  As for right now, the Boss man wants me to sell 20 dishes. So far I sold one. I may be in trouble, but at least, today, I saw The Two Towers. Only nineteen more to go, right?    Also, the person that came up with brush on chocolate is a fricken genius.   That�s all for now, Happy New Year.   PS- Great to read your stuff, blogger newbies. Your best bet on posting sucessfully is to write it all in microsoft word, than pasting it rather than writing it all on the edit page.My Christmas Vacation   So, did I mention that I have really got a weak stomach? I think it�s an after-withdrawal recovery thing, but no matter. What is important is that I have a weak stomach, and Kurt is a shit connoisseur; he can tell type of animal, condition of said animal, and perhaps even what the animal has eaten all on the basis of a stool sample. These are the two important things to note when I explain a thing or three about Christmas this year. 	We were staying at Crazy Uncle Paul�s place. Paul has not, nor has ever been my uncle. He�s not crazy either, just pretty bizarre. He likes to scare people. He was pretty famous in my community for having a bunch of twenty something stoners always at his place. They�d get high, and Paul would fuck with them. He�d say stuff like he was the devil, that he controlled the weather. Explains a lot about me really; I have this tendency to lie to people I don�t respect, or when I�m really cranky. Not very nice, I admit. Once, I was in the airport with a doped-up Lucas, preparing for a six hour flight. I typically have Lucas� stripe in the middle of his head painted a color, purple or blue, but on this occasion, his stripe was pink. Prreeeeeetttyyy. It was five in the morning, and a stewardess asked me if Lucas had just had an operation. I told her that he was the first dog to be a recipient of a monkey brain. I AM A BITCH�she said �Really? He had a brain transplant?�   �No. Not really,� I bratted, and walked away.   Anyways, Paul is like this to a truly extraordinary degree. He�s the type of guy that, when you�re doing dishes, he�d stand behind you, really close, and not say anything. When you turn around, you�d get the living shit scared out of you.   Paul had one of these stoners hanging out with him a little more than the others. He had convinced himself that Paul was the devil. He stabbed Paul in the jugular. Paul, all 65 or so years of him walked the 45 meters to his brothers place, holding his hand to his neck, and his brother drove him to the hospital. Luckily, Paul had taken a month long respite from his alcoholism, and he lived. In the police statement, it was written that the stoner kid had whimpered �Oh no, he�s going to kill us all!� and vamoosed out of the house.   That�s the end of the digression, like I said, the important bits are that A) Kurt is a shit conniseur  and B) I have a weak stomach.   Oh, and the house is haunted, but tough shit, you�ll read about it tomorrow.The doctor was a short man with dead blue eyes, and he made no attempt to make me be a patient of his. It was a good meeting.  Going to go back home on Sunday, I think. Kurt�s a little bit worried that I�ll spontaneously combust or some such; the last time we went home, I had a meltdown. It�s wonderful there; the land, the friends, but every time I go home, I feel rootless, and that bothers me. No closure on the house I grew up in; it was sold and vacated, and moved in by new people all when I was in school. I never think it�ll be perfect, but I guess I always go home thinking it will be �relaxing�. The, my oversensitive ass will visit my grandmother, and I�ll become whingy.   Reading the Screwtape Letters, by C.S Lewis. It�s dedicated to J.R.R Tolkien, and on the first page there is a little blurb on the only way to beat the devil. Laughter is the key; the devil can�t handle mockery.  An excellent point, really. Shitty situations aren�t conducive to laughter, but damn, if you can muster some laughter up, you have that craptacular situation by the balls. One of the people I looked up to said that as well, the guy used o pick on me, and I�d try to pick back, and no go; he�d laugh at me. I learned this skill and applied it, I was virtually un-pickable for a while. It left, to a certain degree when I got sick, and everything became personal. Everything. The paint on the walls was a testament to how lame I was. My brain took everything my ears heard, and picked out the worst impossible interpretation. Oh well, I�m going to get that back. I�m not planning on becoming an insensitive ass, but my coping mechanisms have been shit for a few years, so a recapitulation is necessary.  I can�t wait to go  to the two towers!YESTERDAY  In a pretty maudlin mood lately, that�s why I haven�t been writing, I�d like to try to keep my whining at a minimum. But you know, I�m sitting here, listening to Sigur Ros, just after watching �It�s A Wonderful Life,� and I�m drifting off into sad sackness. Was thinking about my parents earlier, wondering if they�re okay. I talk to them, sure, but my parents are not the most vocal of people sometimes, especially when they think information they have may depress me. Understandable, but then I get to thinking about what sort of state their in, and my imagination is about 5 times worse than real life most days. Mom�s not putting up a tree this year, since I�m out, my sister is out, her boarder is out, and that leaves her and Dad. Usually, she has her friend and son over, but this year they�re Christmasing elsewhere. Mom and her brother are on the outs. So, pretty lonely time for them in the big bad city.  Landlord dropped by yesterday, we owe him a grand as of January first. Forget the other bills. Car insurance is up the 20th December, so I�m taking out a payday loan from money mart tomorrow.   I�m in sort of weird headspace right now. I want to go home, but at the same time, not. Home is where? No house where I  grew up in, my parents are provinces away, my extended family, oh sweet Jesus, my extended family- they made a large three hour production about how lazy I am  because I don�t match my socks. My grandmother greets me with either �You�ve gained weight.� Or, the more positive �You didn�t gain weight.� My sis is there, and three of my very dear friends, but the social niche I had there once is pretty shot. Nobody�s fault, stuff changes all the time, and I know I�ve not been the most charitable of friends. I completely lost patience with a friend I�ve has since adolescence. We have a longstanding disagreement. I think she�s an idiot. She thinks I�m an idiot. Somewhere along the way, our priorities changed. There�s a saying; your friends know your faults, and they like you anyway. Me and this girl (Let�s call her Cornflake Girl) got to that point where we saw each other�s faults, and couldn�t reconcile them anymore. I was too hurt, she was too henpecked by me, and there you go.  CG, however, is an integral part of the aforementioned social circle. There are three of us in this group. CG and I don�t get along. CG and Traveler don�t get along real well. And then there�s Closed Door. CD and CG get along all right, Traveler and CD are having troubles, and Traveler is also having the same sort of problem I had with CG. In other words, it�s sort of like an after-school drama gone horribly awry. And to be completely pragmatic, it�s a huge pain in the ass to go deal with.  But the ass pain is worth seeing Traveler, Sweetness, and Solace. Guess I�m just sick of things being one annoying slog after another. Ever notice how things seem heavier after a rough day, a bout of depression, or constipation? It�s like that, I think.  I know a few of you have been reading and thinking �Oh shit, she�s going to by a gun, and after killing everyone else that�s ever pissed her off, she�s going to turn the gun on herself� Not so. These articles are an excerpt, taken out of context. Don�t get me wrong, the feelings are real, but I�m not going to write about everything that happens, so that leaves out a lot of the good an indifferent stuff that happens during the run of the day. What ends up on these articles is stuff I can�t seem to shake off.  It�s easy for me, and unfortunate, that I forget the amazing sex I had this morning, the kid that I made faces with at the doctors office the other day, the most relieving pee I ever had yesterday, and petting the two adorable fat puppies in Ass End with Pink the other week.  Nah, that isn�t the stuff I end up thinking about at the end of the day. And it really should be, so, as a way to ease the minds of my Dear Avid Reader, I�ll put in one good thing I remember from the day I write. If there isn�t anything, I�ll put in a funny joke or website. Sound cool? All righty. I�ll start this tomorrow, or the next journal entry.     K, so since I didn�t get on last night to post, this is my next entry. In order to pay for insurance, I had to get a pay day loan, drove into Zee City, hung out with The Boy Named Sue for a while. Most of the day, actually. He�s going to ask his girl to marry him. Lucky girl, I thought, The Boy Named Sue is  an excellent catch. So, I spent many hours laughing my ass of at his jokes, drank green tea, it was nice. Nicer to come home to Kurt and the Zoo, though. I did not get the pay day loan, as I had out an out-of-province check, I haven�t been employed for six months, and I didn�t take a phone bill with me. These nuances would have been helpful on the phone, rather than driving 2 hours for little reason.  Boy named Sue, like many other people I know, wanted to get the skinny on being married.  I told him that it was the same as not being married, and living together, except it�s completely different. The difference is subtle, but all encompassing; like waking up one morning and seeing everything in color when you�re accoustmed to seeing in black and white. Your brain take a while to process it, and then, everything is new.  I go to the head shrinker tomorrow. I do not want to go, but it�s the right thing to do I suppose. Details to follow....We were promoted in the flea market world, instead of being banished to Siberia of the mall; we are now right by the front doors. The new view has a tantalizing glimpse of Tim Horton�s. Rockabilly Christmas music is tootling out of ceiling speakers and the last flea market of the season is not this week, as I anticipated, but next. There�s no way in hell I�m going next week. It was an act of supreme will to haul my ass out of bed this morning. 	Saw the movie �Blood: The Last Vampire� last night. It was one of those movies that qualify as an experience. Evidently, it took three years to produce, and worth every minute of production. I�m not a huge fan of anime, I�m pretty conservative, and stick with the mainstream anime releases. I always pick up on something inordinately alien about anime. I know the fact that it�s produced by a different culture and all that would account for this, but the alienness of it put me off a bit. With this movie that feeling was largely absent. There was, for example, no kinky cartoon on cartoon sex, and no creatures that were menacing, and somehow sexy at the same time. There were some pretty foul looking creatures, and there was the blood and gore associated with any vampire movie, but, as I said before, nothing alien. Reading this over, I realize that my complaint about anime is vague, and unsubstantial. Here�s an example though, that explains feelings and sensations close to how anime makes me feel; it�s like you�re leaning back in a chair, and suddenly, you get the impression you�re going to fall on the back of your head because you�ve been leaning too far back. As you scrabble around trying not to fall, reality reasserts itself, and you notice you�re in a rocking chair. Take these sense impressions, stretch them out for about and hour and a half, and you get the sense of exhilarating bewilderment that I have watching the-not-so mainstream anime. 	Anyways, �Blood� is a great movie. My only complaint is that it�s too short, it plays out like the first episode of a series. But in this complaint, there is a hope that it will become a series. I read some reviews of it, and the common complaint is that has too many loose ends. I like that about movies though, it makes a person think. (For the exact opposite- �Signs� EVERYTHING tied up perfectly in the end, and I really enjoyed that, too.) 	As for news and excitement, Kurt is finished with exams, and I�m almost done work for the vacation. And I just met a woman whose brother worked at the psychic line I worked at briefly. He is a numerology expert, and is absolutely dizzying with his accuracy. If you�re one of those folks that think that whole deal is full of hooey, contact me for the psychic line number, call it, and ask for Fredrick. You will never doubt again, just make sure you know your birthday, and what time of day you were born. 	I hate the term �psychic�. Intuitive is much, much better. I find people have this notion that we know the future, the lottery numbers, and so on and so forth. Personally, I haven�t met anyone like that. I was just about to write about what sort of gifts I have, but I�m pretty sure I can�t adequately describe them. I can say though, that sometimes, it�s a huge pain in the ass. Remind me to ramble on Disclosure sometime. 	5.22pm: Ate food, did NOOOO housework, and god damn it, I am sleeping in tomorrow. Sold two dishes at the flea market. It would have been three, but one asshole tried to open an account and it was in arrears, so no sale and a pain in my ass for me. Cordy has taken to climbing up on the backs of couches. Also, she likes to try to eat my hair. She�s a weird dog. 	And that�s it, loyal reader.Awoke at 4.30am, and for all intensive purposes, stayed awake. This was indeed most foul. Went back again to Ass End, minus Pink, and got one sale. Hairy is good company. Shared idiotic stories, made fun of people, each other, and so on. My impression of Supreme Boss Man was good, but I kept on wondering what his medic alert bracelet was for, and if he ever got it caught up in his arm hair. He was woolly mammoth hairy. Nice, seemed pretty flippant, and very carefully styled hair; it looked rather like he had separate the hair into clumps 5-9 hairs thick, gelled it, and carefully stood each clump on end in athesthetically pleasing porcupine quills. Why does Cordy get hiccups every three days?  I�m almost to tired to see, so buh bye for now.ahem. That link is   http://www.redmeat.com/redmeat/1999-12-06/index.html  Go to it.Went to what felt like the Ass End of the Universe Wednesday, and walked the entire circumference of ass. Pink and me did the walking, and suffered the inevitable hip, foot and leg pain that followed. WHY are all port towns on a hill? I ask merely for information. Long story short: We came (7.00am-9.00am), we waited, (9.00am-11.00am) we walked, (11.00am-12.30pm, 12.30pm-4.30pm) we sucked. (All hours inclusive) Not a sale, not a person, not the remotest whiff of a possibility of talking to another human being. Pink complained endlessly, I sulked.  	Continuing my sulking vein, I pretended to sleep all the way home last night. Pink wailed on how the day�s work made us look bad, as we gained no sales, and Hairy gained five. I sulked. We got home, and two sales were waiting for me, pretty as you please. Sulking ceased. Went to sleep, woke up around five am, and stayed awake until approximately 9.30am. Fell asleep after I gained the knowledge that we were not returning to Ass End yesterday, talked to a client, and called tech support. Awoke around 1.30pm. Boss Man left three messages all in the tune of-you-never-call-me-back-you�ve-got-to-help-yourself and it�s-far-too-late-for-to be-in-bed. Called him back, explained my schedule, he hemmed and hawed, and there is the distinct possibility I�m on his shit list now. Went out to sell locally in the falling wet slushy snow around 2.30, came back at 4.30, no sale, one near-accident, and three people telling me the had a problem with our company, as the company put Its foot into their ass. Makes me wonder what my predecessors did to these trailer dwellers. No calls tonight, alas, and today; I�m back in Ass End, meeting Boss Man and Supreme Boss Man for breakfast tomorrow. The time of this meeting would be about 9am, so I must arise at the golden hour of 6.00am (It is 0600 hours. What does the 0 stand for? Oh my God, it�s early.) 	The need for meaningful employment is pressing down on my senses. It�s not like this job is torture, but its sheer meaningless makes me want to hork. I can�t get into funky salesgirl mode because, well, I suffer a profound amount of apathy when I consider the product. And the ambitions of my co-workers; to be Sales Rep of the Month, I find pretty laughable. I can�t seem to make myself take pride in the work I�m doing. Picky, Picky, you may be thinking. And, I suppose, you�d be right. However, as I consider the alternative of becoming all peachy with a big heaping side of keen on selling crap-in-a-box, I think, �Hey. Good. I�m not supposed to be all happy about being in retail for the rest of my life. This must mean something vaguely positive.� But, seriously, wouldn�t I be the luckiest carbon-based life form on the planet if sales were my thing? The love of my life? Wow-wee, would things be looking up in both the finances and the self-worth department. (And JP, self worth in this instance is tied in to being successful financially.) 	Go here:	  urlLink    You know what though? Yick. That thought appeals to me almost as much as having maggots for breakfast, lunch and dinner for the rest of my life, all 250 years of it. I�d rather be me, starving writer wannabe, beloved of Kurt, than a hunk-a-hunk-a burning sales rep with piles of money to roll around naked in. 	As for the water under the bridge thing, I�m going to be the mature person I know is lurking in here somewhere and not mention it to that psycho hose beast who besmirched my name. I�m going to sulk about it, probably write maudlin poetry about betrayal, then go have a nap. It�s not like the same thing hasn�t happened to me, you, the guy down the street, your neighbour�s dog, among others ten thousand times, right? No need to dwell, hold a grudge, use voodoo dolls, etc.   	Well, that�s it, that�s all. Off to Ass End I go, to sell dishes, and freeze my own ass end off.Hey hey kids,  Spent time with SB the other satellite guy, and since he is now number uno in the sales world, he is no longer SB. So, now I have to think of a new name for him. Perhaps Hairy, or Number 1. Working with him was awesome, is awesome, and I hope will stay fairly awesome. I guess it is his new attitude, and his willingness to make fun of me, himself, the world, etc. Him, Pink, and myself are off to a community an hour or so away, to spread the joy of satellite systems.   I am addicted to Age of Mythology, even though we just have the demo here at Casa Del Animala. So�if any of you Avid Readers want to get me a present, feel free to pick me up/burn/ steal a copy.  Still horribly behind on the rent, approximately 700 bucks. Forget about the phone, baby, no idea where that total is. Electric bill? Forget about it�.but I think, for the first time in a while, I�m okay about it. Talking to Boss man about my mental state, and his willingness to motivate me by pairing me up with people, sending all of us on these missions away, and, most importantly, his willingness to listen if I need to talk to him is really amazing (Although, I sort of doubt I�m going to be having any heart to heart conversations about me feeling like nut will happen much, if at all. It�s still comforting.)  Should water under the bridge remain so, even after new water is unearthed? Consider this a survey. To sum up, I found out new information, after a relationship had been mended. This information comes close to infuriating to me, mainly because I perceive a dip in opinion from a person I respect. So, should I let it go? Or should I do some confronting?    That�s it for now. Any suggestions for topics will be welcome.Another Sunday at the Flea market of lurrvveee. Well, no. The more appropriate title would be the flea market of Morning People, the flea market of  People Looking for Everything (including the kitchen sink, there�s a sweet little two-basin number across the way from us), or perhaps Flea Market For Those Who Have Nothing Better To Do On A Sunday Morning at 8am. I was thinking about the phenomena of morning people as we were driving here. I�m convinced they�re a different fricken species. Occasionally in my University days (or was it daze?) I�d shuffle into the Meal Hall at 7.30am, usually under duress. There were people there I had NEVER seen before. And on a campus of a thousand, that was interesting. The few other times I went I began to recognize them as those people who run at five am on a Saturday. I never see them at any other time of day, always between the hours of 5 to 8. Extraordinary, really. There�s an entire section of people who are up, awake, and astonishingly, engaging in PHYSICAL ACTIVITY! I wonder sometimes where these people go during normal hours. I suppose work, and school, the farm and suchlike. Maybe they fish. Or maybe, and this thought makes me feel better, they�re in bed.  It is now 10.11 in the am, and the place is crawling with fleas, erm, people. There�s a lady to the left of us selling Canadian geese with sprigs of a pine looking plant, and red berries coming out of its back. Charming.  Another chick is selling the toys that come free from Happy Meals, among various other assorted crap. I think she�s selling a bucket of loose legos. This is excitement. Truly.  Ok, well, I�m lying, the highlight of my day so far was a geriatric who had troubles with his remote, we discussed, and ascertained that his remote was killing batteries on him too fast.   I told the boss guy about being sick. He admitted that he didn�t understand what it was like, but he�ll help me out. He even said that he�d snap me out of it, which, hey, why not? Drugs haven�t worked, psychotherapy didn�t work, drugs and psychotherapy didn�t work, naturopathic medicine might have worked if I had have kept on the expensive diet and pills the guy had me on, perhaps it is a matter of selling satellites to sooth the soul. It reminds me of a story that Tom Robbins told in one of his books; I think it was Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates. Anyways, the story goes thusly; an Anthropologist goes to a small tribal community somewhere in the vast Third World. The natives liked him so much, they gave him a gift; Invisibility powder. The Anthropologist kept the powder on his mantelpiece; he never even tried it. The impression the author gave was that the guy was an idiot for not trying the powder. I�m inclined to agree. Sure, one could say that the powder probably wouldn�t work. But what if it did? It doesn�t make sense to me not to try a freely given miracle.   It is now 7.15pm. I cleaned the house, clipped puppy and dog nails, and now I�m here, and this is the extent of my excitement.Ever have the sort of day/week/month/year(s) where you feel like King Claudius? Let me refresh your memory. Claudius was the not-nice new king of Denmark, the cause of something rotten, as Hamlet always complained. Claudius killed his brother, married his sister-in-law, and alienated his new stepson, who hated him way before Daddy Spook came back and told him that Claudius slipped something poisonous in to the ex-king�s ear.   Why might someone feel like Claudius? Well, see, now, Hamlet is all bent on revenge, although he has a procrastination problem to get over. Hamlet sneaks up on Claudius as Claudius is praying. Hamlet thinks �Hey, can�t kill him now, if he�s sitting there repenting, I just bought him a ticket to Heaven, and we just can�t have that.� Thing is though, Claudius isn�t repenting. He�s on his knees, he�s asking for forgiveness, but in a real half-assed way; he doesn�t want to give up what he rightfully stolen. He feels bad for killing his brother, and stealing the kingdom, and what not, but he can�t feel truly repentant, since he really enjoys his current position.   The other day Kurt mentioned to me that it baffles him that I am in a job where, conceivably, I can make as much money as I want, and I don�t. Make as much money as I want, that is. Why?   I get discouraged quickly; I mean we�re talking faster than a speeding bullet. It takes two people to slam the door in my face to ruin my day. Or about three snotty hang ups when I�m calling. So there�s that. There�s also the sneaking suspicion that I�m selling something that does nothing for anybody, some people I sell to could use the money to buy their kids a haircut or some groceries. I�m right behind cigarette sellers, I�m not selling anything useful, nice, etc. Ignorance is bliss, so by that rationale, I guess you can say I�m making people happy, that is until they call me and complain that their remote is too complicated, the installer didn�t come when he said he would, satellite or no, there�s still nothing on TV. And another thing? I can go out all fricken day, get doors slammed, for eight hours straight, and not sell a single, blessed thing. I sit on my ass and make two phone calls, and boom; I sold two systems in 26 minutes.   Why don�t I go out there every single day and spend the full eight hours freezing my ass off and then go home and call for a few more hours? Why do I ask Kurt to come with me, drive me over to subdivisions, and come in with me to help me close a sale? I mean, I know part of it has to do with the fact that I can�t function properly on 3 hours sleep and half a day crying. I know that bit, but then there�s the other bit, the deep seated thought that I am lazy, because I don�t give a rat�s ass about how many dishes I sell so long as I sell some, and I don�t care how much money I make as long as we�re not starving to death.  I haven�t even got my shit together enough to bring my resume down to the bakery.  How does this tie in to Claudius? I have been doing stupid things, and although I�m sorry for them, I�m not doing much to make amends. To sum up, I give up too easily, I look to Kurt for support much more often than I should, I let myself get sad over this and other stupid things, further impeding my progress as a good salesperson, and I feel that selling dishes to a lot of people who could be using their money for something productive (yeah, I know I�m being a self righteous pig, but damn, there are more things important than 266 channels in digital, right? Anybody? Like making sure you don�t have lice and passing it along to some traveling sales rep�)  The landlady came in and asked why our apartment stank today. She happened to be standing by the kitty litter, but for some reason, I not only take personal offence at the remark, but also started to worry about the possibility of her and he husband deciding out we get because of our animals. (Right now we�re at three, Einstein is on the missing list for the last three days, we have our lovely fat Fida, Lucas, and Cordy, who the landlady thinks we�re fostering, when in truth, we�re pretty sure that Cordy would die, then I would if we were to part with her. She�s a pain in the ass, but I know what happens to dogs that aren�t puppies in the SPCA, and she makes up for all of her faults; not to mention her faults are improving.)  It seems to me when I have something to rely on; Kurt, my parents, etc, I rely on them too much. I think I have to not rely on them in order to keep myself going, but then I end up collapsing, and have to rely on them anyways.  And Kurt told me that his coming to school was a mistake. He�s probably right, but at the same time, I wonder if there ever would have been a good and right time for him to go to school. I sort of think excuses would happen, and he�d never go, and he�d be lost to what he truly excels at. But I also know that I�m not sure I have the ability to support us; I mean, I�m doing a pretty shitty job so far, and as soon as I really, really go the distance, I end up on my face.Met my new partner in the Biz, she�s awesome. She�s twenty, wears too much makeup, has beautiful blond hair, has higher blood pressure than her 55 year old dad, sarcastic, witty, and ambitious. Wow. She has her own car. She parties on the weekends, but not during the week. She gets laryngitis five times a year. She�s really cool, a definite improvement over Sad Bastard. SB is interested in hockey, getting drunk, and generally spends his time moping about his sales stats. He had the effect of making me feel guilty every time I made a sale. I noticed I�m susceptible to other people�s moods, so, being with SB didn�t help me in any way, shape, or form. This new girl, let�s call her Pink, has this amazing balance between wanting to sell a lot of dishes, and not letting the garbage part bother her. (Already, SB tried to make her look bad by telling the rest of us that she was a big bullshitter. This might have some thing to do with the fact that she already sold in one week more than he did his first month.)  Yesterday was spent with Pink, getting lost, and looking for a subdivision or a trailer park; somewhere we didn�t have to walk all that far to get from place to place. It was basically a pooch of a day, since neither of us knew the area we were trying to cover. Today, there was a fairly annoying amount of snow, so I turned to the phoning aspect of the job, and may just go out this evening, depending on how some call backs go.  Kurt is off visiting with his new mentor, the University Chaplain. The UC is the guy that set us up with the free food, and he is truly an amazing fellow. When I look at a picture of the Dalai Lama, or the current Pope, I always smile. They look genuinely happy and peaceful. The UC gives off this impression as well, only it�s a little more powerful because he�s live and in color, as opposed to a glossy print. It really does seem to me that this time in this town, I�m finally carving a niche. I felt pretty groundless when I went to school here, nothing made sense, I had no goals, I felt like a stranger. This time around I�m more comfortable. My goals are modest (keep apartment, keep the family fed, try to maintain saneness, get published) but they�re actual goals, not just vague ideas.Good morning,  This is actually instalment two of the day, alas, first post was lost. Usually, I write the whole thing in Word, then paste it into Blogger. I broke with tradition today, and paid the price, words were lost. Bloody hell. Well, not like there was anything stunning on the first post, but jeez�  Went to the market of fleas yesterday. There were no spittling patrons, no loudmouths, and happily sold four dishes. Kurt made a killing on the cards, as well, so we actually came out of it on top, rather than a few bucks in a the hole, as such is often the case.  I think I�m getting better, leastwise my endurance is going up. Yesterday I plummeted after all the salient items were done, I was able to eat a little more than usual. I still fee like liquid hell is sloshing around my cranial cavity, and only Zod knows what�s lurking in the digestive tract, but my capacity to deal has increased.   Yup yup. If anything exciting happens today, I�ll be sure to write about it.A year ago I was a nanny in the City. There were two children, a seven year old and a five year old. They played Grand Theft Auto on the playstation. The youngest kid refused to use  "I", it was "Me want this, Me no like that." The older kid tried to go home with his friends when I came to pick him up at school. The daddy of the the kids put the moves on me, and the mom paid me once, for two days, although I worked for her for close to two months, 12 hours a day. Went to the Labour Board about wages not paid, and it looks like they're going to close my case, because they moved. A lot. At night. With a lot of unpaid bills. For example, they owe a day-care center tab of about four grand. They owe me about 1200, and it looks like I'm not going to see it, unless I can come up with where they're at before April. Bloody hell.  In other news, might go back to busking to bring in some extra dough, but have fallen short of putting up the posters. The vim is gone, the desire to peddle the trade is gone. Need the cash, though, but I wonder if I still have the skill necessary to busk.  Blegghhhh. I'm in a funk. Funky funkmeister of the funky planet funkfunkfunk. Haven't been writing.. Whaton earth do i write about?  Ugh. I'm going to take a bath.that farking link is this: http://villagevoice.com/alertrd.php3?article=41487Go here:  urlLink    This is to pre-empt yet another stupid internet rumor that's probably going to gain in popularity in the weeks to come. I'm not even going to dignify this piece of crappy reporting by quoting it here. The link is to my favorite advice columnist, Dan Savage. Dan is as queer as a three dollar bill, pulls no punches when offering sexual advice to the masses, and is a generally entertaining read. Of course, this issue is begging me to get on the subject of sexual orientation, so excuse me while i indulge myself on a rant here: I've come across a lot of gay folks in my day. A lot. University is the prime place to be questioning one's sexuality, along with everything else. University students have a tendancy to question everything; to try and figure out where they fit. Understandable, but common sense should come up and rattle these people a bit. I truly wholeheartedly believe that one's sexual orientation is NOT a choice, but there are a lot of fucked-up post teens who give it a go in the university scene. In this morass of stupid descisions, there are the folks who feel they just have to stand up and face the music, who have to admit that they are, in fact, gay, and that they're trying to get on wit their lives the best way they can. Good for them. My beef is the promiscuity issue. Promiscuity is wrong, and it's going to hurt people. A few of my guy friends who came out became sluts. There isn't a thing called safe sex, you're putting a piece of latex or sheepskin or whatever between yourself and a disease that will not only kill you, but probably make a lot of other people sick before you even realise you have it, and you're spreading it around.    Promiscuity is everywhere, not just in the gay side of things. Sex is used as a weapon, for power, for everything. I could have sold a lot more dishes with just the hint of sex, showing off my body, being flirtatious. Back home in Hick City, a guy's status is greatly elevated according to how many girls he's been with. (This only goes one way, girls are not cool by having multiple partners.) I had shocked and amazed people by stating that I would not date a particular fellow because he had been with too many girls. In university, a lot less had changed than I would have liked. Jocks at my school were supplied with bunnies who wanted them. The more bunnies they had, the more bunnies wanted them.  I'm of the mind that homosexuality, in and of itself is no more evil than any other thing. We're all sinners, right? It's the choices one makes that make it evil, or not. Be gay, be straight, be whatever your little heart desires, but be monogamous.Fida is sans uterus, and I just took one in the ass to refain from pregnancy; feels like I've been hit with something large and heavy. I can't help but wonder, since my attention has been put to all manner of things reproductive, why is it that the female of our species gets new and unique forms of mild torture known as birth control? I ask merely for information, I'm not overtly bitter or anything. But my common sense tells me "Hey. Boys' plumbing and chemistry is a lot easier to manage, so why not manage birth control?" Right now is probably not the best time to be speculating as my ass hurts, the drug is working though my system like a toxic molasses...on the upside NO PERIODS. None. Ingenius. Swelling, pain and dripping like a faucet is not a terrifc way to spend eight or so days a month. There's just no need.  Anyways. Mostly ignored the superbowl yesterday. I mean, I probably would have paid more attention if the first three quarters didn't suck, but there you go. I wanted good ol' Jerry Rice to be the only player to win three superboals on three seperate teams, but alas, poor Jerry, your team's heads were firmly stuck in the astro turf.  Age Of Mythology has a huge hold over my psyche. That game is more addictive than crack. I even dream about all my little Greeks running around, getting resources.   Sending mojo did not work for Chad. Miss Complicated accepted a written invitation to go to a romantic resturant, and then, at the end of the night, told Chad that his expectations were too high, and that he was putting undue pressure on her. I assume she accepted the invitation, (complete with romantic quasi-poem) to gain a free meal, the silly bint.   I saw, at the vet's today, that a dog named Bear needs a home. She's small, an exotic aussieshepard crossed with something equally exciting, and she's going to be 2 in Feburary. What do I do? (Besides, of course, hunt down and kill the bastard who hit her.) I  feel like I don't deserve any pets after what happened with Cordy. (Lucas isn't a pet, he's my first husband.) Fida I watch and worry over as if she's my kid, and she's got a terminal case. Would it be good for us to get another dog? Would it be, more importantly, good for Bear to come here and live with us?  Ok. Off I go, to build and destroy things.Went to  a friend, Granger's birthday party last night, and hada great time.   This is a peculiar state of affairs, as I normally don't being in public in general and bars in particular. But thanks to amazing company, and a moderate amount of beer, a good time was definitely had. And Granger is definitely Miz Popularity, she seemed very happy that her friends were around.   Landlord dropped by today, fixed the lock on the door, and informed us that the fuck downstairs is moving soon. Good for us, good for the neighbourhood kitties, this guy's a kicker. His wife seems fabulous, but I was too afraid to get to know her.   Much mojo goes to Chad today, as he makes another attempt at being with a girl he loves but is a huge pain in the ass. She's a smoker that's into natural healing, and yeah, that's basically how she is about everything, it seems. Complicated.   Found out what type of writer i want to be. I read a bit of WP Kinsella, and that's it. That's what i want, to bring magic into the every day, to invoke a sense of wonder about the world. WP brought us the only Kevin Costner movie I ever liked; "Field of Dreams". I'm not a baseball fan, and I think Kevin ought to be tied up and smacked with VHS copies of all the movies he's ever made, "waterworld' is worth five hits, same goes with 'the postman'. Ugh. That guy acts with all the passion of a phone book. Anyways, it's based on a short story called "Shoeless Joe Jackson Comes to Iowa'. Read that, and  a few others, and Mr. Kinsella is my new favorite author, ousting John Irving.  All right, so this blog entry sucks ass. But I'm back.ps- did not mean to come off as a snotty bitch in the last post...I love you all, call if you like. I'm thankful for each of you. Just not a stunning conversationalist at present.I got a job, unfortunately, it begins in March, three kids, all roughly of school age, they're  the intospective type,  also big on building and destroying things. Tomorrow, I eat lunch with the boys and their parents as a sort of orientation thing. I'm not looking forward to it, not because of the kids, or the drive, but Cordy.  I know life should continue, and will continue, whether I want it to or not,and maybe, according to some lifeless, souless bastards, a person can think about this obejectively and say 'Hey, it's only a dog," but I am emphatically not one of those people, and the profound lack of Cordy is a weight, a tear on my insides, and an ache on my head and heart. She was much too alive to be dead. I keep on thinking about whether or not she was in pain, whether she knew we were with her, if she was scared, I worry about that a lot, about many deaths; I think there can't be anything worse than dying scared. And, I keep wondering if things were Enough, did we do enough for her? Surely she didn't live enough. Did she eat enough, was she happy enough? Were we good enough for her? To her?  I know she would have been a water dog. She would have jumped with reckless abandon into streams and lakes; she would have jumped all over us with her damp lean body. She would have done many things, and I simply can not express how much I miss her, how much I want to see her ears finally stand up, to see her get another pre-growth spurt fat belly. So many things.  I sort of think that if I get over this, it will mean that I'm not sorry anymore, that I am not admitting my negligence. I know, deep down, that this is a lie, and it's virtually impossible to entirely get over something the way I feel I will, and, also, it's  utterly impossible for time to stop. Because of time, everything passes.   It is possible that i may stop writing new blogs for a while. Until this is over. If that's going to happen, I'm going to put pieces of crap I've been writing the last while on, so that way, you all know I've not found something sharp. (seriously, no threat, no worry of me damaging myself, there's no way i could do that to my family, and to kurt, so please, no concerned phone calls.)  Do you think she would have traded her life with us for something longer?Cordy   September 11, 2002 � January 17, 2003   She died about an hour ago. We had been training her to go outside unattended, but today Kurt had caught her on the road. Neither of us was paying attention when it happened; even after yelling at her about it today. The fucks that hit her didn�t stop. I think she was struck in the head. It�s funny, all those years of pre-hospital care, I was trained not to move a victim, but it wasn�t her spine that was the problem. Her eyes didn�t track when we got her inside. I kept thinking that we never took a picture of her. Not one.  She was a terror, Cordy was. She gave us fleas, she peed in our bed, she ate underwear, and she ate George, my bear who was dressed as an engineer, who sat with his arms in a loop around his knees. She ate his nose first, of course, and followed up with his eyes. She had a thing for chewing tacks, and if the ghost poo story is not to be believed, she had heroic sized bowels. She loved the shower; she�d try to get into it whenever some one was in there, sometimes, however, she was content to squint as the spray from the shower hit her in the face.  She was goofy looking, beautiful, and occasionally, one of her ears would make an attempt to stand up straight. This month, she finally grew into her head. There�s so much more to write about her, really, but I can�t.    She tried to beat up the shop vac, cats were her best friends. Lucas even liked her, eventually.  We both miss her so much already, we hardly know what to do with ourselves.Damn it.  That job, the one i was excited about, the one i asked for mojo to get is not an option. In order to get this job, a person has to be in receipt of EI benefits in the last 5 years. I've never been on pogey, so this disqualifies me immediately. The sad and horrid thing is that this is a trap. It's designed to be part of a program that gets folks off EI. However, the job placement lasts a mere 48 weeks, and those 48 weeks are not insurable; meaning that those weeks cannot be counted towards future EI benefits.   So, my word of the day is FUCK. Also, I called Mr. Freake's office. I am one of eighty applicants.   BUT, i do have a job interview as a nanny on Thursday at 4.00pm. It's minimum wage, which is about 6 bucks here, but it's also 40 hours a week, it's kids, and hey, it may be all right. Also, the lady from the Real Good Job wants to meet me anyways, so something may happen with that yet.The cat, Fida, goes haywire every night at about three fifteen. She tears around the house, tries to open up doors, and generally makes as much noise as felinely possible. i know this because not only has she woken me up, but the last few days, three am is when I got up.   My big plan for the week is to make a huge pot of stew for some superfriends that live about. I'm still in job limbo, sometimes paralysed with fear that I'm not going to get a job, as matter of fact, the thought has crossed my mind that Kurt and the animals and I will be living out of the civic come march. Oy.  I want that assistant job so badly I can taste it. I went to the church monday to show my face, and meet some salient people. Unfortunately, the person will be hired by a board, (2 by 4) so there was no one to introduce myself to. I'm phoning today to find out if The Powers That Be got my application ok. Please send much mojo, good vibes, prayers, and all that my way, I need this job, and I'd be GOOD at it. (Namely, I'd be doing research on the internet to find ways to fund charity programs, and being the plan co-ordinator's lackey.) Also, if there are any ideas on how to get this job, any little hints, let me know.  Also applied to be an admin assistant to an accountant. The man's name is unfortunate: Ian A. Freake. Mr. Freake. You've got to like that.   I haven't written a single solitary creative thing since...since...wow. A long time. Last thing I was working on I shut down because it was about Kali, and me being the ignorant fark that i am, didn't realise that kali worship is alive and well. Sure, i could modify it comepletely, but I've not had the engine to do anything of the sort in a long while. Then, there was a kid's story about a little girl who wants to be a fly on the wall, but again, the creative juices have slowed and thickened. Could be a winter thing, I suppose.Woke up about an hour ago, I think sleeping is righting itself in a proper way, slowly, but it's happening. I woke up after a dream I had about the ocean. I'm always dreaming about the ocean, lots of different ocean themes cross over my sleepy mind. This one, a set of large waves were coming in, and an extremely foolish woman was trying to ride her horse out into the surf. The swells were increasing, the horse would drown soon, I knew. I swam up to her, and tried to talk her out of what she was planning. She couldn't hear me, and in the fashion of many of my dreams, I talked to the horse. I told it how to swim under the waves as they crash, how it's important not to panic, and I told it I would go with it where ever it went, to help it swim. The horse got me to cover its nostrils as a wave began to break, it told me how hard it was to carry the foolish woman. The horse and I formulated a plan, it swam along the shoreline, rembering to duck under as the waves came, and to wait for them to pass before emerging for a breath. I swam alongside, out of sight from the rider, and timed it so when a wave was just about to crash over top of the horse and rider, I surfed it, and grabbed the rider, and pulled her off the horse, using the force of the ocean to acomplish this. The horse, now riderless, made its way inshore. As the rider and I got pulled into shore, I punched her in the face a few times, my dream self remembering Kurt telling me how a knockout is really only a case of whiplash. I knocked her out, pulled her away from the surf. The horse was standing on top of a dune, and I took off its bridle, halter, saddle. It galloped away, assuring me it would never get caught again. I turned back to the ocean to see the waves growing in size, and lessening in frequency. Perfect, thought my dream self, and I went back in to surf the waves.  It's peculiar. I feel I should be angry about something. I'm not exactly one to get angry, I get annoyed, and it's safe to say I get annoyed frequently, and in this state I'm most verbose about what exactly it is that's annoying me. But anger is something completely different, something one should be serious about, and life is much too important to be taken seriously. But right now, I feel I should be angry about something, there should be a righteous ire building in me, but it seems to me I must have forgotten what it was I was supposed to be angry about. I suppose I'm angry with the Rider from my dream, I'm angry at Garp for not being more understanding towards Helen in the book I'm reading. I keep on thinking about conversations Kurt and I have about where women stand in society (It's far worse than most would even suspect, and the scary thing is that it's practically invisible). I am angry at the fact that women are rarely taken as authorities on anything, how an assertive woman is a bitch, an open woman needy, and how, two years ago, a white, upper middle class woman, complained to the class i was in that she was being oppressed because there were too many men in her electrian's class, and she had to 'settle' for University. (wear a burqua, bitch, then talk to me about being oppressed. Don't get me wrong, women are not on par with men anywhere on this flavored little planet, but opression is not the proper term to use when talking about too many men in one place.)  But this anger is cerebral, distant and off to the side. I feel, oddly enough, that is should be closer to me, I should take the plight of the poor, women, and the other injustices to heart and become passionate with anger, and jump up and do something about the State of Things. I won't though. The more pragmatic side says that life does, in fact, suck, and getting angry does nothing. Nothing. It's a useless emotion, in and of itself, and there are many ways one can make their own corner of the world better. Feeling a duty to help people out, to be compassionate, I think that's the better way to go about things. Getting angry and distributing leaflets and other things will not change matters. Helping your neighbour out does. In a tiny way, of course, but everything's made up of tiny things, right?And so i got this e-mail today from zee Boss:  Robyn   It has been 11 days since you have been back and have yet to return any calls of mine. I'm sorry but I think its time to move on and find someone else that wants the job that will be able to sell everyday. I have called you at least 7 times in the new year and have not heard from you at all.   I was a patient as possible and tried in everyway to help you along, I hope that you will find something that will be better for you.   Boss Man   Ok...had i got this a week ago, or for that matter, yesterday, I would have been devestated. (If it had have been the last few days, I probably would yammied all over the keyboard.) I mean, it's not snotty, but i definitely felt like i threw it all away. Not now. I feel like i made the right choice, underlined by the feeling of whoo i'm free...Freeeeeeeeeee..free to run down to the Baptist church the next town over and explain to them thatI would love to be a an adminstrative assistant to the Family Resource center. (I really would!) Of course, my dear Avid Reader, you may be thinking I'm off my gourd. Not so. The bills are taken care of till about Feburary. So, i have time. I hope it's enough time. I am aware it was perhaps idiotic to leave one job without having another one to run to, but it was to the point where i could not physically go to work. Nausea, wanting to drive the car off something or into something, a plethora of ill feelings and fears, not to mention my penchant for focusing on the negative; all of these things aided me in that helpless horrid feeling of my sanity unraveling. And, I feel I'm just putting my trust out There, and that makes me feel ok. Weird, right? I did a stupid thing, and I feel ok, becuase I'm trusting that I can find a better job, that i can do better then selling dishes. And I can do it before the safety net goes out. So, send mojo and happy thoughts my way.This is a graphic article. Be aware.  My sleep schedule is still cockeyed, but a couple days ago, I did the dishes, shampooed the carpet, vacuumed, did the laundry, and made supper. I was feeling more or less on the ball. Suddenly, I vomited supper, and spent the rest of the night and most of the morning puking. After that stopped, the muscle aches and the general feeling of �hoo boy, am I siiiiicccck� took over. And here I am, nauseated, ate three chocolate chip waffles very, very slowly, and that has been my sustenance for the last 72 hours. This morning, I was not able to keep down water. But, that was ok, when I puke water, it just takes like water; hardly any stomach acid gets in. My dad used to recommend eating bananas when I had the stomach flu, because �The taste as good coming up as they do going down.� This, by the way, is not entirely true, but if you have to eat something in between visits to the toilet, banana is pretty easy to handle, unlike tuna cassaerole. I don�t  think I�ll be able to eat that again for a long, long time.  So, I found out today, I haven�t been fired, not yet. I have to tell boss man my intentions today. Might still get fired, I suppose, but it�s nice to know I have a chance, if I need it, to keep my job. I hate it. I�ve listed the reasons why, but I need a job.   And then, I thought. Fuck it, Fuck boss man, and fuck everything to do with the company. I want to work for a non-PROFIT organisation. Lo and Behold, I found something; an ad to become an �administrative assistant� at a local family resource center. I�m getting this job.Boss, Here's the thing, I've been out of commsion since i got back from home. I flipped my sleep schedule over, so i can't sleep at night, and i've been nausated. Anyways, that's not an excuse, it's a reason. I'm doing the best I can, and I would like to continue to work for you. Thanks.  robyn   So, i can't summon the cajones to either call Boss man, or to face him in person. This email, is not a lie, not exactly. It is a lie of omission. The reason I've been ill IS the job. I omitted that I hate my job, want out of the job so badly i can almost taste it, and would rather be shovelling rhino poop than working for him. The company billed me for 135 extra dollars, they took it out of my account, and I can't get that back into my account, but they can credit me.   Kurt's back in classes,and I'm hoping to win the hearts and minds of the good people at the town office. The powers of the town are putting together a program where folks can help out younger kids by helping them into the workforce. It even includes drving them to places. I would like this job because the pay is steady, it sounds at LEAST passingly meaningful, and I would really, really like to be involved in something that could help another body out. It's right in Wolfville, and one uses the company car. I'm actually worried about getting my hopes up, seems whenever I do things don't work out. Send mojo for me, kids, I need a job that won't lead me to homicide.  A few days ago, I noticed the apartment is slightly barren. I got drawing stuff today, I'm hoping that will change some things.I have writer�s block, or so it would seem. Here is a transcript of the most exciting thing that happened today. Mollusk was my msn name of the day, the Angry Mallard is Jace, the guy that guest spotted here, and has his own damn blog, of which you can read if you go here:  ragingquack.blogspot.com  The Angry Mallard says: robynism! Mollusk says: g'day..  The Angry Mallard says: wussup? Mollusk says: writer's block, cried durning futurama, don't want to talk to my boss The Angry Mallard says: cried? Mollusk says: besides that, okey dokey Mollusk says: YUP.. sad, eh? Mollusk says: did you see it today? The Angry Mallard says: what about The Angry Mallard says: nope Mollusk says: Well, Frye's dog was found, and it was encased in something or other, so he was going to bring the dog back to life. The Angry Mallard says: uhhuh Mollusk says: finds out that the dog has lived 12 years after he was frozen... Mollusk says: so he decided not to bring him back to life because it was likely the dog forgot all about him. Mollusk says: Then, it goes to a scene where you see what happened to the dog for those twelve years Mollusk says: the dog waits there.  Mollusk says: and waits, and waits. Mollusk says: and dies Mollusk says: so, i cried. The Angry Mallard says: (insert crying smiley graphic here)      That�s it, seriously, the most interesting thing was that I talked to Jacen, and I discovered that I have a very soft heart (or head, perhaps?) I do have somewhat of a track record regarding movies. I cried during the original black and white production of �The Hunchback of Notre Dame�, as my Dad will attest. I was furious with that gypsy strumpet running of with Blond guy, when it was the hunchback who loved her, and who had saved her life. I was five at the time, and remember balling my fists, and biting my lip, and realizing that life sucks, better get a helmet. (K maybe not that last bit, I was five, after all.) After that, I never cried during a movie until �The Green Mile�.  I don�t think I ever cried during a TV show. Can�t say that anymore I guess. I thought the reason was chemical at first, since, hey, I might�ve skipped a pill, and, in the past, I was typically emotional the night before the first day of my period. However, I�ve not had a period in six months or so, and I didn�t skip the daily dose. So, I guess I�m a softie.  So, I�m reading �Skinny Legs and All� by Tom Robbins. Sometimes, I truly enjoy his work. Other times I want to beat him senseless. Flowery language surrounding bullshit ideas, but there�s just enough compelling, interesting stuff to make me like him, the jerk. Also, he�s a research based writer, which I long to be.   An example of this flowery bullshittyness was a bit I read last night. The gist was that folks who spend too much of their energies on the pursuit of Heaven will put the world through hell. For example, who cares about the environment, suffering of people, etc, when you have a notion that you�re going to Heaven? Consequences be damned; we�re just here for the trial. Real life begins after death.  I agree, to a certain extent, that too much emphasis on Heaven, and more secularly, the future, is a nasty ass place to be. It�s difficult for us, sure, because we can�t even experience the present, because the present is always slipping through our fingers at a steady rate. But, what the fuck Tom? Aren�t YOU sort of pining away at something, sort of like our friends who think too much about the afterlife? Basically, he�s saying things would be better IF. The Heaven/Future oriented are saying the same . Things would be better if we were dead, or older, or richer, or smarter, or skinner, or fatter, or if we didn�t think about the future so much. I guess what I took out of it is that one has to be mindful of right now, what�s going on. I think entirely disregarding the future is just as dangerous. The middle path is advised, which is sort of funny, Gotama Buddha said that something like for thousand years ago. Level headed guy, that.  I am going to work for the Evil today. Really. This is my plan, anyways. Of course, my sleep patterns are back to nocturnal, I hate my job, the boss, and everything else, and I have two visits to make for new potential employers. Right.  And for the daily does of positivity : There is a LOT of snow on the ground, and it is beautiful. Also, Magic is awesome.   Dorks rule.This is a version of the chad-sex-in-the-office story.	  The Confession  I�m always in the office in the afternoon. Pat, my advisor, was usually out, so it�s the best time to get work done. The creepy exchange down the hall, Juanita, is two offices down. She always sits in the dark, walking into her office is like walking into a cave. Nonetheless, into the cave I go, since she left me a note to see her in the faculty mailbox this morning. Probably wants to talk about my thesis. Almost every prof has, at some time, or another, wanted to talk to me about the thesis. It�s the first time that the Department has allowed for a thesis in English to be a creative project. 	So into the cave I go. She appears to be meditating, or napping. I knock on her door, she gestures for me to sit down. In my head, I go over what I had written so far on my thesis, about playing hockey, missing my ride because of drugs, the standoff I had with mom about the drugs. Right now, I�m writing about how my mom locked me in the basement to get me clean. So, I�m sort of grinning when I sit down, in part because of Juanita�s imperious gesture, but largely remembering how much my mom loved me to lock me in that basement, while I was screaming obscenities. 	I sit, waiting for her to start. Juanita sighs, flips back her long brown hair. She sighs again, and adjusts her glasses. I can�t help but think how weird she is, sitting in her cave, and not actually speaking to me. 	�You know, Charles, there have been a number of sexual assaults on campus the past through months.� My brain brings up solid. She has an accent, she�s from Venezuela, or somewhere else warm and Spanish speaking. Maybe I misheard.	 	�What?� 	�Sexual assaults.� She sighs again, leans back. Okay. I understood what she said. Why is she saying it to me? 	�I�m sorry, Juanita, but what are we discussing here? I thought we were going to discuss my thesis,� My mouth is quite dry, and my brain, after slamming into that mental wall, is scrabbling to make sense out of what she�s saying. 	�Well, Charles, I wish we could talk about your thesis, but this is far more serious. I see a girl hanging around the office with you sometimes, yes?� A girl. A girl. A girl. Jocelyn  works out of town, she never comes to see me at the office. She calls, to find out what we�re doing that evening. Classmates. A girl. Then it hits me.  	�A short girl, short blond hair? Reece?� 	�Yes, that would be her. I do not know her name.� 	�Yes, well, what about her? Wait a minute. What is being implied here?� 	�Charles, I spend many hours in this office, often late at night. I would prefer it if you did not bring girls to your office to have sex with them.� She�s leaning forward now. I�m trying really hard not to laugh, or puke on her desk. 	�What?� I say eloquently. It�s like what I hear about looking into the Grand Canyon, at first, a person�s brain is unable to process it, it�s too damn deep. This was difficult to process because it was too damn insane. 	�Why are you surprise Charles?� 	�Juanita, I am not having sex in my office. Or are you saying I assaulted her? What are you trying to say? She�s not even my girlfriend,� She raises a hand. 	�It is none of my business. I do find it unprofessional, however.� 	� Wait a minute. Wait one minute. Reece is my best friend. We play video games here. No sex. I have a fianc�e, and we live together.� She�s getting a bit uncomfortable now, probably has to do with the fact that I�m bewildered, and the bewilderment is making me sound high pitched and crazy. 	�Whatever you say, Charles. Just keep what I say in mind.� I stand up, walk out of her cave, hitting the doorframe with my shoulder on the way out. Then I call Reece, and tell her everything. The same crazy I heard in me, I heard in her. 	�Chazz, you can�t be serious? What the hell? Oh my God, Chazz, could this affect getting into grad schools next year?� 	I sigh. �I hadn�t even thought about that. But if Juanita goes to the head of the department, yeah, this could mean something bad.� 	�All right, fine. I�m going to see her tomorrow.� The next day passes, with me getting chills every time I pass that creepy woman�s office. At 4pm, almost on the nose, Reece walks in. She�s carrying a case of beer.  	�Drinks on me, lover boy.� Despite the tone, she looks nervous. Weirded out. 	�Don�t screw with me, what happened?� She grinned, sort of tightly around the corners. �I told her everything. She was taken pretty far aback. I started in on the whole if-she-thought-i-was-being-assaulted-why-the-hell-didn�t-she-call-security thing. She said she was going to, but she was worried about embarrassing us. Embarrassment! Can you imagine?� 	�It would have cleared things up pretty quick if she had.� 	�No kidding. But, it�s over now, anyways.� She�s not looking at me, and she�s looking sort of tense. 	�How?� 	�Like is said, Chazz, I told her everything. I told her that I was worried about your career, that we were playing video games, that nighttime is the best time to do that so we aren�t pissing anyone off. The last thing was the kicker.� She blushed. Reece is not the blushing type, but then again, we really don�t talk about much that would have that potential. 	� And I told her that I was a virgin, and had an appointment to see the doctor this evening to find out if there�s any tests, or whatever I could take to prove it. She got pretty uncomfortable, then, and told me that wouldn�t be necessary. I, uh, well. Here�s some beer.� 	She left then. I was too stunned to give chase. She didn�t answer her phone the next day, but Juanita cornered me in the printing room.   	�You have a very good friend. Not to worry about it, okay? It was my mistake.� I just smiled and nodded, and strangled her in my head. Then I left the office, bought a black forest cake, and went to find Reece.G�day mates,   Here�s the deal. I�ve been thinking, harder than usual, about quitting my job, since its been sucking my soul, and boss guy is a liar. Then there�s the lice, the public, the door knocking, etc. And Boss guy is pretty keen on daily communication, and I�m really not into that. I like to leave work elsewhere, and although it is not your standard 8 hour day, it is six days a week, and I�d like for it to fuck off when I�m not doing it. Right. Also, it is depressing to sell dishes to folks who need to buy their kids beds, rather than 274 channels. My first day of work, for example, (and I know, you�ve heard it thirty times) I sold a dish to a schizophrenic lady without a TV. And Boss told me he was proud.   So I talked to my parents, and my parents had an interesting take on it. Since I don�t care to be working for him, but need to find a new job, it�s time to stop caring, have fun with it, and act as though I had nothing left to lose. If he fires me, so be it, if not, buys me more time to looking for a job I don�t feel ashamed of having.  An Ode to Chad  I first met Chad at RA camp. All the people there had to toss their shoes into a pile, then the organizer separated the shoes into piles. My shoe was next to Chad�s. Clearly, we were a match made in Heaven. So we ended up in the same group, then we became partners for this annoying training game where you and your partner had to disclose embarrassing details about yourself. I learned he was sort of afraid of heights, he discovered I was dating a guy 11 years older than me. At the RA party, before the rest of the university students came, he looked at me and said �You know, sometimes, you look really sad. Sometime, I would like to know what makes you sad. If you ever need to talk, let me know.� Somewhere during that year, when I was busy cutting my hair to nil length and trying to avoid killing myself, Chad and I became friends. We were the uncouple, going to places with real couples, going out to bars together, talking on the phone ad nauseam, and driving, on his motorcycle, his car, the bus, whatever. There was also the Tim Horton�s/French prostitute ritual, and lots of hopeless chats about how mentally ill people shouldn�t date. The next year, we got accused of having sex in Chad�s office (wrote a story about that, will post after), he wrote his thesis, and basically, hilarity ensued. When I got engaged, he was happy for me.  I am lucky, or perhaps blessed, to have a friend that can talk about how to kill people, enjoys watching superman, and plays You don�t Know Jack, even though he regularly gets his ass booted all around the place.   I remember going through phases of understanding Chad. At first, I thought he was conceited. Then, I thought he wasn�t, he just pretending to be conceited to be funny. Then, I realised, he�s conceited, pretends to be not conceited, by taking his conceitedness to an extraordinary degree. Side note: He thinks it�s funny.  So here�s another happy fuzzy, you big geek. Now go burn Age of Mythology for me, or black and white two.I think I may have had the world�s best poutine last night. (Not the curds kind, the wimpy gravy and mozzerella kind.) Kurt and I had planned to go to a pub or some such for supper, alas, it being a holiday and all, there were few culinary choices. We went to this pizza place I dimly remembered from being a student. It was like finding a ten dollar bill in a jacket pocket; the food was amazing.   Saw The Two Towers a few nights ago. It pretty much knocked my socks off. I admit, though, I�m an anal retentive ass when it comes to movies about books I love. The Fellowship was great, but there were a few points about the movie that drove me nuts. Pippin and Mery were idiots in the first movie, unfair, considering that those two figured out Frodo�s secret in the book. I know the movie needed comic relief, as it was intense, but they could have used the relationship between Gimli and Legolas, like the did in the second, instead of making Pippin and Merry clueless dorks. But, on the other side of things, I�m glad Sam wasn�t a big old tard, which was the case in the cartoon adaptation. (If you haven�t seen that, by the way, go find it. It�s not the goofy Hobbit with crappy animation, but the one entitled Lord of the Rings. I�m pretty sure Peter Jackson took a few things from that movie. (Not a bad thing.)  I was told tonight by the Traveller that folks around home have been worried about the money situation. Odd how that�s comforting. (they care, they like me�) I�m not going to say that the money situation is all cleared up, but we are now caught up with rent, the phone bill, Kurt�s Alberta health care; and coming soon; the power and the wedding rings. I suppose right now my only real worry is the job. I hate it. I dislike working with my-co-workers, I caught god damned LICE,  and although my job is somewhat limitless with how much money I could make, it�s also floorless, giving no room for illness, or fatigue. And, boss man lied, told me initially that there would be no cold calling; that someone would be making appointments for me, and that they didn�t do any of that door-to-door shit�.The Ghost in the Cabin  All right, so Kurt went to sleep one night (morning) at 5am. Our Cordy is not one hundred percent housebroken, so there was a few poos on the loose. Kurt and I have often marvelled how such large poo can come out of such an eensy anus, but this is one of the mysteries Cordy holds. Kurt cleaned the couple o�poo, and he fell asleep. I awoke at eight, and let the dogs out to do their dirty deeds outdoors, they happily went out, and little Cordy had another hero-sized poo. Back to sleep went I, and awoke again around 11am. In that space, of a mere 3 hours, there were eight poos strewn about the hallway, strategically placed so, if Sis woke up and had to relieve her own bowels, she would be quite literally full of shit. I made a move to clean the poo, but Herr Gag reflex implored me to get assistance. I woke a semi-grumpy Kurt up to clean, and I let zee dogs out again. Kurt attested that there was more than one animal pooping on the floor in those three hours; could Lucas have regressed? I considered this point and deemed it unlikely, since Lucas is too prissy to even go outside when it�s raining, let alone crap in his own personal space (unless, of course, he were ill, or desperately seeking revenge.) As Kurt was cleaning the poo, getting more and more frustrated, I noticed that there was yet another poo that I had previously not spied, I warned him too late as he stepped backwards in some mess. I had not seen this poo before. I dropped my glance downwards, and there was a menacing poo at my feet, previously unnoticed. I was lucky enough not to step in it, and I heard Kurt groan as he flattened another poop. To bring this up to speed; there were now 11poos where previously eight questioned my stomach�s tenacity.  I counted. It was daylight. Another note; Cordy had not eaten since the night before. And she pooped approximately 13 times in 7 hours? The thought would be that this was a Diearrea sort of poo, but nope. These poos, were firm, human sized, and not the greasy smear that diaherrtic doggie poo usually announces itself. (K, so spell checker cacked when I tried to spell the poo word that begins with D�spelling suggestions, anyone?) All of the sudden, as I stared at the poop at my feet, I realised that this situation was entirely ridiculous. Insane. Unreal. And then, I had an epiphany; like someone had lifted the veil on the mystery of the poo. It was the fricken HOUSE pooing! A poltergeist with an overactive, corporeal bowel. A bad spirit with equally noxious intestines. Or, simpler; something in the house was changing things around to make frustration the prevailing theme. I mean, we left all the animals, three dogs and a cat alone, on full stomachs for over twelve hours the night previous. We came back to Paul�s where Cordy had eaten some paper, and peed on the floor once. ONCE. Also, as of the last two weeks or so before our holiday excursion, she was asking to go outside when she experienced full intestines. Our problem was that Cordy didn�t seem to get that pee was another bodily function not allowed in the house.  Ghost poo. You read it here first. Thus concludes the tale.    What's your New Year's Resolution? I never have one, leastwise, not one that begins on the New Year. But something I am going to try to do is remember the things that i find important. Intitutively, I would think that by virtue of things being important, I wouldn't forget them. Not so. One thing I�m ashamed of forgetting bit my ass today. The West Memphis Three are still in jail, have been in jail since 1993, and after finding about the case from my dear friend Roger Ebert, I promptly forgot all about it. Forgot that three guys around my age got tossed into jail wrongfully, and are likely to stay there until they die. And I forgot. Well, not this time, though. Go to the web page on these guys. Then, pray for justice for these, and the many others like them.     http://www.wm3.org/The kids of the Family are SICK. We're talking fever, snottiness irritabilty, and a general malaise that wafts throughout the house. The baby, being fussy, slept on me today; he didn't want to go back to his crib. Sitting there, with a feverish, snot ridden baby made me thing about maternal feelings, and whether or not I have them. I think I do, somewhere, I like kids, I espcially like when they're quiet, but they're gross a lot of the time, dirty most of the time, and loud a fair bit of the time. I enjoy kids and babies company overall, but I don't feel an overwhelming urge to cuddle them, pick them up and kiss them or anything, and, emphatically, newborns are not cute. They're weird little wrinkled pink things, more like alien raisins than  fellow human beings. But if I had to choose between being in a room with kids, or adults, kids would win. On the other hand, if it were kids, adults, and animals, animals would win, paws down.  Fricken Kurt needs an indoor voice; waking me up this morning at five am, talking with Jacen the mouth piece. However, he was ridicously happy to talk to Jacen, how could anyone be mad at that? I suppose I could blame Jacen and all his damn talking; but Jacen is the one person I can't seem to ever get mad at. Ever. God knows how he does it.  Reading "The Beauty Myth" by Naomi Wolf right now. It's good, but I refrained from taking it home, as I should moderate myself on reading or watching anything inflamatory. Watching "Bowling for Columbine" pissed me off about the World In General for weeks. "Bitch", well, I still think about "Bitch". What I need are some nice, quality comic books.   Anyways, that's it for now. Remember not to eat snow, and also, evil never wins. Ever.   Jeez, i wonder when the last time i had a shower was?Dreamt an ending to a story I have not written; about topics I never really thought I would ever write about; a serial killer. I'm not going to write the ending here in case it becomes one of those ideas that ferments in my consciousness until I have to write it down. It could be that around the time of dreaming, I was watching too much Law and Order.   Rent's still a sketchy thing; nothing short of a miracle will let us pay it on time. It will get paid, I have no doubt, but not on time. I suppose that doesn't really matter, as long as it does, in fact, get paid, but the sliding by on things is starting to get to me. I know I should not have allowed myself to get fired from The Dish Selling; at the same time I know I would have killed myself before the month was up had I stayed on. All the lying, the driving, the stupid people, the lice, the complaints, I know it wasn't worth it. But, it was decent pay, and that's something we need. I am also feeling a general doubt as to whether I can be a good, happy worker person. I was feeling all right about being a nanny, but it's the little things that get a person, right? I screwed up the molasses cookies last time I was over. They tasted pretty zarking foul. Not a big deal, so why does it feel like a big deal? Does my brain really need to create drama? And the Dad guy..why do I want to poke his beady little eyes out? I've got no concrete reason, other than he thinks animals are useless, and that he makes strikingly idiotic observations, whilst taking the 'I've seen it all stance'. He can't be completely bad guy; the kids love him, and so does the Mommy woman, but everytime I so much as see the guy, my hair hurts, my teeth itch, and pimples start exploding over my face.  I feel like I'm waiting for something.I think I may becoming increasingly more anti-social. Not exactly in the want-to-burn-things-down sort of way, but in the sort of stand-up comedian sort of way; I sort of hate people, they're stupid, and I don't want to interact with them ever. It could be the result of too much pop, and not enough vegetables or something.  Watched The Vigin Suicides again. I love that movie. Love it. Every emotion makes an entrance in that movie, and it is directed like a dream, or a particularily lovely but sad poem. I always feel an immense satisfaction after watching it, although it raises more questions than it answers.  Been thinking about a girl I knew in school a lot lately. Not sure if that means I should call her, or i'm just feeling nostalgic. Think I'll call her anyways. She's not too far from me now, and her sense of the positive is almost a physical thing, she is a person that can and will do things; all manners and sorts of things that are extraordinary, and special. There's another reason too. For the last six months or so, I feel a sense of panic when I think of someone I've not thought of for a while; I think they're dead. I don't think they're dead because we lost contact with one another, just that they've died. Another eccentricity to go one the list, I suppose.Ok.  Kurt is possibly gonig to get about 2 grand from Student Loan, evidently, there was a mixup in our favor. He was also awarded a 2000 dollar bursary Rent is looming, might be able to pay it by using the aforementioned bursary, through the grace of The Powers That Awarded said bursary. Waiting to get a check from mom, courtesy of co-op to cover car payment.  I think that's it on the finances. Phoebe has regained her sight, figure it was blurred vision from her surgery, and she lost an ear. We haven't found it yet. Babysat yesterday, cleaned the Family's house, did their laundry, entertained their kids, baked bad tasting cookies, and all of this for 6/hr. Makes me appericiate Moms, most of the time, they don't get paid at all. Nonetheless, I did work my ass off for little renumeration. And that sucks. The job is good, and it is satisfying in that i can see the day's work completed. That does not suck. As soon as i get a better paying job, I'm going to leave, that sucks; the dad is a prat, so that makes it not suck so badly.   Is it just me, or does life seem to be unecessarily complicated?  Also, Solace is having bad dreams similar to mine. We're both killing people a lot. No answers there, neither of us know where it's coming from. Not exactly worrisome, but makes one consdier carefully what one should eat before going to bed. We talked about Runes, you know, the ancient FUTHARK alphabet that a lot of modern languages come from. I've been in contact with runes since i was about 13. They've always been nice to ask advice of, offering consequences for asked-about actions. I had always assumed that this was a crude method of hearing whispers from the Divine, as a sort of conscience illustrating what i ought to do in a given situation. The other thought was that it was me, a sort of higher me, one that knew consequences better than I did. A Platonist Jiminy Cricket, i guess. Kurt offered another thought, though.. that perhaps the runes' are evil, or simply not good, or whatever. This throws me for a loop. I mean, I haven't even used them for a long time, and my other dalliance is easily explained using psychology; the runes are not. So where am I now? I've always liked the ceramic, one of the runes is where R comes from, the rune is called Raido, and it means journey. My sister's first letter is there too. The runes never acted like a voice in my head telling me to burn things, nor have they ever showed one particular destiny. What they had always done was show a call to action, and if the call to action was followed through, it showed the consequences of that action. Is that evil, or non good, or is it anything worth mentioning? is it the whispers i had taken them to be? Right now, my gut tells me that they are nothing worth mentioning, they never were, they were just a comforting toy, a glorified magic eight ball. An adolecent sooky-blanket. But they worked, or my brain found connections that had no business being there.  I still have them, largely unused, excepting on the occasions where i pick one up, and hope that it will be my first letter rune. They stay around like blind bear, or my wisdom teeth, or the book of fairy tales that used to facinate and frighten the shit out of me. (The Fairytales are the complete book of Grimm - not for the faint hearted.) I suppose, in the end, it doesn't largely matter where the info I was getting was coming from. If it was evil, good turned it round, and if it was good to begin with - good. The bottom line is that I don't need them any more to see the consequences of a particular action. Time to set aside childish things, i guess, but you don't have to throw them away.This getting up early in the morning crap has got to stop to spare my sanity. It's too cold to be real outside, there's nothing to do inside, and I can't seem to distract myself from feelings of 'I suck'ness. It could be boredom, cabin fever, or any one of those things that can get me feeling funky. After all, it is winter, and winter always gives me annoying feelings.  Phoebe appears to be blind. Her eyes react to light differences, but all she sees in general is a big blur. She is scared of Fida and to a lesser extent, Lucas, because she is unsure about what they're going to do. However, she still gets around ok, and she isn't in any pain, so,  we're ok too. Figure the cause of blindness was her operation, either a side effect from the anatheisa, a build up of spinal fluid pressure, or a combination. Talked to the vet myself, he wasa fucking idiot, and should never be near animals.  On the upside, she does seem to be coming around slowly. I hope i'm not just seeing what i want to see.Made it to the pub last night, although i came really close to not going; really glad I did. Did not get to talk to the Prof as much as I would like, but made new friends, enjoyed myself immensely, and felt relaxed.   Had a dream last night where I was doing an anti-war rally. I was yelling stuff from my soapbox, and I closed with "Fighting for peace is like fucking for virginity!!" Kurt was awake for some reason, and he thought i was talking to him. Hilarity somewhat ensued, although I stayed asleep for the whole thing. I remember the dream, but do not remember sitting up in bed and yelling that to Kurt. It was confusing, Kurt said.  We have a new foster cat, her name is Phoebe. Her uterus is newly removed, and when she was found, she was starving to death, and her ears had severe frostbite. She's very mellow, although she doesn't know what to make of Lucas. Fida doesn't like her, but I figure they'll get along when everything settles down. Phoebe might yet lose her ears. They look a little wrong, not much, but they're hard and seem like they'll crumble if you nudge them. I'm a little worried about her losing them; she won't be overly adoptable then, because a cat without ears looks a lot like a wee, fuzzy alien. A lot of people don't like aliens. No worries for her though, if there isn't anyone to adopt her, we probably will. She's black and white, and like Fida, hasa nose that's part pink and part black. Her fur is so shiny is seems almost blue. She's still very skinny, but she seems to be pretty happy with attention, regular meals, and a warm place to sleep. We'll put a gut on her yet.  Keep thinking about when I'll have to ditch my job. I like it, a lot, but there's not enough money. It's six an hour, and there's EVERYTHING to be paid,  food to buy, and I have no idea how we're going to make rent on time in march. I'll be making 240 a week when i begin regularily, and with the rent being 500/month, the car payment being 300 something, utilites about 150/month, and plus ring payments and other crap that I always forget about but comes to chomp on my butt later, the pay is frighteningly low. It's not entirely fair that being a nanny isn't considered skilled work, there's so much to know, do, remember, and hell, you're looking after children, ensuring their safety, I tend to find it a little weird that grants aren't given out to moms to have their kids taken care of well. Such is life, though. I feel dishonest, though, i mean the Family hired me in good faith, they probably wouldn't have if they knew I was in the market for something higher paying.   There's no need to be worrying about this. It's not going to help allievate guilt, or help me in any way. Zoodles, however, will feed my hunger. So, to Zoodles I now turn.Did the first full day of the nanny thing, one of the kids is big on saliva. BIG. I asked him to watch where he was spraying whilst feeding zee baby, and the kid turned his face up, spat, and caught it in his mouth. Yargh. I also did the family's laundry, and was momentarily disgusted by doing other people's laundry. The Family isn't dirty, or anything like that, but man, i was touching their underwear.  Besides momentary lapses into being profoundly disgusted, it wasa good day. played, read a lot on Greek Myths, and boogied with the baby.   Tonight, possibly, Kurt and I go out to the pub to hang out with the english professor that scared the crap out of me when I was a frosh. He's scotch, soft voice, nice, but occasionally was given to screaming and bashing his fist off the desk in class. I also noticed that year that the man was a close talker, and never reffered to anyone by name. Out of class he'd nod and wink at me. He's a great teacher, wow. Took Literary Criticism (AKA Literary Cynicism) with him my second year, and I probably have never had so much fun in a class in my life, although eating brandy chocolates in German frosh year is a close second.  Car payments are coming up, rent in a little bit, and I'm still not working full time. This observation typically causes me to crap and want to crawl under a rock and die, but, with the exception of my student loan, and our engagement rings; we are up to date on every single solitary bill. Yay! Of course, doing laundry just willy-nilly would be excellent, but hey, I'm saving my quarters for a pint with the professor.  Nothing more to say today, feel free to write in with a topic you'd like to read, and i'll pontificate away. Except you,Chad. You as a topic is not an option. If you want to read about yourself, either hire someone to write about you, or write it yourself, and pretend it's someone who knows you and talks about you insessantly. Or come down and visit me, and I'll write about that.Bless internet piracy in all its glory; i have movies on my computer via d/c, an excellent p2p sharing community thingamabob. Been spending time watching movies, most noteably, the Disney version of Robin Hood. Ahh, such sweetness.   Been half-assedly trying to remedy A) My life as a recluse and B) I don't have a name for this yet, although it may come under the Lazy catergory; I have this tendancy to not do things unless i have to. So there you go, two post-new year resolutions.  Granger and Co. help facilitate my foray into the wonderful world of shared movies; Kurt and I went over to her place on Saturday. Her varied and interesting circle of friends played a VCR Star Trek game. Watching it, and them, was hilarious. It's dumb, though. I enjoy my time there immensely, and I like Granger and her friends, even though i can't remember most of their names. However, I always feel I'm imposing. Like I'm an alien from another planet. This feeling is not exclusive to Granger and her merry band of tards, there's another friend here that I've known for a long time. And I'd say about every third time I talk to her, I feel the Me-As-An-Alien thing happen, and I wonder why would she like me, want to spend time with me, etc. Yeah, yeah, I'm a complicated weirdo, call it one of my eccentricities. I'll work on it next year. It does sort of happen with everybody. I get it in my head i'm a nuisance, and I'll vanish.   I beat Age of Mythology. Only on moderate, though. It was zarking hard nonetheless. I'm not one of those folks that always had a game console in my house; it was junior high before i didn't die on the first level of mario. And then, for years, I was preoccupied with how, in Mario's worlds, there appears to be no fricton. If you get a mushroom stuck between two pipes it will bang off each one until the end of time. If there was fricton, eventually the mushroom would slow, and eventually stop.  I had a weird dream last night, about my mom giving me a fantasically ugly and huge St. Christopher's medallion. Isn't it funny how people will almost always say  "I had a WEIRD dream last night" ? Like you need weird in there.. it's a given, really.  Rambling has set it, time to throw in the towel. Good night, or, should I say Good Morning, since that's when chad reads this.  I miss Cordy.HAHAAAAAA! Stupid illness! HAW!  I'm not sick anymore, think I managed to kick the vestiges by sleeping and more sleeping. Of course, this means that I am not sleeping right now, at 4am, but it is a small price to pay for having the sensation of drowning in one's own mucus removed from one's person. Air is nice.    Been reading "Bitch" by Elizabeth Wurtzel. At times, I have to put the book down because it's like getting socked in the gut. I know I wrote this before, but I do forget, being a semi-functional shut-in and all, that being female sucks ass. One could say that about being a man, too, I suppose, but I have no experience of that, and a lot of experience having boobs. Reading "Bitch" reminded me of how I felt when I worked at the golfcourse. Every day when I was on matinence, I was asked by co-workers to have sex with them.They assumed, because I was female, that I didn't swear, couldn't pump gas, or drive. On one occasion, a co worker grabbed my ass and held on. Before that, another one stuck out two fingers and said "Why should you use these two fingers to masturbate?" I shook my head, I mean, what the fuck do you say to things like that? "Because they're mine," he said, this guy who was married to a woman who used to babysit me.  What do you say to that? How do you react? It's stupid, but comments like that scare the hell out of me. Someone tried to rape me when I was nine, when I was in second year university, a guy tried to get into the shower with me in my dorm. So, when some guy says something like that to me, it's my knee-jerk response to be hostile, better to be thought of as a bitch than have this guy thinking I like and want his skanky attentions. I have this fear that the minute I'm even remotely nice to someone who sidles up to me at a bar, or makes a remark, that I'm just opening myself up for more of the same. Being a mouth was not an option at the golfcourse, because, well, it was a small hick place there, and any one getting on the unpopular list was going to be in a world of hurt. If I had of reported the ass grab, there's no doubt in my mind that I would have been fired. The guy that did it was in the union, was senior to me by at least 15 years, and I was but a mere student peon. A few years before, a girl had been raped, actually raped, and The Powers That Be made her drop the suit. No one would come forward,on her behalf although there were other women that this guy handled. They didn't come forward because, one told me "Well, what would everybody think of me, then? What if he beat me up? i just can't."  I let the ass grab slide, although, I summoned up all my bravado, sounded off a fair amount of expletives at the Man With The Wandering Hands, and told him if he so much as breathed on me again, I would rupture his nutsack. (We were alone, otherwise, I would have just laughed it off) He mumbled something scornfully about me being one of 'those liberated women types' and in the weeks that followed, I began a rumor that professed my homosexuality.  In later years, I became the Beer Cart girl and Bartender. Guys from away, dressed in golfer clothes and sporting bitch tits told me where their hotel room was and that they would make a visit from me worth my while. Out drinking with my friends at the legion, the golfers would be there, drunken tourists, all remembering me because I had helped get them drunk in the first place. That summer, I got to slow dance with a plethora of bad smelling, drunken golfers, and I didn't even have the recourse to tell them to fuck off. My boss let me know that. On golfcourse, or off, it didn't matter, Beer Cart Girl must always be the polite public servant.  What I really notice now, in and after university, is that either you aren't taken seriously enough as a girl, or you're way too intense. I can't count how many times I've been told that I think too much. Guys who talk about puking and pooping their pants at the same time whilst drunk can't handle the fact that their girl might have tampons in her medicine cabinet. And girls who like sex, well, they're sluts. Girls who don't are frigid. I was a girl who didn't, and I was a 'Dyke'. Or frigid, depending on who you talked to.  Seriously, I know guys have it tough. I'm not going to sit here and pontificate on how girls have it way worse. I don't know, and I don't care, to be honest. Every single one of us has a bunch of problems, I think most can be attributed to socialization and bad choices, or whatever. I'm just saying: "I hate it." There's no reason why guys have to be paragons of machismo, there is no logical reason why women get paid 70 cents on the dollar. It sucks that it doesn't matter if you'll be a better cop, the native chick is going to get it first, although she couldn't pass the old physical standards. (They changed them, so that way, women could bet into the RCMP easier. Fuck that. I don't care if a cop is a male or female, but they had better be in shape, and be competent in their job. A woman trained and did *well* as a Navy SEAL in the US, you cannot reasonably tell me it's impossible for a woman to achieve the old standard of RCMP physicals. And, on a side note, those cops should stay in shape. I'm talking yearly physcials, you doughnut eating freaks.)    None of it is fair.I really need to vacuum the floor.Hey!!! Tonight kids, I saw Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets.  SOOOOOO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!! Listen to me, you should all go see it.  I'm serious, it's so good.  Taylor says hi.  She accomponied me to see the film, let me tell you shes trouble to take out.  First of all, we get there early and she's all, "Lets go to dunkin donuts" For those of you who don't look outside, it was raining.  But I'm a nice kid so I went.  But on the way we encountered the puddle, the best way to describe this puddle would be to say it was about the same size as the atlantic ocean.  I didn't want to cross this puddle and in order to avoid it, and Taylor, I ran into Griebs pharmacy, where some serious funny business ensued.  Taylor chased me around the store, then yelled at me saying that we were acting like a couple, then she announced that she no longer needed me so I proceeded to turn around and she let out a cry, " CHUB CHUB NO!!!!!!!!! DON'T LEAVE ME!!!!!!" Well I found it very amusing so I saddled up and braved the puddle.  Then Taylor nearly drowned in one after that, but alas, we made it to Dunkin Donuts safely, where Taylor proceeded to buy a chai and get called a "Chiquita" by the guy behind the counter.  He gave her a sticker to, I think he wants her.  We made it safely back to the movie theatre, which was swarming with middle schoolers. Disgusting.  I decided tonight if I ever have children they're never going to be in middle school.  It's such an annoying age, so unnessicary.  I was going to kill those children, but anyways, the movie started and was fabulous.   I enjoyed it very much.  We then proceeded to return here, to my house, where we ate a lot of milk duds, and that folks, is my exciting life.  I leave you now with a quote that made me laugh very much today, it comes from none other, but Taylor.    *~Sooooo hot, want to touch the hiney~Taylor (when speaking about Ron Weasley)*   PS~ Bren and I went to the Y too and we're SO buff!!!!!!!!!! :o)Well, today was a very good day, to much relief.  I have amazing friends that make me feel so special and I'm taking this time to say thank you so much :o) I love you all oodles and boodles.  I got my permit, 100% on the test thank you very much, then I drove to the church to visit Julie, did ya catch that? Key phrase...I DROVE.  I know most of you out there that read my blog have your license...but ya know what? It's exciting for me.   I kinda realized last night that I get frustrated when I feel like people think they know me and judge me or whatever based on what they see and I just want to be like aah! You don't even know me!!! Which in a lot of cases is true because there is a lot about me people don't know, but then I also realized that its because I never tell them.  So if that makes any sense....my new goal is to be more open with people, and make better attempts to get to know people better, because I'm sure a lot of people feel the same way.  Also because there are a lot of people I know but don't really know that well, and I'd like to get to know better.  I think it would be nice.  So with that said!! I'm going to get some homework done then head to club!! Later gator :o)   *~Sing a sog, dance and celebrate...you've got today~Eliot Morris~*Hey kids! Well today there was so much to do but its all done now! I had an english presentation which I lost my voice in the middle of..but it was all good cause my teacher understood.  Then an algebra test, then a history test, but its all done!!!!! I didn't really do much homework....didn't really feel like it.  Got a phsyics test tomrrow that I'm not studying for.  But we all know physics is a joke.  *L-GaB* was supposed to go on tonight, but alas, we are put off again.  But just wait!!!! We will be awesome!!!! hehehehehehe :o) Hmm...this is not so intersting.  Bussey told me today that he reads 19 blogs...I don't feel so special for having a blog anymore.  But alas, I will get over it.  I just used the word alas...sorry, I'm reading the Scarlet Letter, some crazy old english junk.  So my day was basically unproductive after the whole school part, I was letting my brain rest.  I'm gonna go now, because I'm hungry and want some oreos!  *~Sometimes its easier to pretend you dont care than let your true feelings show and have your heart hurt more~* (oh what an emo little meggie) heheheheheDay 2 of the new blog...in all honesty, I'm still warming up to it.  I miss my old one, we shared some good times.  But it is nice to be blogging again.  Today nothing at all exciting happened in school, but thats ok.  Then Taylo came over and proceeded to distract me from doing any work for four hours...but thats ok too, because I love her. WAIT!! Something exciting did happen in school!!! Heres how it goes, Matt Karlan is my lab partner, and as some of you may know, he's a smart kid, and we were doing problems today, and I got one right that he got wrong! And we'd been debating who did it right, and I totally owned him, it was quite exciting because I never get anything right in that class. So yeah, now I'm putting off more homework, which really isn't a good idea, and I should probably get to it! But blogging is so fun!!!! ADIOS!!! *~Whatever tomorrow brings I'll be there, with open arms and open eyes yeah..~*Hey! So with the new makings of blogs everywhere I started to miss my old blog (meggiesblog.blogspot.com), which somehow died, and I decided to make a new one!! I'm excited, and hopefully this one will work.  Rest in peace old blog.  Well! Volleyball is over and its crazy how much afternoon there is.  I feel like its been two days since I was last at school, and its really been six hours.  Crazy, I'm tellin ya.  Wanna hear a funny story? Ok.  Today I walked into a chair in the caf.  Was that funny? I'm not sure, I thought it was.  Ok well in all honesty nothing exciting happened today, so I'm gonna go watch some tv.  Later gator!! (oh and don't you worry! the quotes back too!!)  *~ You know that place between sleep and awake, the place where you can still remember dreaming? That's where I'll always love you....That's where I'll be waiting.~Peter Pan*Yesterday was much fun.  Except for the morning where my mother abandoned me at the emergency room to have my foot chopped open, so that she could make her hair appointment.  Then after the sketchy doctor cut open my foot, and patched it back up and what not, I call my sister to see where she is, but she's lost.  So me and my numb foot take a walk down the street to try and find the sister, but did I mention it was about 2 degrees out? Then as we are trying to find eachother on the phone, a van packed full of guys drives by, honks and presses themselves up against the window waving.  But finally my sister found me, and my still numb, and now cold foot got in the car and returned home.  After that, the day was fabulous.  Bren and I visited George, and he got us really cute neckalces (thanks George!) then we went to Wendys and came back and Taylor joined us, then Claire and Taylor convinced George to see Harry Potter so we all took a trip and saw it.  Harry was just as hot as he was the first time I saw it.  Taylor still wants Ron (I just don't see it) and Bren has affectionate feelings for Oliver Wood.  Unfortunately, George was not a fan.  Maybe when Hermione grows up he'll start enjoying it a little more.  Then we stopped at Dunkin Donuts (no Bren, not Duncan Doughnuts hahahahaha) and got some yummies.  After that we came back to my house and watched some of Contact.  It was enjoyable.  Today I woke up, showered, went to Nicks to have lunch with him and Katie, then we watched Spiderman and now I am home again.  Isn't that exciting? Well thats about it kids...I'm off to entertain myself :o)   *~Now I've got a peace of mind, there's just no better way.  And if I should die tonight, that would be alright.  I'm gonna try real hard, no matter what it takes and even if I fail.  I know that when life's done, and I'm accounted for, I lived it to the full.~Hangnail*I like this song, and it explains what I am thankful for on this Thanksgiving! :o)   *~I found it hard to believe, someone like you came for me you put this love in my heart I tried,  I could, I refused, you gave me no time to choose you put this love in my heart  I wanna know where the bad feelings go when I'm depressed  and I get down so low then if I see you calling to me,  it's all right I wanna tell you right now,  I'm not afraid to say how you put this love in my heart there's sometimes  when I doubt, but you offer me out you put this love in my heart  cause when I see that you died for me so when I was down  I had to believe cause you following her,  proving all your love and I know the loneliness I've had before in god now,  I never feel it anymore cause your lovin has released me  from all that is in my past so much more I could say  if I could just find a way you put this love in my heart  it's all so thrilling to me,  I feel so good I could scream you put this love in my heart I wanna know  where the bad feelings go when I'm depressed  and I get down so low then if I see you calling to me,  it's all right~*   ~Mxpx "You Put this Love in my heart"*aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!! Yeah besides that, Happy Thanksgiving!!! :o)Sorry kids, I don't even really know if anyone reads this...but just in case you do, it's not going to be a happy entry.  So if you don't want to read it, then I should warn you.  Today was good though, it was a nice snow day with lunch with Julie and Katie. Then Dave took me out to dinner with him and Gavven and it was fun.  Then Dave dropped me off at Amandas where I saw all the kids home from college.  Yeah, it made me so sad.  I came home early, and I'm sad.  I was so excited to see them and hang out with them again, but I guess seeing them made me realize how much I really miss them and how much everything has changed.  It's not the same at all now, and I realized how hard it is for me to not have them here.  I'm not saying that I don't have friends here because I do, and I love them.  But these kids, especially Kyle and Amanda have known me so long and know me so well, they're the people that know when something is wrong and I don't even say anything.  I just love them so much and it's so hard to not have them here.  And I have friends here that I have fun with and talk to, but I don't know, I can't even explain it really, I just miss them so much and tonight made me really sad for some reason.  Yeah, I don't know if that made any sense.  It's just me trying to explain how I'm feeling.  Night kids...   *~Could it be any harder to say goodbye and without you, could it be any harder to watch you go, to face what's true.  If I only had one more day...~The Calling*Job well done ladies....*L-GaB*, you made me proud :o)   *~Yeah, Julie? Hi....Right...my dog died....~* hahahahahahahahahahahahahaHellllllo, don't worry kids, I'm in a better mood today.  I just had to get that out yesterday.  Today was a pretty good day, I was just very sleepy.  Then I went to the Y, and Alex was there, and we chatted...but ya know what? I've known the guy 2 years and he still can't remember my name.  Amazing.  But anyways, the little anger and frustration that I had worked up today over a stupid boy, was worked out, and it felt good.  I think I may have a new addiction to working out, is that bad? It's just a really good way to get out my frustration I decided.  L-GaB TONIGHT!!!!! AH! So excited!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Yeah, we're gonna own it ladies.  Hmmmm.....yeah, what else? Nothing really....short blog, sorry kids.  Adios!  *~Never thought those times would last forever, but now that they're gone, I'm pretty sure we grew up to fast. I've had my wishes on a star, I hope that yours came true.~Ataris*Today wasn't really a bad day, not really a good day.  I guess I'm just havin all mixed up feelings sorta.  I think it's with all the kids coming home from college and seeing them and realizing how much I miss them, and I gues sorta feeling left behind.  I don't really let myself think about them because then I realize how much I miss them, but now that they're all coming back I remember and realize how much I've missed them and how much everything has changed.  It's not like everything has changed and is bad, it's just so different, and I've lost so many people that I was so close to, and I guess it's just feeling like I lost the people that I could trust and depend on the most and now I don't have a lot of people really at all that understand me or that I can really just go to whenever.  I know that it's also my fault because I take a really long time to trust people and to open up to them. Blah, I'm not making sense...I'm just babbling.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that today I just had a kinda lonely, left behind, not really having any friends day.  So yeah...  *~Everybody knows it hurts to grow up and everybody does...Let me tell you what the years go on and we're still fighting it, we're still fighting it...~Ben Folds*Ya know what really sucks kids? When you write a nice lengthy blog, and the people out there in blog publishing land decide they don't like it...and bye bye nice long blog.  Yeah, that just happened to me.  Anyways...yesterday was good times.  I babysat my favorite child in the universe Wil Sorenson, and we spent some quality time together.  Then Bren and I went shopping which was time well spent.  Then a quick trip to Dunkin Donuts, picked up Tash and went to GIGA, which is always good times.  After that we headed to the play, which I enjoyed, even though it was slow at parts, but thats what you get when you turn an old book into a play folks.  Then we were all ready to L-GaB in the best way ever, but our target was mia, much to our disappointment.  But don't fear ladies, we will own it.  Today, I went to church and drove and it was exciting and now I am going to hang out with Ms. Amanda Cary because she is home from big kid college, yay!!!! Lalala, ok kids thats all for now, adios!   *~Don't let your dreams and love just live on the shelfs like dust cause time is passing fast away don't let your worries moev you, sing a dance and celebrate, you've got today...~Eliot Morris*   (yeah I know I used part of it the other day, but it's really good. Here I'll give you another to make up for it.)   *~I still get lost in your eyes, and it seems like I can't live a day without you, closin my eyes, and you take my thoughts away to a place where I am blinded by the light...~*Wow I like this song, a lot.....  "So it's safe to say that we've been here before; Heart torn out, down for the count and still come back for more. This lesson is learned too well. Though, only unlearned by the time your wounds have healed. Have you had enough? I guess not because your lips are stuck to his. It's Time to say enough is enough, you would be so better off. You love him but tough because it's not coming back from him. You can't win. Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on. Take a look around, you could have anyone. So leave undeserving him. It only hurts at first. But then you will find someone to give you everything you want. Try not to go running back to him. So it goes unsaid that we've been here before. Lonely nights and endless fights and sleeping on the floor. And he's sorry, so the story goes. It's read and replayed and ends the same way Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on. Take a look around, you could have anyone. So leave undeserving him. Stop expecting change, he's just a lost cause that you're waiting on. Take a look around, you could have anyone. "  ~Starting Line "Saddest Girl Story"Holla....Today was mucho fun.   Although we didn't have the much anticipated snow delay, school wasn't that bad.  I'm SO glad this week is over.  In physics, Matt (my sit next to kid) is mad at me because I gave him the silent treatment yesterday, so he didn't sit next to me.  But Sarah Bruno and I passed notes, just like middle school.  It was funny because once by accident I passed it right in front of my teacher, and then dropped it on the ground, again by accident, while still looking him straight in the eye, then proceeded to ask a question while picking it up.  I didn't even get in trouble.  Welcome to Mr. Marrashs world of physics.  Then ya know, Carly told some jokes, and we debated what color Mr. Marrash's hair was.  That was probably the highlight of school.  Then Taylo came over and George, Stella and Brian soon followed.  We hung out for a while and then Hathaway came with James and stole Brian, and our idea of sledding.  James said for us to call him at 6 to go sledding.  So we hung out a while longer, then called James and he told us to go to Arties to go sledding.  After waiting for my mom and getting all our snow stuff we were really late and called James to tell him we were on our way, he says ok.  Then he calls back like one minute later telling us we can't go anymore, that Arties parents didn't want everyone there or something, so we had to find somewhere else to go.  So we turned around and came home.  But don't worry, we made our own fun, and a lot of it.  Stella, George, Taylora, and I frolicked and played in the back yard snow, then watched Monsters Inc with Tash.  Stella had to go home though cause he has SATs.  So the four of us hung out a little, then Tash left, then Taylor and I walked George home.  Now we're here again, and we're having a sleepover.  It's good Chub Chub and Taylo time, you know how it is.  Adios my friend.   *~Freedom means love without condition, without a beginning or an end.  Heres my heart, let it be forever yours only you can make every new day seems so new....Light up the world, burning bright, within our hearts forever~ FIF*Hey, sorry for causing some of you distress with my blog last night.  I didn't mean any harm.  Today was a much better day, I slept in and woke up to do more work, then went into school at 9:30.  Only to find out that we had an early dismissal...so I basically was only in school for 3 hours, and 2 classes were a free and art.  But yeah, still big history test tomorrow.  I'm taking a study break right now actually.  Ahhh I can't wait for this time tomorrow, you don't EVEN know.  So yeah I babysat Wil today too and it was good times as always, he is such a cute kid.  When you're stressed it is nice to hang out with little kids, because they just don't care about anything.  It's nice.  But yeah, there is still boy stuff.  Haha, it'd be nice if I could just get over it....but that doesn't look like it'll happen.  I know Tash!! I need to stay in check!! But I'm not.....yeaah......haha.  Ok well I have to get back to studying!! HAPPY SNOW!   *~I cant wait for this to end, and leave tonight behind us, I'm unsettled letting go of you, and sleeping the night in silence~Starting Line* (Thanks Tash!)Ah, I think I'm having a mental breakdown.  For real.  I went to school today, after waking up 45 minutes late, with having done, oh..no homework.  Went through a full day of no frees, not ONE break.  Came home, did 5 straight hours of homework, and wait, it's still not done.  But I can't do anymore, my brain just doesn't work.  I took a break and drove to Shaws with my dad which was probably the highlight of my day, because I got to talk to him and not think about school for a little bit, it was nice.  Then I came home and I don't think thats where I lost it....Don't get me wrong, I love all my friends and it makes me really happy that they feel like they can come and talk to me about problems and stuff but I signed on and literally five people were having problems, and it was a little overwhelming, and I kinda had a mini-breakdown.  I don't know...I guess it was one of those times when it would have been nice if someone asked me about me, but whatever.  I'm just stressed and tired.  I'm going to go talk to my mom now and see if she'll let me miss first and second period tomorrow.  I just need sleep and rest and I don't even know, just time to not be doing anything, because honestly that time doesn't exsist right now.   I miss summer, and not having anything to do ever.  Ok well I'm going to go talk to my mom and go to sleep.  Night night*   *~You got to hold on to what you got things might fall apart, but it don't mean nothing less you stick to your ways.  You got to hold on to what you got...~Pat McGee Band*Today in physics Sarah Bruno pushed the handle on the eye wash station by accident during lab, and it exploded like a volcano of water.  It had to be the funniest thing I've ever seen in my life.  I honestly laughed for like 10 minutes, and Sarah had a mini-heart attack.  Then Mr. Marrash and I got into a deep conversation about whether or not Santa's real.  He's got this whole magical elf other dimension theory...I don't know, but it got us off physics for a nice long time.  Good times.  Then I came home and watched Cruel Intentions, sat down to do my homework, realized that wouldn't happen, dilly dallied around until Shac, which was even more good times, then came home tried again to do homework...but ya know what? Tonight is one of those nights where it's just not happening.  Basically I'm screwing myself over for tomorrow, but oh well.   So yeah, on another note, I'm still trying to let go of this guy that just doesnt seem to go away.  Being friends would be so much better then being caught with all this emotion crap, oh well, I just gotta get over it.  We shall see!   *~Of all the things I believed in, I just want to get it over with, tears form behind my eyes, but I do not cry, countin the days that passed me by.  I've been searchin deep down in my soul, words that I'm hearin are startin to get old.  Feels like I'm startin all over again...~Good ol' Michelle Branch*Yeah...well....That person I was talking about before...I need to get over that, obviously they don't want to be friends. I'm sick of feeling like I always have to make the effort.  Blah.Hola chillins....Today was monday, and school.  I feel like I've been on break for like 2 weeks, and now I have to go back.  But it's ok, because only three weeks til break.  Thats nice.  School was ok though, I did pretty well on a big fat history project, and that made me happy.  Then in physics Matt Karlan asked me to marry him, it was funny.  That class is funny only because I sit next to him and Sarah Bruno, it provides for much entertainment.  Hmm what else....I went to drivers ed for the first time, isn't that exciting.  There were only like six people there, I learned about drinking and driving.  Yeah, you're not supposed to...imagine that.   Yeah so I guess recently I've been thinking about someone a lot, and how they kind of have this strange affect on my life, I can't really explain it, but I've been thinking about it, and how it frutrates me that this person doesn't seem to let anyone in and I get frustraed that I can't figure them out.  Anyways...that explains my quote.  I'm going to take a bathtub because I'm FREEZING!!!!! adios :o)    *~If you need it, something I can give I know I'd help you if I can. If your honest and you say that you did you know that I would give you my hand, or a sad song in a lonely place, I'll try to put a word in for you. Need a shoulder? Well if that's the case, you know there's nothing I wouldn't do.  Where we're living in this town the sun is coming up and it's going down but it's all just the same at the end of the day. ~Oasis*PS~ I love you too Tash!!!!!!!!!!!!! You're awesome :o)Oh man, that was funny.  Last night Hathaway and like 20 other guys invaded my driveway and owned Brens car.  I must say, it was so funny, depends and post it notes? Very creative.  It was even funnier because I had called it like 10 minutes earlier that they would get her car, considering that she had left it in my driveway unattended for about 2 hours.  They were all still there hiding when we came back, and we almost caught Keith, but he had some smooth driving skills and got away.  But they left behind Artie and George...we got George and he stayed with us for a little while, it was fun times.  Hathaway better watch out though, caues L-GaB is going to own him yet again.  Besides that, last night Bren and I went to the diner with Gavven and Dave and Tash met us there and came back to my house with us.  It was good times overall.    *~Before you jump to conclusions about all the friends I have, I'd like to remind you that they were born that way~NFG*Hahahahahahahaha Oh man, I just had the funniest conversation ever with Charmaine.  She was listening to her island music in the car and started talking to me about it, and the way they dance, and when she dances with guys and stuff like that at pubs.  And she was saying how once this Jamacian guy (she's Trinidadian for those of you who didn't know) asked her to dance and they were dancing but she said he moved his hips to much like a girl, and she had to tell him to ease up because she was the girl.  It was so funny.  She is so funny when she gets going.  Yay! Leaving for Champion in 20 minutes!!! So excited.  It's going to be so cold though.  Well kids, I'm signin out for the weekend but I'll leave you with the funniest quotes of the day.     First~ Today in Physics (do I talk about this class enough?) We were talking about the Pharoes building the pyramids and Carly was like "Weren't the Jews forced to do it?" and Matt Karlan, who sits next to me, and is Jewish was like, " Look at me. Do I look like I could build a pyramid? Look at these hands, they're satin" Oh man, it was funny.     Second~ From my very funny conversation with Charmaine, talking about the dance she's going to tonight, "If the DJ play good, I'm goin dance....I didn't go to no dance to talk, I'm going to BOOTY."   Good times...hahahahaToday, I went to drivers ed, and during class I went to the bathroom and realized that the whole time I've been going to drivers ed I've been using the boys bathroom, so feeling stupid I found the girls bathroom. But I couldn't find the light in the girls bathroom, but feeling stupid already I decided to just pee in the dark instead of going back to the boys bathroom.  Well all was good until I looked up and realized their was a skylight (not that any light was coming in because it was dark) but there were shadows, and I somehow convinced myself that an alien was watching me pee on top of the window and I got all freaked out and ran out of the bathroom (after wiping and flushing of course) but let me tell you, it was scary.  Not to mention yesterday there was an Easter bunny on tv, and if you know me you know I was NOT ok with that.  At all.  So needless to say, it's been a scary 2 days.  Yeah.  Today....I don't remember anything particularly exciting or worth writing about besides what I previously shared with you...so this is where I shall end.    *~ You should have seen that sunrise, with your own eyes...it brought me back to life~ John Mayer*I have a problem.  I am addicted to free cell.  I even have the addiction mentality.  Want to know how bad it is? Here was my internal dialouge "Oh boy Meggie, you're so addicted to this game.  No I'm not, I could stop whenever I wanted.  Fine, then stop this game ight now.  No! I don't have to prove that I'm not addicted, I know I'm not.  Meggie, you have a problem."  Thats bad folks, thats real bad.  Don't ever start playing free cell.Hey kids....well in all the depression of yesterday I forgot to tell you all about the good parts! During physics lab, Mr. Marrash went on a 25 minute tangent, first about the origin of horse power, then about one handed push ups, then about the army.  It was so funny.  He just went off about it.  It was just flowing. Then during the second half of lab he went on another tangent, but I don't even remember what it was about.  All I know is that I don't ever learn anything in that class.  But hey, it's funny.  What was my other funny story? I can't remember.  But don't worry, there was funiness yesterday.  Today, I didn't really have many classes....and no physics!!! SO nice!!!! I got some nice fun stuff at CVS and then I went to the Y, and I think I figured out that another reason I've been having such mood swings is cause I haven't been exercising. I decided that working out makes me feel so much better and gets out a lot of frustration.  So it's good.  I feel good now, yay :o)  Yeah...still haven't done homework....I should go work on that....  *~More and more I need you now, I owe you more each passing hour the battle between grace and pride I gave up not so long ago.  So steal my heart and take the pain and wash the feet and cleanse my pride take the selfish, take the weak, and all the things I cannot hide take the beauty, take my tears the sin-soaked heart and make it yours take my world all apart take it now, take it now... ~Jars of Clay*Yeah, so I'm in a not so good mood again.  Sorry about that.  It seems like when I post I'm either really happy or really not.  I just have to make it to Christmas, I know my mood swings are just cause I'm tired and really stressed.  Two more weeks then a nice long break and I'll be ok.  I'm just letting things get to me and not focusing on the things that I should.  Then that stuff starts to really bother me and I get all down and what not.  The volleyball banquet was tonight and it was really good, but at the same time I can't help but be jealous of the juniors that played this year and that got captains, I know they deserved it and I am really happy for them because no one else deserved it, but theres still that small part of me thats like what if I had done this sooner or whatever, and I get all frustrated.  It's stupid and just needs to be gotten over.  Then theres the fact that I just don't understand people, and I know that that also has a lot to do with me and the fact that I put up such gaurds and don't let people see me but then I get hurt when they do stuff, not even knowing that it's hurting me.  It's all quite stupid.  I just have a lot of stuff to get over I guess.  Yeah well I have a lot of homework, and no I have not started it.  So I'm going to do that.  Night darlings.     *~Some say that time changes, best friends can become strangers, but I dont want that, no not for you. If you just stay with me we can make it through...~Good Charlotte*So last night was the silver ring thing, and I thought it was really good.  I'm feelin a lot better about the whole issue of  guys in general, it's nice.  Besides that yesterday I was in the Living Nativity, I was Mary and Wes was my Joseph.  It was good times.  At one point Wes hugged me and the kings told us to cut it out,  I thought it was amusing.  Hmmm what else, nothing really.  I'm hungry, and going to lunch with some kids later, but for now maybe I'll go start my homework because lets be honest, there's always something to be done Junior year.  Blah.     *~I don't know, I was DISTRAUGHT!!!!~Moaning Myrtle*  hahaha I love Harry Potter :o)Last night was the gift exchange at the Shac, and it was good times.  After that was the show, and the Good Fight played, and I love watching them play, so that made me happy.  Then Taylo slept over...like always.  This morning we had a really good conversation about our future husbands, and it was awesome, that's something to look forward to right there.  Then today she, Booth and I went to see Two Weeks Notice, but they were on their assigned date for Chemistry that their teacher is making them go on because they talk to much in class, so I was the third wheel, but whatever, it was all good.  While we were leaving the food court, this woman walks by with her husband I guess or boyfriend, and her daughter, who was probably like 5, and the woman out of nowhere just yells at the guy, and what she said will be my quote of the day, so I won't write it here, you have to wait til the end to see it.  It was so funny though.  Then Taylor and I went to GIGA, and it was good times like usual. Now I'm home, and bored, and I think I might watch The Land Before Time, yeah, on a Saturday night, it's ok, I'm comfortable with it.  So heres the quote you've been waiting for....  *~Don't ask me for sex, NO more!!! ~ Woman in the mall talking to her man*Yesterday, I walked into a wall. It was early in the morning and I didn't really have my eyes open because the light was so bright and going to go get into the shower I walked into the wall.   If I hadn't been so tired I probably would have laughed more at myself.  But I kinda grumbled.  But looking back on it, it was really funny.  This week hasn't been that bad so far, it's been a lot easier then I thought it would be, and after I hand in my Transcendental Notebook tomorrow life will be fabulous, 12 day weekend as Matt Nelson put it.  GOOD times.  Today in physics Mr. Marrash told us that everyone should be happy because it's almost Christmas, and my trusty lab partner Matt Karlan was like, "Um, I'm Jewish." and it made me laugh a lot, then we were talking about what he got for Hanukah, or however you spell it, and he was telling me and then he said, "My two front teeth" and I said "Matt thats a   Christmas   gift." all exagerating and what not, and he goes, " Well you know what! I actually got three!! What'd you have to say to that!!!" I thought it was really funny, thats why I just spent all this time sharing it.  Then this girl in my art class made me mad because she's stupid and was trying to talk about things she doesn't actually know anything about all like she does know.  I snapped on her a little bit.  But it's ok.  Now I'm off to finish this stinkin notebook...and it will practically be the weekend. YAY!!!  Adios my friends :o)   *~I know that you believe in the one, true God above.  And that's why you're waiting for your one and only love. Do your feet hurt? Did you fall from Heaven? Cause you've been runnin through my mind all day, my mind don't mind...~ MxPx*Well, this weekend was Lake Champion, I guess it was good, but I kinda had a rough time.  Anyways, today was an amazing day, I'm tellin you, when you leave stuff up to God, he makes awesome stuff happen.  Basically last night I came home like dead tired and just feeling like a blob and barely did any homework or studying, knowing that today I dropped my free and had a huge AP History test that I knew nothing about.  So I prayed a lot and went to bed.  Then today, I had a sub in Physics (if you know Mr. Marrash you'll understand why this is a miracle...the man never gets sick) and got to do a lot of work then.  But wait, out of nowhere my history teacher decides to move the test to tomorrow.  What the heck! God is awesome.  Now do you want to hear a funny story? Ok. In English class first period I was kind of asleep and just kind of watching people more then taking part in life, and this kid across the room from me blows his nose, and he pulls the tissue away and this booger the size of your mom comes out attached to the tissue, and he like tried to play it off, but I was the only one that saw.  And I had to try so hard not to laugh, but I really wanted to crack up, oh man it was funny.   But then again you gotta feel bad for the kid, cause who wants a huge booger hangin out of their nose....not me.  Anyways, Kyles home!! And she and her nine friends are coming to visit..and I need to study for that history test, so I'm outie.  Much love.    *~ I let you slip through my fingers, don't even know if I can remember how I got here in the first place.  My mind wanders off it's somewhere out in space.  Laziness it consumes you there's nothing you can say, there's nothing you can do.  Simply put I'm letting go~ Hot Rod Circuit*  I love when songs know exactly how you feel.  :o)Merry Christmas! Hmmm....this Christmas has been very uneventful, and it doesn't even really feel like Christmas.  I woke up super early because my brother is still little and is all about the getting up early to open gifts, and I did that, and I didn't get much, just some clothes and a dvd, because I already got my SNOWBOARD which was all I really wanted and I'm in love with it.  So after that I went back to sleep until 12, and I'm still really tired, I think I may have mono.  I'm so tired.  Who knows, we're eating in like an hour and then I think I might just go back to bed, because it's either that or bum around my house all night, because everyone is away, or having family time, which my family seems to always lack in on the holidays.  Well until it's time to eat I'm going to go sit on the couch.    *~ I'm learning to breathe, I'm learning to crawl, I'm findin that you and you alone can break my fall.  I'm living again, awake and alive, I'm dyin to breathe in these abundant skies...~Switchfoot*Hahaha I've had a funny day with my dad.  It started this morning where he had had a lot of coffee, and if any of you know my daddy, he's crazy.  So he was making fun of me and being the crazy old man he is and started telling me about some practical joke someone played that he thought was really funny and some other stuff.  Then we got in a fake fight and I told him I was going to beat him up and he told me I could try but I wouldn't be able to, but I did, I owned my dad because he's old, I gave him two wedgies, he told me that the next friend that comes over he's going to give them a wedgie to embarrase me.  Then I wanted to go to the Y and my dad let me drive, but   it as closed, and the parking lot was empty, so we practiced parking, because I suck at parking.  My dad kept making me park between the curb and a line and he kept telling me not to hit the bumb, and then I hit the bumb, it was funny.  So after that I came home and showered and ate some pizza then picked up my pretty new snowboard at the sport shop, where everyone and their mom decided to be.  Now I'm at home again, and I'm going to church in a lil bit, and then going again with my sister later.  My mommy made really good cranberry bread, I think I'll go eat it.  OH! And I saw the second Lord of the Rings last night, and it is SO good and I'm in love with Elijah Wood, even thogh he's not really in the second one.  And Tash is SO cute, she got me these really cute earrings from Baubles that I've wanted for a really long time but I've just been to lazy to get, so today, Tash is my favorite.  :o)   *~Don't hit the bumb, don't hit the bumb, don't hit the bumb...You hit the bumb~My crazy father*Well, I just returned from lunch with Katie Bennett, it was nice.  Sometimes I feel bad that I don't hang out with my old friends anymore but then when I do hang out with them it's so different, and the fact that with so many of my friendships now have the faith based element it makes them so much better, and different from my old friendships, I don't know, hard to explain.  But I had a good time with Katie and I like her very much.  Then I was very productive and scheduled a dermatologist appt, a dentist appt, and a haircut, even though I already cut my own hair this morning, and I must say I did a pretty good job.  But it still needs the aid of a proffesional I suppose.  Earlier today I met Taylor at Booths wrestling match and he won, it was intense.  I actually enjoyed watching wrestling, it's a cool sport.  Last night I watched the first Lord of The Rings with Bren and Katie, and it was so good, Elijah Wood is SO cute.  I have such a thing for dark hair and blue eyes, I love it, I already decided the guy I marry has to have blue eyes and dark hair, it's the only way it's going to work.  But right now I'm not looking for my husband, or any guy, which is nice.  It's so nice to finally be getting to a place where I'm not caring about boys as anything more then friends, because lets be honest it's taken a long time.  Anyways, tonight Bren and I are seeing the Twin Towers because we are officially Lord of the Ring dorks, especially after we  figured out that we're Hobbits.  It's our true calling in life...they eat like 6 meals a day, welcome to the lives of Bren and Meggie.  Wow, this has been a really long blog, I'm going to go do something else now.  :o)   *~I don't think he knows about second breakfast....What about Elevensies!?!?!?!~hahahaha the Hobbits* hahahahaI don't have much to blog except that in history today Mr. Clarke was talking about some sixth grader he met and made conversation with and our class started making fun of him for hanging out with sixth graders and he went off abot it kind of and my quote is directly from Mr. Clarke. Goodnight.   *~You know, talkin it up with my homies in the hood~Silly little Moonie man*Happy New Year!!!! Well I must say, not to toot my own horn, but last night I had a very good time.  I believe my sister and I were successfull in our party endeavor.  And if we didn't provide any entertainment let me tell you, other kids did.  I listened to Matt F. tell elementary school stories for like 2 hours, and I've never laughed so hard in my life.  He told the funniest stories I've ever heard.  Not to mention, TAYLORS HOME!!!! I missed her so much kids, you don't even know.  So last night she slept over, duh, and we had 3 full hours of Taylo and ChubChub time, it was so good.  Then today I've been being a bum all day, I went to Blockbuster to see if they had the movie I needed for history, but it was checked out, so I gave up on that pretty quickly.  Earlier I worked on the big fatty paper I have due on Friday, and it's now 3 pages done...2 to go.  Now I'm going to go get some yummy tea and watch some tv until dinner, because it's the last day of vacation, and I don't want to ruin it by being active.  Adios chicos and chicas.  OH! And by the way if any of you know Preston he likes to call me by my middle name, which I don't have to say, but last night I found out that his middle name is Edgar.  I thought I'd share that with you.  Ok bubye I love you.    *~I guess we've had our fun, but it seems our fun is over now and that's all right. It's all right.  Time for me to move along, and after all is said and done, I'll be all right.  It's all right~Fenix TX*So, I just got back from Stratton.  It was fun.  Ready for a story? Ok.  So before we leave my mom is all, "Theres a VERY attractive boy thats your age that'll be there, he's Dune and Johns nephew, blah blah blah" So I'm all " Ok mom, whatever you say."  So we get there and I see this kid. First of all the kid looked like he was 10,  not to mention he was wearing Tigger pajamas.  Then he started talking, and he was one of those kids that you're just a little weirded out by constantly.  Oh, and he's a freshman.  Then on the second night all 8 of us children are sitting in the family room watching Sleepless in Seattle and I look over at him quickly and I swear I though I saw him take something out of his hair and put it in his mouth, but I dismissed this idea.  Later my sister nudges me and I look over, and the child has his entire big toe in his mouth, and is chewing on it.  What the heck!!??!!!?? I don't even know kids.  So now it's becoming really hard to not start laughing so I have to watch the movie again, then I glance over again, and this time, the kids done with his toe apparently and is PICKING HIS LEG HAIR and eating it.  I'm telling the truth people, he was plucking his leg hair and eating it.  Throughout the evening he went back to his toe, and chewed on it, or just picked at it and ate whatever came off.    And the worst part is he wasn't even trying to make it a secret, he was doing it in front of 7 other kids, not trying to hide it.  I don't know kids, I don't know.  I don't even know if my foot reaches my mouth.  It's all crazy business.  Otherwise though the snowboarding was really fun and I had a good time in that area.  Now my sister and I are home and it's time for FUGIS!!!   *~Yeah we make great friends but it just isn't the same...~Good Charolette*Hey, just a quick post before I leave for Okemo! I just wanted to apologize in advanced for not blogging for the next few days...because unlike all you other neglectful blog owners, I blog and quite frequently.  So, I'm sorry, if anyone reads this.  But I don't think anyone does.  Anyways, hopefully I will not fall and die snowboarding and I will be back to blog Sunday night.  Have a good weekend!Wow, I have been such a school slacker this week that it's not even funny.  But I've done pretty well for it...I got an 96 on my math test, and think I did pretty well on my english mid-term today.  Besides that today I went to the Y, and worked out so hardcore, I felt SO good after.  I got some pictures developed from New Years, showered, did a little work for the second part of my english mid-term tomorrow...and watched a lot of tv.  Darn, my life is exciting.  Anyways, what else, I've realized recently that I have a new found love for Norah Jones, yes Emily, I stole her completely from you.  I know this.   But Emily left the cd here and I listened to it yesterday, because I've heard a few of her songs and enjoyed them, and this cd is SO good.  She has a really awesome voice and all the songs are so good.  So thats my Norah Jones plug.  Okemo tomorrow, I feel bad, like I'm not excited enough, yes I am excited, but other people are so excited, and I feel like I need to get more hyped.  I'll work on that.  Well, I'm outie kids.    *~Nightingale Sing us a song Of a love that once belonged Nightingale Tell me your tale Was your journey far too long?  Does it seem like I'm looking for an answer To a question I can't ask I don't know which way the feather falls Or if i should blow it to the left  All the voices that are spinnin' around me Trying to tell me what to say Can I fly right behind you And you can take me away~Norah Jones*Well I think today was possibly even more uneventful then yesterday.  I went to school, took an algebra test, came home, went to the dermatologist, came home, got a little bitter, studied, ate, studied, and watched tv.  The best part of my day was when I put up an away message that said I was sad and Kyle called me alllll the way from North Carolina to ask me why I was sad.  She is the bestest ever, and wins my favorite person for the day award.  Anyways, big fatty english midterm tomorrow.  It shall be interesting.  In other news, Charmaine is so funny.  On the way to the dermatologist she was telling me about Trinidad music again and we were listening to it, then she told me that she wants to teach me to dance Trinidadian.  She told me that it's all about shakin the hips.  I guess I'll have to work on my hips.  She told me about some songs she's going to try to get on cd for me to listen to because they're "real nice" and I can learn to dance to them.  Charmaine is so funny.  You should meet her sometime if you haven't already. Then she started dancing in the car all Trinidadian like and I laughed at her and she told me that I always look at her like she's old and crazy, and that she's not old and crazy.  Good times in the car with Charmaine.  Besdies that, on a completely different note, I feel like there was once this person who I was friends with and now, I don't even think they care that we don't really talk, and when we do it's pretty ackward.  But knowing me and the fact that I have no balls to say anything, I'm sure things will continue as they are and I'll just get more and more frustrated, but oh well.  It's just annoying I suppose.  Well, now it's 8:20, and I feel a little bit like going to bed.  Maybe I'll go do that.  Adios.    I stole this song from Tash, but I really like the lyrics, so today, you get a whole song~   *~There's something about the look in your eyes Something I noticed when the light was just right It reminded me twice that I was alive And it reminded me that you're so worth the fight My biggest fear will be the rescue of me Strange how it turns out that way Could you show me dear...something I've not seen? Something infinitely interesting There's something about the way you move I see your mouth in slow motion when you sing More subtle than something, someone contrives Your movements echo that I have seen the real thing Your biggest fear will be the rescue of you Strange how it turns out that way Could you show me dear...something I've not seen? Something infinitely interesting~Incubus*I stole this quiz from Tyler...    I am Celeborn, King of Lothlorien. During the War of the Ring, I succeeded in leading my forces in the conquest of Dol Guldur. People say I'm just Galadriel's pretty-trophy husband, but REALLY I'm the strong-and-silent type. In the movie, I'm played by Marton Csokas.  ||  urlLink Which Lord of the Rings Elf are you?  @  urlLink Xirculo.com  ||    Today was so uneventful, but I came to a realization.  When I put up my guard around someone I get so sarcastic, it's not good.  I defiently saw myself doing it today and I was like woah...thats bad.  Besides that I took a nap...and not much else happened.  I have to go read for history.  Sorry that my blogs have not been so enthusiastic and interesting, I've been really tired and I think I might have mono.    *~So here I am, alive at last and I will savor every moment of it, savor every moment of it.~The Used*Well today in school, Abe Lincoln came to visit my history class.  It was good times, Mr. Clarke just gets crazier and crazier.  Walking to english in the portable Carly pushed the door so hard to go outside and it hit this girl right in the face. It was so funny, but must have hurt that girl so much.  She nailed her in the face.  Anyways..drivers ed I learned to use seat belts, and then I went to the Y.  Now I'm here, not doing homework, because frankly, I'm sick of homework, and of being a junior.  I'm being ansy...so I'm going to go do something, and I don't really have a quote for today.  Sorry!Sorry I haven't blogged for a while kids...shall I recap the weekend? Friday night Taylo slept over and Booth came to play with us for a while.  Then I broke Taylo, but it was by accident..I didn't mean to. But I think she's getting better.  Anyways after Booth forced us to watch football we realized we really liked it, and that we are going to start following it.  Then, we slept.  Saturday I woke up, sat around with Taylo for a really long time, then went to Mr. Kleins funeral, then went to GIGA, and then Bren Taylo and I set off for the night.  George joined us and we went to Post Road Diner, then we got Katie Baldwin and went Extreme Bowling.  SO fun.  But the best part was when I completely wiped out in the lane.   The four surrounding teams of bolwers thought it was really funny too and laughed a lot at me.  But whatever, I laughed too.  Then Tony and Tash came to visit and then we were done.  And I came home and slept.  This morning I woke up and went to church, then a leaders meeting, and then Keith and I rented Glory for history and speed watched it.  Now I'm putting off my other homework and waiting for Holy Ground. But I should go say bye to my sister cause she's leaving for school.  Bye Bye mis amigos.    *~And now I finally see that the further we go, we're only treadin ground that we already know...~Saves the Day*Hey kids....Most of you know this already, but Julie had a miscarage, and so if anyone actually reads this please pray for her and Chip, they really need it.  I don't really have anything to post because I'm really sad right now.  Maybe later.    *~And I find peace when I'm confused, I find hope when I'm let down not in me, but in You.  I hope to lose myself for good, I hope to find it in the end..Not in me, it's You, it's all I know~Switchfoot*Today we had a debate in history, and it was intense. But I didn't get to say much because Mike was really hard core because he's the debate team captain, but I suppose thats alright.  Other then that it was SO cold today, and I didn't even know what to do with myself.   I am very ready for summer.  I thought of something exciting to say earlier but I forgot it, sorry.  I think I might have to start studying for mid-terms soon...just a crazy idea.  I'm not really stressed about them though, and in order to be motivated to study I need to be stressed.  Maybe tomorrow.  But for now I go study for history quiz tomorrow.  Bye bye.    *~ The sun comes up every morning and I'm grateful for another day to be alive.  And you konw what? If the sun never came up, we could all use a flashlight~* Just a nice little way to think of things :o)So...I feel like I have boring blogs now, but thats basically because my life has become very boring.  I'm sorry.  Today I had such an easy day, I'll explain it to you....Free first, no electricity or heat in portable second period = another free, french in the tech lab = playing on computer all period, algebra, free during lunch, sub in art = another free, history class to work on debate.  Wow, what a nice day.  I'm going to go eat ice cream now.    *~ And I know I'm making something out of this life they call nothing.  I take what I want, take what I need, you say it's wrong, but its right for me I wont look down, wont say I'm sorry.  I know that only God can judge me~Good Charlotte*Just got home from Okemo...so much fun.  Especially this afernoon with Taylor, Mark, Steven, and Bryan.  I think it was the most fun snowboarding I've ever had.  So thank you to those people who helped make that possible.  Now, I am tired and a bit cranky, and I a going to bed.  More about Okemo later.  Night night.   PS~ Tash, I love you so much.    *~In open fields of wild flowers, she breathes the air and flies away.  She thanks her Jesus for the daises and the roses in no simple language, someday she'll understand the meaning of it all.  He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens as close a heartbeat or a song on her lips.  Someday she'll trust Him and learn how to see Him, someday He'll call her and she will come running and fall in His arms and the tears will fall down...~Jars of Clay*They're done.  I don't even know how I'm alive, but I am very relieved.  I don't have much to blog though.  But I must say, I am very disappointed in all you out there who own blogs and don't ever write in them.  Poor little neglected blogs, it's like child abuse.  Go blog you bad people you.  Now I go and enjoy no stress and a 3 day weeekend.    *~ From you one look, just one look and everything is shattered...~Remy Zero*I want to die....AP History and Physics exam tomorrow, please kill me and quickly.  I have to go drown myself in books and try to learn all this stuff that I don't know.  I want to die.    Mike Shannon on the subject of history~   MrClown260:  yea seriously, our country was founded by religious zealots, war mongers, and opium addicts  MrClown260:  :-D I can't wait for what the future bringsSo I decided what I'm going to do with my life today.  Solve world hunger.  I know, it sounds a little crazy, but I have a plan.  I'm going to go to college, have a double major- journalism and business, and a minor in international affairs.  Now let me explain.  The Journalism major wil go along with the international affairs minor so that I can go to all these places where people starve and  write articles about them, and understand whats going on in these countries so that so many people are starving.  The business major is so that I can start a company like World Vision, that will support missions to places like and bring them food and all that stuff.  So, I decided all of this instead of studying.  But hey, at least now I have direction in my life.  -PeaceHmmm, you ever have that feeling where things aren't bad, but you just want things to change? Or your just waiting for something new to come along...but it doesn't? Yeah, thats basically how I've felt for like 3 months, and I'm really restless for some reason.  I just want something new to happen, but I don't really know what.  I'm just bored with how things are now.    I spent all of today studying for midterms, and then got in a fight with my mom.  Oh well.  I'm not really stressed about midterms, but I feel like I should be.  I probably will be freaking out Thursday night because Friday I have AP History and Physics.  Shoot me.  But once they're done it will feel SO nice.  Ok well I'm gonna go bumb around looking for something to do. -PeaceMilford last night was awesome.  Now, I study, lots and lots and lots, and want to die.  But hey, it's only one week.  So today I made my first college visit appointment.  Scary, but also exciting...I'm getting excited for college, which I guess is a little too early considering I'm still a junior.  Oh well.  Ok well I have to go study some more french business, then some algebra, then some history, then finish my english project.  Yay for school!    Ok this song is probably the cutest song ever, thanks Sarah Lecueyer :o)   *~ As I lay here in bed, your smile fills my head and I'm using this pen to talk to you, from a southern way. It's been weeks since I've seen you last. Time away from you Ain't movin too fast.  Wishin my summer away, just to see you again. I'm there by your side, looking in your eyes. Seeing you with me, what else could there be?  If I could get away, I would be there today. You'd be wearing that smile, haven't seen for awhile~ Pat McGee Band*I took it again and cheated because I wanted to see the Frodo one....

I laughed so much.   All the midterms have been returned, I did ok, except for the whole 64 on physics...but then again, it's physics.  This weekend is Middle School Okemo trip, I am quite excited.  I think now I will go do history homework, and possibly start the paper thats due Friday, oh the possibilites.  - Peace  *~You don't do it on purpose but you make me shake, now I count the hours til you wake with your babies breath, breathe symphonies, come on sweet catastrophe.  Well maybe this time I can follow through I can feel complete stop paying dues stop the rain from falling keep my oceans calm, this time I know nothings wrong~ Something Corporate (SO GOOD!!!!)*I stole this from my sister, but I'm better because I didn't have to cheat to get arrow boy...we're meant to be.     urlLink     Who is your Ideal Lord of the Rings (male) Mate?     brought to you by  urlLink QuizillaToday Sarah and I went to Krispy Kream in Milford, it was so good.  Tonight I watched a behind the sceens on 16 Candles....good times, unfortunatley our once hearthrob Jake is now living in Pennsylvania as a carpenter.  Oh well.  Thats all for now kids.    I don't really have a quote...oh well :o)This weekend has been quite good so far.  Friday night I went to Fujis with Taylor, Booth, and George.  Then we dropped Booth off at Arties and decided to go get a movie.  While we were movie getting Tash called with Tony, and she and Brian Kelly came to my house to watch the movie with us.  Then Tash picked up Bryan McCaffery, and Caroline Riley and Jess Van Sciver, the silly little freshman girls, and then Bryan Stinchfield showed up, and then Tony.  Haha, I'm not sure how that many people got there...anyways we all watched High Fidelity, but I got frustrated because I couldn't hear and I've never seen it before so I gave up on watching it.  Then of course Taylo slept over.  Saturday....I went to the Y, good times getting buff, then GIGA, which was super as always, and then watched Life As A House, the best movie EVER, with Bren and Christine.  Yesterday, I went to Church, then the leaders meeting, then home, and hung out with Katie Bennett, which was good times because I don't get to see her much, but I love her.  Then Holy Ground, which was awesome as always.  Off to the Super Bowl party where the Buccanners (my assigned team by Taylo) killed the Raiders (Taylos assigned team by Taylo) and it was good times.  Especially skating on the ice.  Now...I'm off to the Y again, I'm sorry because that was probably the most boring blog ever.     *~Be joyful always~1 Thes. 5:16*So today while I was waiting for my mom to be ready to take me to my practice sat business, I was reading old posts from my blog and I laughed at some of them...and then I was like, when did my life get boring? Because it used to seem excitng, at least a little bit but now its boring, oh well.  I had really good Vavalas today, and GIGA tonight, I love Saturdays.  My quote is from a song that Taylor told me about, that I've never actually heard, but I like the lyrics.  -Peace  *~My best friend's always near me, cheers me, looking after me.  I need her and it's clear to see, my best friend's always near me. Enjoy this as long as we should be.  With only her, my life it could be my friend, knows why hen I've lost track we'll never cry, we'll always laugh.  For a stop and go and I know we would my friend's always by my side~ Down by Law*I'm feeling mucho better today....I think I just had a big dose of self pity, then realized that thats stupid, and got over it.  I catch myself looking for fulfilment in things on earth, and then I realize that I'm never going to find it in anything here, because nothing here is perfect.  So I had some good time with God last night and this morning and it brought me back to feelin good and happy.  I really don't think I could ever express how amazing God is.  I've realized more and more that times when I get sad or lonely or whatever it's totally God pulling me back to him.  Now I am back to him, and its so good.  The snow day is beautius, and I'm going to go play in it with Wil Sorenson.  Much love.3 big fat cheers for snowdays.So heres my emotional spheel.  I've been sad for like the past 2 days, and I finally realized what it is.  I go through these periods when I realize how much I miss the kids that are all at college, and how much they mean to me.  When they were here, as in last year, besides just being my best friends, they were kind of like my protectors and big people that took care of me when I messed up or was sad.  They were just always there, and I love them so much, and I know they're still there for me but it's so hard to not have them here all the time.  I miss so much having those people who I could just go to, and who knew me so well, and knew when something was wrong, and as strange as it sounds, they basically just took care of me.  But now they're gone, and I'm the older kid now, and most my friends are younger, or my age, and I guess it's just hard to have to be the big older kid.  I guess this week I've had a lot on my mind and usually when I'm like this the older kids are the ones I go to, but I can't because they're not here, and with everyone here, I guess I know they care but I still feel like I'm burdening them with whatever...so I don't feel like I have anyone I can talk to and it just is hard sometimes.  I mean I love my friends that I have now, but I guess in some ways I feel like they all have something better, and I'm kinda left out with nothing.  It's probably not the reality of things, but thats how it feels right now...and it sucks.  I just don't really feel secure in anything, and I don't know who really cares and I'm always scared that I care so much more for someone then they care about me.  So for those of you who were wondering what was wrong...there ya go.  Sorry if you asked and I didn't tell you, I'm not really good at the whole sharing thing, until it basically is just going to explode out of me.  I think it just did.    *~"Hold on, if you feel like letting go.  Hold on, it gets better than you know.  Don't stop looking, you're one step closer.  Don't stop searching, it's not over.  Hold on." ~Good CharlotteI'm kinda in a "rut" I guess you could say.  I've been in a blah mood for like 3 days, it's kinda annoying.  Stupid little things get me down.  Oh well, I will get out of it soon enough...I like this song, it's very girly, and sappy, but ya know what? It's my blog.    *~You light me up and then I fall for you You lay me down and then I call for you Stumbling on reasons that are far and few I'd let it all come down and then some for you   Pretty baby don't you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin' around, oh pretty baby   And I know things can't last forever But there are lessons that you'll never learn Oh, just the scent of you, it makes me hurt So how's it you that makes me better   Pretty baby don't you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin' around, oh pretty baby   Why can't you hold me and never let go When you touch me, it is me that you own Pretty baby, oh the place that you hold in my heart Would you break it apart again, oh pretty baby   Pretty baby don't you leave me I have been saving smiles for you Pretty baby why can't you see You're the one that I belong to I'll be the embrace that keeps you warm For you're the sun that breaks the storm I'll be alright and I'll sleep sound As long as you keep comin' around, oh pretty baby ~ Vanessa Carlton*I was reading my old blog...and I found this post, and it made me laugh, and remember last year.  So I'm going to post it here.  I got sad reading it because all these people are so far away and its crazy how different things are now.  I miss these people so much, and I love them, it's really hard to explain, but I miss them so much.     June 2, 2002   Look! I'm posting!!! YAY! Thats exciting. Today, I went to church ce matin and then I went to bible study, one after another. Lots of time at church, but both were good. I got home and Amanda had called, so I went over to her house and hung out. Wes and Pete were swimming and Kyle and I went out to visit them and then Kyle tried to push me in the pool, I don't really remember what happened but I know that I was almost in the pool and thinking about how badly I didn't want to go in, so I grabbed onto the closest thing, which just happened to be Kyles hair. I was pulling it so hard just trying to not fall in, and then I realized that it was Kyles hair, and it probably was hurting her, so I pulled extra hard to get up and ran past her inside. She ran in after me and told the boys so Kyle, Matt and Goat grabbed me and with much effort (because I'm huge and put up a good fight) threw me into the pool. Wasn't that nice. Later when I took my shorts off to put them in the dryer Goat stole them and the boys procceeded to play catch with them in the pool, Matt even put them on. Then Goat threw them into the Gallos yard. So I had to walk soaking wet with no shorts over to the Gallos to get my shorts. Don't my friends love me. Out of love I have for my friends, I'm using Amanda as my quote for the day.  *~Can you ask them to get a towel and do it on the floor?~Amanda*This basically sums up my feelings at the moment  *~Pardon me while I throw up, I guess some people never grow up. What happened to the salvation that you claimed? It breaks my heart to see how much you've changed.~ Relient K*Wow, it's been so long since I blogged! Sorry kids....Okemo this weekend was so much fun.  Those middle school kids are so cute, but I am so glad that I am no longer in middle school.  I would like to just add that I am so proud of Taylor, because she did the rainbow rail! Good job Taylor, unlike myself, Taylor is a very talented snowboarder...she grinds the rainbow rail....I fall off a jump and almost die, you see the difference? Today, I had a driving lesson with Giovanni, it was quite entertaining.  I think he might have been high, but he was so funny.  Yeah, school wise I had 3 frees in a row, that was nice.  Then I came home and was talking to Artie, and he had just made muffins, and invited me and George to come have some, and being the fat kid I am, I went across town and had some quite yummy muffins.  Now, I am taking a homework break.  And there is the exciting story of my life.  Todays quote comes from Giovanni.    *~Yeah, at the stop sign you have to make sure that that thing that happens at stop lights, ya know where you move forward a little bit, that has to happen.  I don't know, it's got somethin to do with the laws of physics I think.~Giovanni on stop signs and physics*HAPPY VALENTINES DAY! I hope you all are having a fabulous day, and if you're one of those people who gets all sad or whatever because you don't have a boyfriend or girlfriend, don't be! Because Valentines Day does not have to be about that, it's about loving your friends in general.  SO get over it and buy someone a box of chocolate! But don't be like Taylor and do that, then eat it.  Today in physics Matt (the faithful lab partner) carved "I love Meggie" and "Meggie Rox" into the desk.  He's going to get me in trouble with the teacher or something.  My brother and his friend Will are sitting next to me playing video games and they just got into a fight about that cheerleading song and whether or not its "Like totally for sure, I just got a manicure." or "Like totally for sure, I think I need a manicure"  I think that makes them big fat losers.  But at least they're entertaining.    Well we're finally on vacation...and I'm really excited, I think it's going to be good.  For starters Taylor and I are getting together and watching Moulin Rouge, so I'm going to go get ready for that.  First, by taking advil, because I just played with little kids for 2 and a half hours, and yes, it made my head hurt.  Peace out .  *~This is My commandment: Love one another, just as I have loved you. Greater love has no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends.~John 15:12-13~*Good day turned bad turned good.  Thats the way to go.  I know that I quoted Taking Back Sunday 2 days ago, but this line from this song, that Taylo and I are sitting here listening to is making me think of my day.  Theres 2 parts of it that I will quote.   Make that 3.   *~The truth is you could slit my throat and with my one last gasping breath I'd apologize for bleeding on your shirt~* *~These grass stains on my knees they won't mean a thing~* *~You're a touch overated, you're a lush and I hate it~*  ~All compliments of "You're so Last Summer" by Taking Back Sunday :o)Plan detox begins today.  I'm quite excited.  Taylo and Bren know what I'm talking about, it's gone on long enough! Oh man, I'm so excited for 2 weeks from now.  I'm hyper right now....an hour of SAT tutoring, and then homework makes me a little ancy.  I just thought it was important to mark the start of plan detox in my beloved blog.  Adios!   *~And you never would have though in the end how amazing it feels just to live again, it's a feeling that you cannot miss~The Used*Yay for half days.  Snow is so pretty when it first falls, I enjoy it very much.  I got new binders and pencils from Staples today, and got quite excited about them too because I'm a big fat dork.  But hey, it's ok.  I just read Tylers blog, and I want to start a scrapbook now.  It's quite a good idea.  Maybe once I'm not lazy I will.  So Taylor and I made a decision, we're going to wax our legs, we figured that we don't really shave as it is (sorry if this is too much information for any of you out there).  But yeah, we're going to go together and get it done.  Thats my exciting news of the day.  I have a headache so I'm going to go watch tv.  -Peace   *~Why can't I feel anything for anyone other than you. Hoping for the best just hoping nothing happens.  A thousand clever lines unread on clever napkins , I will never ask if you don't ever tell me. I know you well enough to know you never loved me, and all of this was all your fault.  And all of this...I stay jealous, I stay wrecked and jealous for this, for this simple reason I just need to keep you in mind as something larger than life.  She'll destroy us all before she's through and find a way to blame somebody else~Taking Back Sunday* hahahahahahaToday was a bueno day.  Church and the lead meeting were super, then George called when I got home and we drove to the mall and got Wetzel Pretzels, and saw everyone and their mom there, but it was fun.  Then we called Booty to see if he was home because we wanted to visit, but he was at Post Road Diner with Andrew and Artie, so we stopped by there to visit, and they were all getting fat eating really big meals.  Hathaway decided to smear his all over his face too.  Holy Ground was super as always, and now my dad "wants to talk to me for a minute" I think it's going to be a little more then a minute.  Oh, the other funny part of the day, I got in the car after the Lead meeting and my dad goes "I like you the way you are when we're drivin in the car" Yes, my 66 year old dad was singing Avril Lavigne.  Oh boy.  A Dios!   *~Now I've got a peace of mind, there's just no better way. And if I should die tonight, that would be alright. I'm gonna try real hard, no matter what it takes and even if I fail. I know that when life's done, and I'm accounted for, I lived it to the full.~Hangnail*Tonight I saw the Life of David Gale....it was rated R, but George, Taylor and I got in, and so did Kait, but shes 17.  I felt quite good to get in and not be carded.  Then, possibly one of the funniest things I've ever seen happened.  We were all seated, and the lights were dimming as the movie began, and some late comers came in and got in the row behind us, the last guy, who I guess his friends made move to the inside was scooting along the aisle with a bag of popcorn, and gets bumped, and dumps half of his bag of popcorn on Taylors head.  It was so funny. Oh man, I'm laughing now thinking about it.  Other then that this woman in the row in front of us was bitter and yelled at us like 79476549 times for having our feet on the seat...and George pointed out at the end that she was probably just bitter because her boyfriend was a loser.  Probably.  He was short.    *~I have no quote today~*Actions speak lowder then words....I have to keep that in mind.  Besides that, I have to go take a shower, because, I have not done that yet today, and it's a good idea.I had to ditch Taylor today, and get my legs waxed...her hair just wasn't growing.  She was a little upset with me but it's all good now.  And I'm smooooth.  Babysat Wil for 5 hours, I love the kid, but yeah,  5 hours with any 2 year old is quite a long time.  What else....SAT stuff, yeah, boring.  Hmmm, oh just some clarification, I'm not exactly excited about prom yet, but Bren got me all thinking about who to go with and that stuff....that makes me anxious, and I don't want to think about it.  Yeah.  Anyways,  I was supposed to go to dinner with my mom tonight, but she ditched me.  Who gets ditched by their mom? Apparently I do.  Oh well.  - Peace  *~And if you were with me tonight, I'd sing to you one last time.  A song for a heart so big, God wouldn't le it live.  May angels lead you in, hear you me my friends. On sleepless roads the sleepless go, may angels lead you in...~Jimmy Eat World*Wow, I had a busy day today...but it felt good to be productive.  Now I'm home, and tired, but I have to read like 30 text book pages for history...maybe I'll do that tonight.  But probably not.  So, I got girly, and I didn't want to, but I started thinking about prom.  Now, I'm all anxious like.  But whatever, I'll get over it.  I wish I hadn't started thinking about it.  Other then that, break has been good.  Relaxing, but productive.  This is going to be a short blog, because I don't really have anything exciting to post, sorry.    *~This is the closest to this friend that I've been, I hope you find it on greener ground and bluer skies, I hope you don't think less of me if I'm cold I don't want to watch you go~Get up Kids*   PS~ Taylor says "Tell your blogger fans I say 'hi', actually 'hey' no wait, 'yo', actually, 'salutations', no, 'howdy'......Actually, tell them I say all of them"Taylo and I had so much fun being snowed in today.  We made Shepards pie that was SO good, and ran to Hathaways to get a beef bullion, that was funny.  Then we tried to make a fort, but it was SOOO bad, we failed miserably, but laughed about it.  Then Taylor went home and I took a nap.  Had good conversation with Tash and Katie.  Now, I'm bored again.  Yeah, by the way, in case you didn't know its probably one of the worst feelings in the world when you're waiting for someone to call you and then you call them and they made plans with other people and didn't even bother to let you know.  But whatever, I'm going to go watch Everwood.  *~He can make me happy          (It's a long silent peace)  And I will only love him          (It'a a weakness in your knees)  And I will never look down  Down is where we came from          (It's a perfect place to go for everlasting love)  Because it's all in the past          (Nothing to fear, nothing to hide)  He took a load off my chest          (You just say what's on your mind)          (Needn't think before you speak)  Ooh cause it's not happy          (This is how it's meant to be)  Cause I had needed his help          (Never high, never fall)  No matter how by myself          (You can do no wrong at all)  I am going nowhere          (In this heaven up above filled with everlasting love)  And now I'm changing my plans  Because we only live once  Ooh could be this happy  Once, I could live by his side~Guster*Today was mucho fun...First Taylor...or should I say, Waldo, woke up and watched "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitters Dead" quality entertainment if you were wondering.  Then, we were about to do pilates and Julie called, and said she'd be at my house in 20 minutes to pick us up for our Valentines Day party shopping and so we had to shower super fast and be ready.  There was an amusing experience that happened when Waldo was showering, but I don't think I'll tell it because it'll probably just sound weird...but it was so funny.  Anyways, we shopped and then met all the other girls and went to Wilton for some good ol' fashion cookie making and bible study.  Good times.  Afterwards Bren, Waldo, and I went to Barnes and Nobles and got good books.  Headed to the wrestling FCIACs and saw some good moves, and you'll never guess who we saw.  Ok, I'll tell you.  Bren and I saw HOT KID FROM CANCUN!!!!! I'm not kidding you folks, it was crazy to see him.  Then to Hathaways, where we watched a movie, one that made me particulary jumpy.  The end was lame though.  Now I'm home....Did I mention how happy I am that we're on break? Because I am.    So Taylor got me into this song that I'm listening to right now...and it's so cute.  Makes me want a boyfriend though...bad news.  Oh well, I'm going to qoute it, the lyrics are a guy singing to a girl, and maybe...one day...a guy will write a song like this for me.  Haha...what a silly girly thing to think, haha.    *~I look at her and have to smile, as we go driving for a while.  Looking nowhere in the open window of my car, and as we go the traffic lights.  Watch them glimmer in her eyes, in the darkness of the evening.  And I've got all that I need, right here in the passenger seat.  Oh and I can't keep my eyes on the road, knowing that she's inches from me...~Stephen Speaks*  :o)I just have to get this out.....EW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thats the only way to describe it, and that felt good.  Night.I've had 2 songs stuck in my head all day, and I think I'll tell you what they are.  First, the song that goes "Little Italy eh, chingity ching eh on eh on, the Italian Christmas donkey..." yeah you know, kinda strange though, considering it's not Christmas.  The second, is only one line, but it won't go away, I even said it to the man at the bank today, "Holla back youngin".  These two songs have just been going through my head, back and forth back and forth.  Crazy.Ahhh, I'm not in a very good mood, pre registration was so frustrating, on top of the fact that I might not even be here next year.  Yeah, boo.  Anyways, I had sushi for dinner and it was good.  I should be studying for my history test right now, but it's going to suck anyways.  Well, isn't this a depressing blog, I might as well add that we are about to enter my least favorite month of the year, March.  Blah.    *~I guess that I'm wrong for fallin in love, but you're still the one that I'm dreamin of.  Well I guess that it's you, I want to hold on to but you're holding on to someone else~ Ataris*We had a field trip to the city today for AP History, it was quite fun.  But we had Chinese Buffet for lunch, man, it was SO bad, then when I was going to throw out my basically untouched plate, this guy that had been begging for money came up and took it from me, so at least he got a big meal.  To make up for it though Mr. Clarke took us to this really good pastery place in Little Italy, yeah, I enjoyed that.  Then, getting on the subway back, when we were getting on Mr. Clarke realized that we were missing Tess and Mr. Baldwin who was chaperoning, and ran back to find them, so our class rode the subway alone, and missed our train, but it was an adventure.  All the girls talked about prom, I don't like to think about prom, it's so stressful to be all like "Who am I going to go with?" so, I'm not going to think about it.  Other then that, I'm really tired, and I think I blog too much, no one else seems to.  Oh well.  I enjoy it.    *~This is my voice,all shadows stayed, this is my heart, upon the altar laid.  Please take,all else away, hear my cry, I beg, I plead, I pray.  I'll walk, into the flame, a calculated risk to further bless your name.  So strike me deep and true and in your strengh I will live and die both unto you~Thrice*Today in physics, Matt (the faithful lab partner) and I got in a little fight.  First, I took his pencil, then he stole my worksheet, and turned it into a paper airplane.  So I asked Mr.Marrash for another one and showed him what Matt had done to mine, and he told Matt that if he was going to do that he might as well have made it a good one.  Then, I took out my green marker, and drew on Matts arm, well let me tell you, I've never seen someoen get so sassy about a little green marker, so he stole the cap to my marker and started to shove paper in it so I wouldn't be able to put the cap back on my marker and it would dry out.  This went on for quite a while...we had lab, so 2 periods of it, then he gave me my cap back and just to let him know that I own him I had to take out my purple marker and draw on him again.  Well didn't he get mad, he stole my green marker and drew all over me.  Anyways, be the end of lab I had marker all over me, and had learned nothing.  Besides that, today was quite usual.  I made muffins when I got home, those were good.  Hmmmm, nothing else.  Adios.    *~ I'm takin you to Italy we're gonna sail to Rome, if we find Hawaii then we'll make that our home.  I'm takin you to London then we'll backpack to France.  Leave this town again without you? There ain't a chance.~Stephen Speaks* :o)Allllll resolved, God is so good, all the time.Aaaah sometimes stuff sucks, especially when people don't understand you.  I'm not bitter or angry or jealous or anything, just hurt, and I know that when I get hurt by someone I don't show it and I just deal with it in my own way, and apparently I'm being "cold".  I'm not resentful, I just need time, and if thats coming across as me being cold, or not hurt or angry then I'm sorry.  It's hard when you don't feel like you can trust your best friend.  But no one seems to understand that, so I guess I'll just deal with it all on my own.    *~Bear with each other and forgive whatever grievances you may have against one another.  Forgive as the Lord forgave you.  And over all these virtues put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity~Colossians 3:13*Wow, I'm really sick of being lied to, but I guess thats just how people are.  I just wish people would be honest with me, it'd make things a lot better.  Oh well, I'll just deal with it.    *~I'm only pretty sure that I can't take this anymore. I wonder what we are fighting for, when I say out loud, 'I want to get out of this." I wonder, is there anything that I'm going to miss? I wonder how it's going to be when you don't know me? How it's going to be when you're sure I'm not there? How it's going to be when there's no one there to talk to, between you and me, I don't care.~Third Eye Blind*Last night was much fun....the volleyball game was very entertaining, and what I saw of The Bourne Identity I enjoyed.  Then Taylo slept over, and it was nice.  Now, I believe I'm going to make some egg whites for lunch, ooooooh yum.  PS, if you see Julie Valandra today, give her a hug or something, it's her birthday.  What a short blogblog.  Oh yeah, it's also really sunny out, thats nice.  Anything else? I don't think so....maybe I should go now, because I feel like this might be painful for the people reading it.  haha sometimes I amuse myself, Peace out.    *~I'm growing up again...I'm learning to accept that all good things must come to an end.I'm growing up again...I'm trying to understand what it's like to let go of a friend.~The Ataris*Good song right here folks, these are only part of the lyrics...  *~When the night seems so long (throw your hands to the sky)  You can sing a new song (wipe the tears from your eyes)  When you're weak, He is strong  He can heal your wounded soul  and calm the storm inside   For all your times of laughter  In every hopeful prayer  When the world weighs on your shoulders  Through sorrow and your despair  With everything, with every breath, praise the Lord~Third Day*I am dying an inevitable, slow, painful death. There is nothing your or I can do about it. My throat is swelling, and will soon close, cutting of air circulation, and my nose is running a constan marathon, while also becoming a breathing blockade. My legs feel like noodles, well done noodles at that.  When the two of these merge, along with the inevitable inability to walk, death is invetiable. While some may say what I am suffering is a common "cold" I know that it is not. It is much, much more. It was nice knowing you. Maybe I should write my will....what do you want from me? Please let me know before breathing becomes too much of a strugle and I am weak to conjure breath to continue life.   I have 2 quotes of the day, because first, I was reading my old blog, and I found a post about one of the funniest things that I've ever done, and so I'll post that little bit, then a song quote.  I will probably never see you again, so have a nice life.    "Guess what I just did? I burnt my face with a lean cuisine. OWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Someone should have told me that i'm not capable of talking on the phone and making microwave food, but they didn't. And I dropped the lean cuisine and it splattered on my face. OUCH!!!!! I even have a burn, its a little blister under my eye" -Meggies old blog...oh I amuse myself, that hurt so much though.    *~Everything happens for a reason is no reason not to ask myself if I am livin it right~John Mayer~*Today was better then yesterday.  But I'm sick, oh well. Anyways in Physics Mr. Marrash told like a 20 minute long joke, with the dumbest punch line ever.  But at least it was 20 minutes of non-physics.  Other then that I went to the doctor, and my sister got me Vavalas because she loves me.  I think now, I do homework.  Peace out.I wish I could do something to remove what's hurting you and leave only a smile in its place, but that isn't what either of us need.  You will learn from this.  It won't kill you.  If life were going to do that, it would already have accomplished its task.  Instead, you will suffer.  You will hurt.  You will endure more than you could have ever imagined and you will grow.  These moments will leave scars and those scars will in turn fade in time, but they will only make you more beautiful because anyone can be foolish and young but wisdom can only be acquired through experiences that transform us, that forge our personalities in blast furnaces and cauterize our wounds.  Someday, we will all be whole and we will intuitively recognize each other - not as we are or appear, but as we are meant to be.  Tyler is awesome.This part of this song expalins a lot of how I feel right now,  I don't like being all self-pity and crap like that, but it would be nice if just one thing was gong well.  Whatever, it'll all get better eventually.    *~And it feels like I'm at an all-time low , slightly bruised and broken from our head on collision. I've never seen this side of you, another tragic case of feeling bruised and broken from our head on collision. I've never seen this side of you another tragic case, another tragic case of feeling bruised and broken another tragic case, and I've been still waiting for a good day still waiting for a good day~New Found Glory*Ok, so heres the low down on Minneapolis, Minnesota.  I decided to make a list.  First, we'll start with the positives, then the things that I personally found just a little strange, then the negatives.   Positives~  1.  The city is really pretty, not very big, but nice.   2.  Even though it's really cold in the winter, it doesn't get cloudy, it's like always sunny, just freezing.  3.  The kids I met were nice, even though they were a bit Minnesotan . Ok..well those are all the positivies I can think of for the moment....maybe more later.    Strange Things~  1.  It's so cold in the winter that in the city they have sky walks between all the buildings so that you can basically get anywhere in the city without having to go outside.  It's like a big hampster cage or something.  2.  All the people are that super friendly that kinda creeps me out, like they're all actually about to explode and kill someone.   3.  The kids that I met last night, they have this saying, where they say "Oh you totally tweeked" or "She's tweeking"  I have yet to figure out exactly what this means.   4.  There are about 8239047459860 lakes in Minnesota, on their license plates it says "10,000 lakes" and the lakes freeze in the winter because it's like -30 (maybe not really but thats what it feels like) and for fun, people DRIVE THEIR CARS on the frozen lakes.  And I thought there was nothing to do in Darien.    Negatives~  Basically, the city is nice, and I'm sure the people who live here like it, but it's not home and it's not the people I love.  And it wasn't until I left home that I missed the comforts I didn't even know I had, and the people I didn't know kept me alive.  I don't think that I would fit in so well in Minnesota, I don't say things like "dont'cha know" and "tweek" and I'm not super peppy all the time.  Oh, and just in case you were wondering, in the midwest, sweatshirts, and straight legged jeans never went out of style, netiher did mullets.    Anyways, thats the low down on Minnesota.  I have to go now because I have to visit 2 schools before I finally come home.  Bye bye.    *~Spinnin, laughin, dancin to her favorite song.  She's a little girl with nothing wrong, and she's all alone.  Eyes wide open always hoping for the sun, and she'll sing her song to anyone that comes along~Norah Jones*So I just talked to my mom about this nanny trauma...and she told me that I was forgetting one of them...apparently when we first moved to Delaware, I had a midget for a nanny...but they had to fire her because I was that age where I ran around a lot, and according to my mom "Not only was she short, but she was heavy" and couldn't keep up with me.  Anyways...I just had my last driving hours, yay! During the practice driving test my instructor was so funny when he was telling me what to do on the real test.  He earns the quote of the day.    *~Blinker the crap out of them~Silly driving man with the thick accent*Tonight was really fun....I had a nice dinner with my dad and had a really good conversation with him, I know he's an old man and everyone think's he's just crabby and crazy, and he may well be...he's my daddy and I love him.  It was a really nice talk.  Then Bren came over, and we talked to my dad about my old nannies, and I've had nannies since I was born, and I'm starting to think they're the reason I'm so weird. Can I just describe to you the few I remember?  We'll start with Ginny, she was my first nanny ever, and she was so nice, but I think her son was in the mafia....but whatever, I used to sleep over at her house when I was like 2, she was like a grandmother.  Next that I remember was Suzie, she was nice, but she had two boyfriends...Richard and Bill, she lived with Bill, and we would have sleepovers there, he had cats.  Richard worked at the bank, and apparently my dad said she had a third boyfriend in California.  This didn't all register with me.  Then I remember Lauren, she was nice, but she was so 90's...all about the work out videos and that stuff.  Next in my memory was short experience with "Aunt Kathy", this woman was not my aunt, she took me fishing once...I don't remember what happened to her.  Then, Marjena, she was Polish, had a little white car, spent a lot of time in the bathroom, had this hand lotion that smelled so bad, I can still remember the smell, and big purple frame glasses.  I remember once we were being loud in the car and she pulled over and said she wasn't driving again until we were quiet.  The last Delaware babysitter I remember was this girl that I made my mom hire because she looked like one of the girls on "The Round house" and I thought it would be cool to have her as a babysitter (mind you I was like 6), and she got fired, and stole my first pet ever, my goldfish.  Yeah, very sad.  Moving on to Connecticut babysitters....first was Barb, she was a hefty woman so to speak, and wouldn't let me touch her face because she said she never had a zit in her life and if I touched her face she'd get a zit.  I remember her coming home one night at like 4 in the morning...probably drunk, I think that ended Barb.  Then Kesha, she was really sweet, but then her husband Robert from Oregon moved in with us, then they decided to move back to Oregon, but I really liked Kesha.  Then there was this Australian woman, she hated us, it was funny.  She didn't last long, and after she was gone, we found a letter she had written home and saved on the computer about how much she hated us, that was funny.  I think next was Annette, she was from Trinidad, and nice, but kinda old and strict, she left to get married, and so then came Charmaine...and Charmaine I'm proud to say is still with us.  She is the best, she brings the flava...ask Taylor.  Anyways, maybe this gives some insight into why I'm a little on the weird side, look at the people that had a big part in raising me.  Yeah.... Anyways, tonight was really fun, read Tash and Brens blog to find out about it.  I'm tired and going to sleep....aaaah sleep. Yay! Night! :o)   *~I'm sick of being caught in yesterday~Ataris* (Thanks Tyler!)You know that feeling when something so good just suddenly goes away and you want it back really badly, but you can't ever have it back because people change, and things change, and it never goes back to what it used to be.  And sometimes you just want to go up to that person and ask if they even care....yeah, I have to get over that feeling.  I think it's time for my favorite Ataris song ever.....hahahahahahahahahahaha I'm so emotional, whatever, this is my blog, and I can be as emotional as I please :o)   *~You told me that you loved me, I started tearing down those walls. I really started to trust you but you set me up to take the fall. I guess I'm not prepared to say... Goodbye, so long, farewell, I won't be seeing you again Until next time that he goes away.  I guess that I'm wrong for falling in love, But you're still the one that I'm dreaming of. I guess that it's you I want to hold onto, But you're holding onto someone else~The Ataris*Why do I even worry? I'm all freakin out last night, and I open up my devotional and what does it say, "Relax I'm in control -God" Thanks God.  Then, I'm sitting here now, reading this little book of quotes I have, and this is the one I opened to and read.   Let me share...because God is just awesome.  "As the melody of our lives unfolds on a daily basis, the high point lies in the fact that God is never going to make a mistake with the motif that he's specifically designed us for.  Whatever he does will endure forever.  He brings out the beauty of harmony and richness as he directs every facet of our lives.  This fact gaurentees that all crises already have been met and overcome in him.  As we live, work, and bear our burdens, be assured that the melody of our lives is controlled by the eternal God of the universe who knows us from beginning to end" - Luci Swindoll.   Man, I really don't need to worry ever, God is so in control.  Other then that....my life is boring, and I have had an extremely dull week.  Haha.  Bye kids!!Am I moving to Minnesota or not? Please let me know.AHHHHH I just sat for like 5 hours...in addition to the 6 I already did at school.  I came home and went to drivers ed, then I had a practice sat, another 3 hours of sitting.  SO I'm a little on the wirey side.  Let me set up the drivers ed scene for you, it was me, and about 30 sophomores...it wouldn't be so bad if I had just been a slacker or something, but the truth is, these sophomores are older than me.  It's crap I tell you, crap.   In other news...I'm going to be honest with you blog readers out there, I'm listening to some Tim McGraw and Faith Hill right now...because, I have a little thing for sappy love songs/country, and this song is hittin the spot right about now, shall I seranade you a little "And now that we're together I'm stronger then ever..happy and free.  Oh it's a beautiful thing, don't think I can keep it in.  And if you ask me why I've changed I don't think I can keep it in.  It's your love, it does somethin to me, sends a shock right through me..." So on and so forth.  I think you get the picture.   So I'm going to return to my apples and peanut butter...taste a pretty nice, pretty nice.....  My quote is for Taylor today, because she was sick, and I made her laugh and it hurt her.... *~Fine...just go....catch a chicken~* hahahahaaGOATS HOME!!!!!!!!!!! Let me set up the situation for you....So here I am, over the garage, doing some stinky history homework, and then I hear my sister come home.  She walks in downstairs and is all "Meggie come here!" and I'm all "Why?" Thinking she's going to give me some chore or something like that.  So she's like "Fine don't come" and I feel bad, so I go downstairs, and she has the fridge open and says " Did you take out the trash?" and I said "I didn't know I was supposed to take out the trash" A little annoyed because who wants to be called all the way downstairs by their sister to take out the trash? Not me.  So imagine my suprise when she closes the fridge and there is no trash, but a Goat! Yaaaay, so that was my very happy experience of the day, and I thought I would share it with you  Other then that, church was really good this morning and so was the lead meeting.  I was just watching Winning London, yes that would be the Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen movie, and ya know what, they have the cutest boys in those movies, and both of them got cute boys.  I'll admit, I was jealous, where's my cute boy? I guess I have to be a super famous identica twin with my own clothing line to get one.  I'll work on that.  Hmmmm, I want summer.  I got summer anxious really badly today, and that is why I'm not doing my work right now.  Yep Yep.  Well, I think I'm done here.    My quote of the day is inspired by the fact that Tyler, Taylor and I are going to see Hot Rod Circuit in 12 days, VERY exciting.  :o)   *~ Lie awake, wondering,If things could have been much different.  Second chance, what's become of a friendship if you can call this one? Stayed in touch, stood behind, while I gave you space and you invade mine.  While everyone makes mistakes, you let me down for the last time, truth prevails and theres nothing you can hide. And I wash my hands of you, getting on with my life.~Hot Rod Circuit * (duh)I came home yesterday from babysitting...where I was til 5, and there was a car in my driveway.  I was perplexed, because it was a blazer, and no one I know drives a blazer.  So, I come inside and ask my sister who was here, she tells me that my friends came over and directs me over the garage.  I go over the garage, and there are George and Taylor, who had been here since school got out.  Quite interesting, considering that school had gotten out 2 and 1/2 hours ago.  Anways, we hung out and found some other kids throughout the evening.  Then George got in on some Taylo and ChubChub time because he slept over, but I got tired, and went to bed, so they had George and Taylo time, and it was nice.  THE THUNDER STORM WAS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just thought I should say that.  I love thunder storms.   Drivers ed this morning...no good, but license SO soon, good.  I think I'm blabbering? Maybe.  IT'S SO nice out right now, and HOT ROD CIRCUIT TONIGHT!!! WOOHOOO!!! I am excited.  Now, I go, and I don't know what, but this blog is not making sense.  So I believe I'm done here.  I think I said so a lot in this blog.  Oh well, it happens.    *~As I stand here and wait for you, you don't know how I feel.  Guess I'm too shy to let you know.  My heart's in control.  This time I know that everything will be okay.  I don't know what you would think.  I don't know what to expect.  No matter what happens you will be my friend.  I'm not going to mess this up.  I don't want to end with regrets.~Slick Shoes*Theres this group of kids that I suppose you would call the "hardcore" kids, and I don't have any problem with these kids, they all seem nice.  But, there is one problem.  They congregate every morning of every day for the past 2 years, and again this in and of itself is not a problem, but it becomes a problem when they congegate in front of MY locker.  Every freakin day theres like 20 of them, all leaning against or circling around my locker, which I only go to like once a day anyways.  So, I politely ask them to move, and they look at me like I'm crazy, but lets be honest, it's not a suprise I'm going to ask, I only do it EVERY DAY.  I don't know, but I've had it, these kids are gonna get it one day....You just wait.    *~These nights I get high just from breathing.  When I lie here with you I'm sure that I'm real, like that firework over the freeway. I could stay here all day but that's not how you feel. ~Something Corporate*Wow, it's amazing that when I'm so caught up in feeling bad for myself and having a pity party God kinda smacks me in the face and makes me realize how blessed I am.  Hearing that the Bakers house burnt down made me realize so quickly how much I have, and how quickly it can all be taken away.  Defiently teaches me not to take anything for granted, because God is amazing and I need to work on recognizing that more everyday.   Anyways, I guess all I can say is pray for the Bakers, because I can't even imagine what they're going through right now.    *~For all your times of laughter and every hopeful prayer, when the world weighs on your shoulders.  Your sorrow and your despair, with everything, with every breathe, praise the Lord..Let everything, let every breathe praise the Lord.~Third Day and Caemedons Call*I think I have the biggest crying hang over ever.  I'm going to go collapse and ignore life for a long time.Today was beautiful and awesome and I went for a run, which was so nice.  It was a fabulous day.    Tonight, I watched the presidents speech, and I started thinking about what it must be like for the people in Iraq who were listening to him, hearing that they were going to have war declared on them.  To have a leader like Saddam who kills anyone who apposes him, and has rape chambers and poision rooms to kill people, and torture chambers for anyone he thinks has turned against him.  It's really just unimaginable and I've been thinking a lot today about how blessed I am to live where I live, and that it really is such an amazing blessing, because I have more then so many of those Iraqi people could even imagine, and for no other reason besides that this is the life I was born into.  What if I was born in Iraq? I can't even imagine what it would be like to hear what they heard tonight or to live the lives they live, always being scared of getting killed or beaten or tortured.  I guess it just puts a lot of stuff into serious perspective and makes me realize how much I already have, and that I need to realize that more before always wanting more.  So I guess all thats left to do is pray like crazy.    Thats my spheel of the night, because thats what I was thinking about.      *~The salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord; he is their stronghold in time of trouble.  The Lord helps them and delivers them; he delivers them from the wicked and saves them because they take refuge in him~Psalm 37:39-40*Hey you clowns and kids with Down's. Sorry I haven't updated this in a while, but I've been busy being out of town and whatnot.   Turkey Day was alright. I was the oldest kid there, so it wasn't exactly intellectually stimulating. One of my young cousins (before we arrived at their house) fell while carrying a glass bowl and cut a gash in his wrist and was taken to the emergency room. Fun stuff. He was ok, but he had a bandage on later, and the cranberry sauce that was served from that bowl was a little funny-tasting...  I didn't eat as much as I could have because i filled up on Marylin before the meal. Boy, I need some new material.  Oh, here's something that Sam brought up during our convo while I was at my cousin's house: how many of you think Austin really has a piercing "down there?" She says no, but I've heard things that point toward the contrary. ANYways...  We went to the Confederate War Museum here in New Orleans, or as my bro put it, the Confederate "Bore" Museum.  Ha ha ha... what a riot.  It actually wasn't that bad; there was a lot of interesting stuff to see about the War, and since I kinda enjoy histroy, it wasn't torture for me like is was for my bro and sis. We are having fried oysters tonight. Mmmmm... I love 'em.   Well, I have to cut this short for right now cuz my grandma is telling me to get offline. I'll do my best to update it later. Sorry for the delay!  God bless.Hey guys and girls and parsimonious squirrels. I'm back again today cuz i had nothing going on, and no one was online to talk to. My cousin was fun to play with today, and hit hit the ball really hard off of the tee. He's only like 3 years old, but he's a purdy good athlete if you ask me. He loves Pinocchio, though. That gets annoying after a while. He really likes the part with Monstro, the huge whale, and where Pinocchio and Ghetto Geppetto have to try and escape him. Maybe he's just sadistic in the sense that every time he watches it he hopes the heroes of the story will die. I dunno.  I'm glad everything's pretty much patched up between Erin and I. She was ticked at me for spending all of theater class writing a note to a certain someone (you know who you are) and she got really mad for me not helping with a project, and there was some bad blood. But everything's ok now! yaayyy!     New Orleans is great, thanks for asking. I like boudin and crabs and fried seafood (but you all have heard this already). And NOLA is full of that. I think I'm gonna be sick all over Mrs. kelley from eating too much. Then I will no longer be full, and can gorge myself on some of Melissa and Julie's wonderful brownies...or Marylin, whichever's easier. Oh wait, that would be Marylin, because she is SO easy!  That would be great if Melissa and Julie could combine their brownies...then I'd really be in Heaven listening to "Margaritaville" all day....  Anwyays, I gotta roll out now. Have a great Thanksgiving, and I'll update this sucka tomorrow (hopefully) so I can regale you all with my Turkey Day adventures!  God bless.Hey guys and gals and animal pals. Well, Austin last weekend was pretty fun. Seeing my bud wasn't as great as I thought it would be, but it was still ok.  Now i'm in New Orleans for Thanksgiving break, and it's fun-dee-dum. My little crzy cousin is here, always yelling, "Baseball! baseball! Outside! Baseball!" Good stuff...  Oh my god, that essay in Mrs. kelley's class was the biggest load of bull crud ever. we had to explain the themes and values of Wang Lung's adventures in  The Good Earth . I actually wrote it fairly long (like myself  ;-) ) but it was still really stupid. Mrs. Kelley should not be allowed to teach. We oughta take her bedraggled ole body and throw it down the high-rise stairs. She'd survive, of course, but she'd be like, "What the-?" and then we'd take her glasses, step on them, and blow the crystalline powder out of the window. Then she'd be groping around half-blinded, and stinking like yesterday's dirty diapers, and then we'd tell Mr. Huff that she was trying to grope us in a manner not befitting to a teacher of her stature, and she'd FINALLY be fired!  Boy howdy, that was stupid. I don't know where I come up with these stupid ideas, but I do. I'm sorry this hasn't been a very good blog. I'll try and make it better.   Well, Kelly Adams has never had Popeyes fried chicken! How crazy is that? I mean, only the most fattening, crunchy, greasy, heart-clogging food known to man and she's never tried it! Boy, she's missing out. I've decided that everyone who reads this should all get together and we'd have a big party at Cypresswood (Collins) Park, and a barbecue, and we could have streamers and noisemakers and strippers and POPEYES FRIED CHICKEN and presents for everyone and it will be ever so much fun! Or not. You guys give me a call sometime, and it could happen. Weather and strippers permitting of course.  Why do i write stupid stuff like that? I dunno. I'm just whacked out. Oh, on the drive over here, I had a feeling of impending doom, like I was going to die soon. If i do die on this trip, and I never see you guys again, just want you to know that I love you all, and I am thankful for each and every one of you. I just hope my demise will be particularly short and painless, and that I could make it into Heaven. Boy, that would be great...  Everyone has their own vision of Heaven, and mine is kinda puffy, and white (a little bit) and then once I really get into it, it's a beautiful tropical beach and clear water with no sharks or jellyfish and nice waves and Jimmy Buffet or a steel-drum band playing softly in the background. Ah, bliss....  Well, boudin and boiled crabs aside, chinese food is great. Where else can you buy spicy cat and/or dog disguised as beef or pork and totally enjoy it? Crab puffs are great too. Mmmm...Oriental garden....      Ok, I think that's enough for right now. Sorry that this blog has only been slightly satisfactory. I'l try ever so much harder next time.  Allrighty then, peace out. God bless.Hey guys.  Cross-country banquet was really fun. Andrew is darn glad he decided to get a ticket and go. When they showed the slideshow of all the outgoing seniors, it was really, um, emotional for some, because it's not like they were guys we only knew for one year, but these dudes had been with us throughout our whole CC career. But it was still cool, and we had pretty good Senior Gifts. It was all my idea of course, becuase all of the other slacker juniors were like, "Duuhhhh....we'll see if we can think of something before WE graduate..."  But anyway, We got the guys boxes of Wheaties with their pictures on it and a thank-you note thingy on the back thanking them for their dedication, help, inspiration, etc.  They really liked it, especially the two guys who have semi- 'fros that we found pics of cool runners with 'fros to transpose their heads onto.  Yeah.  Everyone went to Heather Hartzog's house afterward. Daaannnggg, that girl is rich! Her house was humong-diddley-mongous, and it had a cool secret room that had a stereo and foosball table....Oh, it was awesome. And Julie got to go the the banquet and Heather's and she really enjoyed herself. She makes good chocolate chip brownies...  But while we're on the topic; Julie, I'm so sorry, but Melissa's brownies are better. I know she whipped them up a la Betty Crocker, but I just like chocolate more than choc. chip. Marylin, however, still makes the best pie.... you guys know what I'm talking about.     Mrs. Kelley is smelly. I've heard this from those who have to sit in front of her when she's at her "second desk" and she breathes nasty hot air down the back of their necks. Just imagine the sound of a squirrel suffocating in a plastic bag, and that's what it sounds like when Mrs. Kelley breathes. And her breath reeks like yesterday's gym socks.   Wait a minute- nobody goes to "gym" anymore. It's all a bunch of namby-pamby athletic things like football, or dance, or that joke of jokes that counts as an athletic credit, Bearkadettes. You haven't tried something easy till you've tried Bearkadettes. All they have to do is get out there after hours and hours and hours of practice and perform in front of people who expect the very best all the time and once they dance and kick and ssttttrreeetttccchhh  their lil hearts out, return to a moronic instructor who tells them, "Smith! Mcellin! Markowski!  Your chins were not high enough, and I did NOT see enough smile from you. Morgan! I don't know what you're laughing about, but your jazz fingers were excessively annoying! I never want to be associated with any of you again!" IN case any of oyu couldn't tell so, (Melissa) I was joking about Bearkadettes being easy. From what I've heard, it's really hard. But not as hard as cross-country. Thats is a real man's sport. As we say, "Our sport is your sport's punishment."   But anyway....  I'm going to Austin for the weekend in about 10-20 minutes, so I will have to go get ready. I'm going to visit my friend Bert, who was my best friend from elementary school. Some of you may remember him; most never knew him. He's a cool guy, believe me. Oh, but he is nothing compared to Bobby Creighton. That guy is the King of Cool, lemme tell ya.     NOT. I have never met a more gay, stupid, idiotic, gay, wants-to-be-Negro, moronic, gay "dude" in all my life!  Those of you that know him, holla back. You know exactly what I'm talking about.  Sorry this hasn't been a great blog, but I've been rushed. I hoped you enjoyed it anyway, and I will try and update it as soon as I get back from my trip. Have a good weekend, chickee babies!    (What was I thinking when I wrote that last statement? Chickee babies? I mean, really....I'm not high or anything, so I don't know what came over me...)   Anyway, party on.  God bless.Hey guys.  Well, fasting was an interesting experience. I was like Wang Lung in the sense that after a while, I didn't feel the hunger anymore, so I guess I'm not really clean of sin if it wasn't a hard task. But I won't be doing it anytime soon, I can tell you that much. I know someone who had once gone a whole week without eating! Yeah, I know it's crazy! Like Marylin... the things that woman can make herself do... Oh, I'm about to faint just thinking about it. She makes the Kama Sutra look like "The Cat in the Hat," she's so dirty. Whoo, boy. Look out for her after a few glasses of Dom Perignon. ;-)  Yes, I know I've said this, but girls are messed up. They don't even know who they like, so I'm not sure if I should be mad at them or not. I mean, if I wanted to spray someone with Cheez Wiz, and couldn't decide, eventually that person would punch me in the face for even thinking about getting them messy. Like Mrs. Kelley, for instance. She give us 51 quotes to know for our test, and albeit they aren't that hard, we will probably have to write a huge paragraph for each one that she wants us to identify. She so sadistic like that. Grrr. >:-(     I oughta spray her wiht Cheez Wiz, and as she takes her glasses of to clean them, I'll spray it in her eyes. Oh, that would be sweet.....  Well, Melissa makes good brownies, and I thank her for them. Boy, did they kick some serious A. But Julie says hers are better, so I think we'll need a contest to figure out the best, and I will judge and get so sick from eating so many brownies, I would die. But it's not like anyone would care, eh? I would be happy to have passed on full of the gooey goodness of Marylin.. i mean, brownies. Right. And Kyle is a pig-tailed country lout. Tee hee. Come on, guys, giggle like schoolgirls....  Other than this stuff, not too much interesting has happened since yesterday. Oh, and everyone who reads this, bring a rubber band to school tomorrow, so we can start a new trend. It may be kinda stupid at first, but it'll catch on. Mybe.   I'll give you folks an update either tomorrow night, or Saturday after the Cross-Country banuet. Party on! God bless.Hey guys. Well, yesterday's blog kinda sucked, except Melissa seemed to worship me for it. If only I could get her to- oh, wait, nevermind. That's for my own personal diary. Not that I have one or anything....   Besides Melissa and Erin, girls suck. They never like who you want them to like, and if your best friend likes the same darn one you do, it really gets whacked out. Take heed, young' uns! Stay away from women. They're only bad news. Like Marylin, for instance. I got seven different venereal diseases from her! I mean, gosh: how many guys has that woman been with?! I knew it was quite a few, but dang, she's one promiscuous mother. Casey's mother that is.    But i know no one reading this cares about me or my problems (which is SO true), so let's move on. Today's english discussion was much better than last time. It was interactive with the host; like virtual reality or something. Except Craig is gay, and has crazybuttsex with guys. Oh those of ye that be faint of heart: beware calculus. If you be not willing to devote thy time and thy brain whole-heartedly to the math task, do not enter the horrifying realm of the feared Mallery.   Just joshing. It's actually not that bad, and i urge you to take it while you're still in high school. It's not as hard as you might think. Just tell her you're from Louisiana, and you're on her good side. And wear pink. A lot.   I'm going on a fast today as penance for my sins. I'm actually a bad person, and I'm going to hell. I haven't eaten anything since lunch (11:30 a.m.), and won't until tomorrow at lunch. At least I'll try. I don't know how strong my will is, but if I can do this, I can do anything. Except get a gf. That's a LONG time coming.  Anyway, I'd better get started on big ole history hw.  Catch you guys later.    God bless.Hey guys. Welcome to my underground lair...I mean blog. Right. So, school sucks. Mrs. Kelley needs to get outta here before i stab her in the face with the eraser end of my pencil. You could imagine what it'd be like...       Girls are so confusing, I think I'm gonna go crazy. Certain ones just preoccupy my mind, and it's like, "Go away! I can't think about you right now, you dirty slut!" Not really. They're not really dirty, I jst say that to ease the pain i get thinking about how i am such a loser. A personal bit of info about me that few know: I have never kissed a girl. Yup, Maja Playa Sean has never locked lips with a female. Or a male for that matter. ;-)  Relationships are so complicated. But hey, not like i would know, right?     Fajitas are pretty good. We had 'em for dinner. And fried chicken, and fried shrimp, and fried fish, and almost anything fried,and boiled crabs (ooohhh yeaahhh...), and just about all seafood. Oh, and Casey's mom is the best dessert; she's such a "treat."    Yeah, i have to go now. I would say this has been an ok blog. Gimme a holla and tell me whatcha think.  Peace out.  God bless.Holy snap, today has been boring. I read all of my blogs that I've ever written, and worked on a hemp neckalce for like 30 minutes; still not done. I also brought film to the store to be developed. Fun stuff. Kelly, you said you wanted to see pics of our ski trip; I'll show you sometime. I gotta jet. I'm gonna finish that necklace.   God bless.Hey-o. Well, I am a little peeved, cuz I am going out of town again tomorrow, and won't be coming back until the 4th. My whole freaking break has been wasted. Don't get me wrong, the ski trip was fun, but I want to see my friends, and I can't. The only time I will have to see anyone is today and then Sunday the 5th, and maybe Sat. night. It pisses me off to no end. Out of like 17 days off of school I can only hang with you guys 3 days. Whoop-de-doo. And it's already 2:00 and no one is really available to do anything today, so that sucks too. A whole day out of my three wasted, down the drain. The only good thing I got from it was that I went running today for like the first time in like 2 and 1/2 weeks. Felt good, it did. Andrew offered to let me spend the time that we would be out of town (in West Texas) at his house. I gladly would have taken him up on the offer, but my dad says no. Dammit. This is like the worst Xmas break ever. And it's stupid because when I was younger and we  did  stay in town, I wanted to go places, and now that I want to stay, we are going places. How ironic.   On a lighter note, I think some "I have never's" are in order. They have been absent from my blogs for a while now. Gotta bring 'em back in. And please, I wanna hear yours! Just make anything up! Come on, guys. Ok. I have never taken a bath with more than four rabid squirrels at once. I have never started the car I drive with a Dorito. I have never put snow in my pants to "cool the fire of my desire." I have never thrown a flower into the Grand Canyon and mourned for it. I have never derived pleasure from falling out of a tree. I have never electrocuted a mouse to see if he would get superpowers. I have never corrected a professor who said "sack" instead of "sac" when referring to the bulbous protrusions of pus on the Gremlins' backs. If you've seen the movies ,you knowwhat I'm referring to. I have never scarfed down an entire steak-and-cheese pizza by myself on three consecutive Saturdays. I have never played Lincoln Logs with a hairy elf. I have never built a weasel out of Vaseline and slid him down Lombard Street in San Fransisco. For some useless trivia info, Lombard St. is the crookedest street in the world. Yup. And I've been there. And finally, I have never received less than 17 venereal diseases from Marylin on any given night.   I am sooo bored! Someone please call me! 281-370-5298.   Anyone!......"Is anyone alive out there? Can anyone hear me?" Titanic, you know... ah, nevermind. Peace out, suckas. It's breakfast time.   God bless.Yo bros and hos! I am finally back, and am SO glad to be home. Not that my trip wasn't fun, just that I missed everyone badly, and...yeah. You wouldn't believe how much I yearned for a friend in Canadia. My bro and sis weren't bad, but I  needed some intellectual stimulation from one of you treasured readers. Not to get emotional here. (Keep it together Keep it together) For those of you who have seen Bowfinger, that's "borrowed" from it.   Well, I skiied a lot; fell down only a few times; went on green, blue, and black slopes; drank  chocolat chaud ; met only one girl- who was a senior in college- and we just skiied together for an afternoon, then we took her to her condo, and never saw her again; ate a heckuva lot of food; didn't run at all, worked out once, hot-tubbed three times; had a snowball fight with bro and sis; got bonding time with my dad; saw LOTR (it was cool); built up some forearm muscle by gripping the ski poles for hours at a time; broke my streak-NOOOOO!!! but hey, three weeks is a LONG time; found another song that reminded me of Sam- this time it makes more sense than the other one did- it's "Forget Everything." Again, it's by New Found Glory. This was like exactly how I felt during my "down" time a few weeks ago. They are a great band; at least I think so right now. Their songs just have emotion and truth in them. I dunno.Ha ha, Erin thinks bald guys are hot. I should shave my head...   Man, tonight was a blast. I got home, cleaned the pool, went to see The Ring with Andrew, Chris Kuna, Kyle, and others-it wasn't that scary- then came home and unwrapped Christmas presents. After that, I went to Starbuck's with Andrew, Chris, Melissa and Crystal, and who should we see there but Kelly Adams! Well, after i imprinted my face upon the window, and the Starbuck's employees shut out the lights on us, Kelly and I hung out at Kroger, where she had only recently got off working. Dude, she said my hair- and I quote- "looked cool." Wow. No girl has ever said that to me before. Amazing. Ha ha, but anyways, we ate like, 10 Reese's, and rode the 50-cent car thingy that rocks and beeps and stuff. I drove kelly to Africa, but then she had to depart to help her friend, so I didn't get a tip. Dang!    Well, to rid myself of grief, I will keep writing songs, and try and forget about you-know-who, cuz whenever I think about that person, I get all messed up, and I think my life will go better if they are not included right now. I will "erase them from my memory" as part of the NFG song goes. But we'll see.   Man, I'm tired right now, and I'm going running (finally!) tomorrow with Andew at 9, so I gotta jet. Peace out, suckas.   God bless.Hey blokes and folks. Still in Canada..oy vey. Don't worry though, I'm a-comin' home on Sunday the 29th. 2 days! Yeah.    Going to see Lord of the Rings tonight. The theater only had three tickets left, and we got 2 of them, as my bro and I are gonna watch it. And this was only because right before my dear mommy got in line, someone exchanged those tix for a different showtime, and thus we had some available to us.   Boy, i am tired form skiing. Moguls are fun, once you get used to them. They're likie giant 5o-foot hills that loom in front of you like a dragon, waiting for brave knights such as myself to attempt to scale them before hurling us down in a crumpled pit of loser-ness. Oh, speaking of loser-ness, any of those who doubted my funk was real, (such as one whose mother is Beverly for instance. I'm not sayiong she doubted it, but she doubted the funk of one of my good friends...she knows what I'm talking about) it was. I really was down in the dumps, and had gfotten all religious all of a sudden and felt I was going to hell. It all started with a certain girl, and continued because of other girls, math trouble, and just a need to be loved that was not being fulfilled. But I got threough it thanks to help from my good friends, and am totally feeling better with myself. Anywho, I need to write a song about it. Oh, my net time is just about up, so i will catch you folks later.   God bless.Hey peoples! Well, I got a chance to get online, and of course this is the first thing I head to!  Merry Christmas to all.   I be in Canada right now. Man, it's awesome. The scenery is magnificent, and the skiing is great. Plus, I'm a good skier, so I am totally taking advantage of the situation.    I got the New Found Glory CD for Christmas, and it's spoken to me like nothing else has. I love it. "Sonny" for some strange reason reminds me of Sam...I don't know why. If you can, download it. Also, "Head-on Collision" -the acoustic version is better- is also totally great. NFG kicks A.   Yesterday was Xmas Eve, and after skiing we went and walked around in the little village place by where we are staying. Alll of the other kids were sledding down a hill on these toboggan things that we don't have. So, I improvised, and taking a garbage bag, stuck my feet through, and went in all the way above my waist. Worked like a charm. Sat down, and slid right down the hill. It was great. Oh, Kyle and Andrew and all else who knew about it, my streak is kinda over. I lasted two weeks and 4 days, but yesterday night (Christmas Eve) there was involuntary Dr. Pepper. So I guess technically my streak is till on, cuz I didn't cause it to happen; my subconscious is at fault. So, it lives on. Wahoo...   I miss you guys terribly. Canada is great and all, but without my friends, it's kind of a drag. I have been eating well, though, and that's a plus. No love-making sessions with "Snow foxes" as Disco Stu might call them. That sucks. There was this one cute girl yesterday, but I never talked to her- though I should have- so nothing happened there. Also, on Monday, I saw some chick that looked like Casey, but she was foreign, and she skied (spelling?) away before I got a chance to say hey. More on these escapades as they develop.   Well, no time for "I have never's" becuase I have to budget my time on here, cuz it's five bucks per 45 minutes spent online. Canadian dollars, but still; it's outta my wallet. I will use my remaining time at later dates to talk to you guys on i.m. if possible.  Ok, I gotta jet. Party on!   God bless.Hey dudes and stuff and me in the buff.  Well, this will probably be my last update for a while as I am going to Canadia to skiand won't be back until the 29th. Som have a good holidays, everyone!   Kelly and I went for a walk today, FINALLY! We had been planning to do so for quite a while, but had never got the chance.It was rather fun, and her dog was a little hyper, but that's ok. Before that, I was almost naked at Andrew's house after soccer and Sonic for quite a while. I just hung around in my boxers as we all played cards. It was great. I know Melissa was SO not turned on, cuz I'm a skinny-ass m.f.-er. But anywho, soccer was fun, and Casey got her ears licked by Kyle, who thoroughly enjoyed it. Yesterday night, Melissa, Andrew, Casey and I tried to play Strip Mao (spelling, anyone?) but Andrew and I were the only ones who were willing to get naked. Of course we didn't, but would have if Melissa and/or Casey had. Whatever.   I'm gonna have to go in like 2 minutes, so no time for "I have never's." So sad...   Finals weren't too bad, but it's not like I wanna take them again. SCHOOOL"S OUT! YEEEAAAHHH!!!   I hope you all have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!     OK, I gotta jet- literally.  "Leavin,' on a jet plane... don't know when I'll be back again..."  Party on, people!   In the spirit of the season- God bless us, every one.Hey folks. I'm in calculus right now, workingon ThinkFive. Prepare to hate it when you get here. But hey, I'm online now, so how hard do you think calculus can be? Riggghht   ThinkFive sucks! I just got a 6/10 on my practice test. Not satifactory...  Today is our last class of Mrs. Kelley for the year!  YAY!  That freakish devil-woman is making us watch some stupid Scarlet Letter movie and the woman who plays Hester could have been Mrs. Kelley, because she's freaky-looking and has pale, pale, pale, blue eyes, like some demon-person.  But the girl in the movie is kinda hto, so the'res no way it coulda been her.  Anywho, I gotta jet right now. Peace out.   God bless.Man, I hate being right. I predicted earlier this blog that Sam wasn't gonna be able to make it to our "rendezvous" tomorrow, and I was correct in assuming so! Boy howdy. I guess it's not her fault though. Oh wait, it is! She was being rambunctious, etc. But anywho....Kizzyle and I will have our own fun, thank you very much. Sorry if I'm sounding mean; I'm not trying to.  Just trying to fill y'all in on the details of my life...     OK, i Gott get to steppin' now. Adios, amigos.  God bless.Hey girls and guys and freaky fruit flies. Just got done (almost) with my physics lab, and Margaret Evans just left. She smelled like rockin' good times. Well, about coincidences again; there I was... laying (or is it lying?) i bed, thinking about yo-yos yesterday before I went to sleep. Then, today in the comics, in "9 Chickweed Lane," the subject was yo-yos. Crazy. There was also another coinkydink, but I can't remember what it was, so I can't regale you with that boring episode of my life.    Well, I basically have no more work until the end of the year, EXCEPT FOR ENGLISH! Why is Mrs. Kelley such a dum-dum? Assigning us idiotic quotes to do the day before our final. I guess it's good practice for when we take our final, but still... I dunno. Maybe since she's old, she knows what she's doing......Nah. That can't be it.   Kyle and Sam and I are supposed to hang out tomorrow, since none of us have a sixth period final (boo-ya to all you suckas who do!), but I dunno how that's gonna go. maybe in typical British Spy fashion, one of us will back out of it, but we'll see. I hope we all have lots and lots of fun and oh boy oh boy oh boy. *Ahem* I mean, we could have a good time, bowling (?) or eating Cheez Wiz straight from the spray container until we barf all over the inside of a red jeep Cherokee, or a turquoise Pontiac Grand Am or a white BMW 318i. Either way, it had better be a blast, or I'm taking out someone with my spitball gun....Fire in the hole!   " I'm Henry the Eigth, I am. Henry the Eigth I am, I am. I got married to the widow next door; she's been married seven times before. And every one was an Henry (Henry!), no she wouldn't have a Willy or a Sam (or a Sam!).   I'm her 8th ole man, I'm Henry... Henry the Eigth, I am..." Herman' Hermits, gotta love 'em.   "Slowly walkin' down the hall, faster than a cannonball..."   We didn't have to run today in track! Yay! So we played 5-hack whack! Hooray! For those of you that don't know, 5-hack whack is not a sexually perveted game, but is played with a bean-filled sack called a "hackey sack." The "hackey sack" is repeatedly kicked, kneed, headed, or jounced into the air -with no hand contact- until two people have touched it, and it has been "hacked" at least 5 times. Then, a player may catch the "hackey sack" and proceed to peg another player with it, thus rasing one heckuva welt. (That's a helluva hullabaloo, eh, Melissa?) Fun game; you should try it sometime. I'm getting a so-called "hackey sack" for Christmas. I'll practice with anyone who would like to, at any time. Bring it!   Well, dinner calls soon, so here are some "I have never's." I STILL haven't heard any form anyone else, except that one time like a month ago when Melissa put some, and I repaet, some, into her own blog. You dirty whores...  Ok.  I have never gyrated. Kyle, this one's a shout out to you. Holla back! I have never asked a gansta "How goes it, Homie?" I have never stored pornographic images in my own trash can. Cuz they'd get thrown away, that's why. Geez, some people...  I have never telephoned Guadalajara and told the cusoms official to let my friend Juan through into America. I have never floozied my chinka until it masticulated underneath my bed.   Sorry this is so short, I gotta go.  God bless.Hey peoples and incarnate steeples. I really should be doing my Women's Reader assignment for Mr. V's class, but I'm and idiot and I love to procrastinate.I just had 4 tacos from Jack-in-the-Box. Mmmm, they were good. They were horrible for my body nontheless. I am not really scared about finals this year (except for math, of course)  even though I should be. I haven't even started physics review yet, and I  really  need to get to work on that. So it goes...   My life is full of weird coincidences. The last two years in English we read "Great Expectations" and "A Tale of Two Cities." Well, a comic in the paper printed a strip regarding each one, and at the time I was reading them. Now, I have declared myself Fuhrer of the Spherical Projectiles Club, and in Parade Magazine in the Sunday paper, there is a quip about Hitler and him being the "fuhrer" of Germany. Whack. And JUST NOW, I was thining if I would ever see Andrew Ebers online, and then all of a sudden, an i.m. from him pops up saying "Hey Sean." Wow.   Chickety-China, the Chinese chicken. Have a drumstick and your brain stops ticking.    "Wonderwall." I have been obsessed with that song for the past few days. I have no idea why, either. It just sounds really cool. It's also about birth control (according to Julie), so maybe I'm just interested cuz it deals with sex. Hormones, these days. Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em.   Well, Kyle and I hung out yesterday, and it was fun. He bought some Garfield slippers that were too small for him, but he loves them like a brother. We went to Wendy's, and they took like 20 minutes to make my Chicken Bacon Swiss sandwich, so I ended up getting free fries. It was wonderful....like Marylin. Friday was her 50th birthday! Oh, I gave her a present she'll never forget. She unwrapped my "package," and then....well, you can read about it in my letter to Penthouse. NOT REALLY, PEOPLE! well, also on Friday night (before my "party" with Marylin) I chilled, as the saying goes, with my homies, Melissa, Andrew, Casey, Crystal, and Meagan. We "chilled"    OK, some "I have never's" because I really need to do Women's Reader before I go over to Erin's house to work on a theater project. Here goes: I have never screamed "Silent Night" to my deaf neighbors so they could truly experience the Christmas Season. I have never slid down the stairs on a decapitated Eskimo. I have never put mushy bananas (or anything, for this matter) up my butt. You all can thank Kyle for this last sentence, because, well...I don't think you really wanna know. But you could ask him... I have never spleemed my flim-flam by the hoober-doober next to my gon-diddley badunka dunk. I have never wiped out while dancing ballet in my History class. I have never touched an orangutan's nipples in frosty weather. I have never seen a fat lady amke out with a foot-tall chihuahua. I have never been to Timbuktu becuase my shipment of irate Iranians was delayed. I have never thrown a frozen dinner into a volcano so it could "heat up really fast." I have never surfed down Beverly's Hills. ha ha, Melissa. I have never taken my pinky finger for granted. I have never twiddled my thmbs in time to "Dueling Banjos." I have never been to a Bob Seger/Phil Collins concert and not enjoyed it. I have never stuck a key into an electrical socket so I could try and get an Afro. I have never killed a three-toed possum and fed it to my brother. I have never swam into a house in under seven minutes.   OK, that's enough for today. I gotta jet so I can finish this project. Why must history repeat itself?  On my computer that is. it seems to be the only thing I ever do on this baby. Anywho, peace out.   God bless.Hey fruits and fags and dudes in drag. Boy howdy, I'm weird. Honestly, why would I write a sentence like that? I mean really...   Well, I'm in Physics class right now with that hot sucka, Margaret Evans, when we're supposed to be working on a major lab. Well, we just got done smoking a jay and having casual sex under the lab table, so I guess it's been an ok day. NOt really. I'm sorry this blog has been so corrupt today. I'm just buzzed on Dandelion Wine. Mrs Kelley is one whacked out mother. She smells funny, and I would know becuase I sit right in front of her. She breathes loudly, and the other day she went on a tirade on how she once sprayed Lysol in her room and couldn't stand the smell after a while.    I am the Official Fuhrer of the Spherical Projectiles Club. Boo ya! I know you're all thinking Hitler, but it's just the German word for "leader." Yeah. But, I will be in supreme command of the club, and soon we will expand to take over the world at your expense! Suckas. Actually I will have no responsibility; I'm just Fuhrer in title only.    I forgot to mention earlier in the week that my team are the CONEBALL CHAMPIONS OF THE WORLD! Yeah, that's right. Our Cross-country team beat out the Brotherhood for the title. It is a really fun game, and I urge all who can to play. And by "all who can," I mean boys. Cuz, rules say, the girls can't play. So sorry. Oh, I also had to revert back to my old backpack becuase guys with "messenger bags" as they are so called cannot play either. I had one of those one-strap things, but not anymore.   I shall only post a few "I have never's" because I really need to get to work on Physics. I have never sneezed in an elevator onto a corporate bigwig. I have never thrown a sow 40 yards within the space of 5 minutes. I have never worn only underwear to a "Dress: formal" convention. I have nevertaken a crawfish to church. I have never seen aliens more than seven times. I have never recovered buried treasure and given it to the poor. I kept it all for myself. I have never had a nose job to hide the fact that I don't have a deviated septum. I have never eaten octopus brains and not thrown up. I have never stopped being a weirdo who writes these bizarre things on his blog. "How bizarre, how bizzare...doo doo do, doo doo do, doo doo do..." You guys remember that song? Whatever. I gotta jet   God bless.Hey dudes and fools and chicks with tools.  Um, about that last sentence, I meant like drills and screwdrivers and stuff. Nothing, how do you say? unnatural.Well, I am sorry I couldn't update my blog yesterday after I said I would, but my history took longer than expected. But I finally finished my history, and turned it in early for xtra points. Oh, speaking of history, my group got the highest score out of all Mr. V's classes! We rule, and that's all there is to say.    I like travel ping pong. I hope George likes it too.   Well, I am going to be wearing a Junior Women T-shirt tomorrow for Calculus, not for any "other" reasons. Craig Davis, I'm looking at you. I'm hoping it will boost my grade on an otherwise abhorrent test. That final is 6 days long! My God, doesn't the woman have anything better to do than torture us?! Speaking of which, it's 10:45, and I still need to study for tomorrow. That means I shall have to skip ahead to everyon'es favorite part of the show, "I have never's!" Yay!   Ahem... I have never shot a duck with a potato cannon in order to fry it in Crisco. I have never slept in Physics class, only to wake up having someone yelling at me, "Sean you crapped your pants!" I have never whizzed off the Eiffel Tower onto a mime's head. I have never seen a two-headed cow that can do algebra. I have never done a pirouette so I could gain the favor of a paraplegic dancer. I have never caught a touchdown pass thrown by Steven Hawking. He is the greatest athlete of all time! I have never screamed at a hibiscus to make it excrete goat's milk to make cheese with. I have never been fingernail-clippered to death. I have never played dominoes with a Domino's Pizza delivery boy. I have never played guitar in front of millions of screaming girls, only to have my suspenders break at the furious solo that I perform. I have never taken a bath under a desk. I have never seen a parsimonious squirrel through puberty. I have never bought a fake tattoo that reads, "I like to fly 4 kites" to be emblazoned on my forehead. I have never eaten a live mongoose. I have never gotten over the fact that I am obsessed with girls. Whatever. I'm tired and math calls. I will chill with you homies tomorrow.   God bless.Hey homies and crips, and girls that do flips.   I have realized that music is such a big part of my life, I had no idea before. I mean, who knew that the Hanukkah Song describes exactly what I'm going through in life? I am so Jewish...   But no, really, there are a lot of songs that I like, that affect me whenever I hear them, and there are many that describe a lot of what happens to me. Especially blink 182; I don't know how they know what's going down with me, but they do somehow. I dunno. I've also been raised a lot around music (don't worry, this isn't one of those VH1 Behind the Music things) and I really like it. I know almost every song on Oldies 107.5,  so I can now officially consider myself a true balla. "If you wanna know, if he loves you so, it's in his kiisss... (That's where it is!)"    Oh my god! We changed seats in Mrs. Kelley's class today, and not only am I far away from crazy/cool/contabulous Sam, but I am now in the desk right in front of where the Devil herself sits! Mrs. Kelley sits there breathing loudly down my neck (or those of you who read my blog awhile ago, saying that she breathes like a squirrel suffocating in a plastic bag is an undertstatement! And she talks when she breathes out! She breathes in, and then she's like, "Ugh-gotta-grade-those-stupid-quizzes-ooga-booga-I'm- going-to-kill-you-all  *exhale.*") and I'm afraid one day her jaw will just unhinge, and she will rear back, then lunge forward and eat my small and misshapen head!   But anyway, I gotta jet for now, Pir. Docs. call! (Ugh...I still have 2 more to do...)  but I will update more later, including some more fancy "I have never's."   God bless.One other thing; a great lyric from a song I heard today: "My grandfather would have been 80 today...but in '45, he fell down beside an American child..."  I just think that's emotionally stirring, considering how much the World War II generation sacrificed for us, all of the pain and suffering and needless death and destruction and heartbreaking demise, so that we could have our freedom from tyranny, oppression, and the evils of the world that surround us. I personally wish to thank them right now, even if no vet ever reads this. Go USA!!!!!Hey you crazy cats who walk on welcome mats. Well, having gone through a turbulent time in my life due to the excessive amounts of thinking about girls and how they mess with my mind, I've emerged, more confident in myself than ever before. I have been reassured of my existence and that I DO have some friends. Thanks, Kizz-yle and Sizz-am. You guys are true blue. Like Blue's Clues. "Here's the mail it never fails, it makes me wanna wag my tail, when it comes I wanna wail, 'Maaiiillll!' "   Ahem. Ok, question: That Steve guy who was on the show went off to college. How he accomplished that when he couldn't figure out that Blue wanted to make a sandwich after the first two clues (at the max) without the help of a buncha backstage pre-schoolers is beyond me. I mean, the guy must be half retarded! "I wanna play baseball! Yay! I hit a home run every time!..."  Ha ha, that's for you, Andrew and Kyle. Speaking of college, I have no idea where I wanna go. I'm thinking LSU (Geaux Tigers!) or Tulane, but my dad wants me to go the Naval Academy. Now THAT would be an adventure. Waking up at 4 a.m. every morning so they can run you ragged and pound it into your head that America kicks ass (which it does) and they train you to drown at sea...  Good stuff. I think I will go there. I checked out the campus and got a tour of it last summer, and it  was  pretty sweet. I mean, that would be a really memorable and beneficial experience for me.    Ohhh, I am a balla. I got a perfect score on today's English quiz, I just know it. Mrs Kelley can suck a lemon. Ha ha, which reminds me of the Simpsons. Everything in life can be traced to that show. Ok, here's a quip from when there was a mafia war:   Guy: "Johnny Tightlips [who can keep a secret really well] where'd they hit ya?"  Johnny: "I ain't sayin' nothin"  Guy: "Then what do I tell the doctor?"  Johnny: "Tell 'im to suck a lemon."     Oh, it was great. If you watch the show, you'd appreciate how ingenius it really is....   I wrote a song yesterday about a girl. Not a specific girl that goes to our school, really, just the song is about a guy who can't get this girl he likes. It needs some revision, but here's one of my favorite verses: "Later on that day I saw her walking in the hall....And secretly I was hoping she would stumble and she'd fall...Then maybe I would see that she is not the perfect girl...Who I had made to be everything in my sad and lonely world."   My other favorite part is the very beginning: " I went to school today to see that girl I wish was mine...I like her oh so much; she's so smart and she's so fine."   Yeah.  And the part about the "left-arm elbow joint"... Um, yeah. Well, I am a pitcher in baseball and I throw with my left arm. Last season my elbow started hurting for a few weeks after a game. So, it's like my left-arm elbow joint is something that causes me pain.  Plus, it had to rhyme with "point" for the song's sake, so, yeah.   I am sorry it has taken me so long to update this. I was just depressed and down about everything lately. I am so sorry I've been that way this year, guys. I love you all, and I would never want to push you away from me in any way. I had never been depressed like this before in my life, but hey, there's a first time for everything. But I'm through it all! YAYYY!!!     I hope. "I can see clearly now the rain has gone..."   I just wanna thank everyone who has been so supportive of me through all of this, especially Kyle and Julie. You guys were there from the start. I'd kiss you both, but I will just give Kyle a firm but gentle handshake. I think you all know why. (I'm not gay)  In case you couldn't figure it out for yourselves, without three clues from a dog who's smarter than you, and pre-schoolers' help.   Also, I'm sorry this one has't been very funny. I just had to get some stuff off my chest.  Ok, here's some more "I have never's"  I need other people to make a list of theirs! I wanna hear them! Ok, here goes:  I have never stuck a flaming hamster up my left nostril. Can't say the same for the right one, though.   I have never slid down a frozen modem. I have never eaten brunch with a furry Spanish rhododendron. I have never picked out a bouquet of computer mice from a "Where's Waldo?" book. I have never squeezed a heffalump or a southpaw woozle. I have never taken a girl and thrown her into a brick wall just to see if her butt was strong enough to break it. I have never played lacrosse with a team of half-monkey, half-hip-hop-anonymouses. For all you fans of "Big Daddy," that one was for you. I have never had zero-gravity sex. I bet that would be AWESOME, though. Once I'm married, of course...you rogues. Yaarggghh! I have never placed peanut butter or jam in my floppy disk drive, hoping it would play "Peanut Butter Jelly Time." I have never sewed an American flag out of cocktail napkins. I have never stitched a Union Jack into the backside of a platypus. And, last but not least, I have never drop-kicked a tiny dog, only to have it land on an angled trampoline so that it bounces right back at me, so I can do it all over again.    Anywho, I'm hoping you dudes and dudettes enjoyed this, as I think I'm back to my former self. Oh, I only have two cross-country pics left, for all you girls who want one. Well, yes Kyle, you can have one, too. Ha ha. But be quick, they go fast. Sandra thinks they're just awesome, but hey, who am I to say they're not?  Just keep them away from Yurianna. Never let her know you have one, please. There is a personal reason for that which I'd like to keep disclosed.   OK, that's enough for today. I have stupid Pri. Docs. to work on. Oh, Sam; I think we  should  have a Hug Sean Day. That was the best idea I've heard from a British person since the invention of the power loom. Just don't get  too  close to me, guys. I don't wanna start another lice epidemic like I did in third grade. Sorry about that, Mrs. C. Wall's class!   God bless.   Oh, I was kidding about the lice thing. Never had 'em before in my life.Just one question: How would you guys feel if I killed myself? Now, be honest with yourselves. Think about it....   God bless you all.Whoa. Sam got a blog of her own, and I am shocked. She wants a tattoo... I mean, I've always wanted one since I was little, but that's me. I'm weird and stupid. She is talking about getting one, in a very serious manner to boot, and it's just so shocking to me. I mean, I've always viewed her as a sweet, mostly innocent girl who would never do anything so...rebellious and/or....i dunnno what the word is.   It just blows my mind. Seriously.        I am blowing this way out of proportion. I mean, it's her life, let 'er do what she wants.        AAAAAAAAGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!  A tattoo.....   oy vey.....Hey, an album cover and therapist. If you watch SNL, you'll get that. Think Sean Connery....   Anywho, Erin and I saw the play yesterday. It was really funny. I urge all who can to go see it. Kamen Edwards does a really good job. "Sank you." "Sofa." "Remarkab-b-b-ble..." and, last but not least, "Sheet head." Ha ha ha.   Well, about "those two" people that were supposedly doing something wrong, forget about 'em. All conversation regarding that will stop. Now. This minute, I say. NOW!    Oh, I screwed up on our other half-major grade in English! It was an easy 100, all we had to do was memorize 20 literary terms, and I only got 19! Arrgh, I'm a failure.... as usual...    But I am having chinese for dinner tonight, so all is right with the world.  I hope everyone likes chinese. If not, you're really missing out. Beef with broccoli (spicy) kicks serious A, and Hunan beef is good too. And the crab puffs....oh, baby! Tammy Reese, when I was kinda going out with her, said she'd make me some crab puffs sometime, but she never did. That ho.  Actually she's nice, but she never made me crab puffs... I almost cried.    Ok, Melissa thinks listing "I have never's" is dumb, but I don't care. Her list was funny, and I think she should put up more. Here's some more of mine: I have never beaten myself in the face with a baseball bat. I have never surfed down an upside-down helicopter. I have never been to Timbuktu on a llama. I have never squeezed a snowman for pleasure. I have never walked in on your parents. I have never eaten a chicken testicle in wine sauce. I have never stopped being the stupid idiot that I am who comes up with these weird things he's never done.  I have never made out with an armchair on a Thursday. I have never watched a strip show involving disgruntled porcupines. I have never captured an elf in a cranberry sauce jar. I have never shot a midget out of a cannon (although I'd like to). I have never married an undersea fish-girl. I have never spread mustard on three yaks at once.  "Yakkity yak! (Don't talk back.)"  Who remembers that song?  I do; it was great! Ha ha ha...   Ok, I have to get started on math hw, so I will catch you folks later. Party on in the hizzouse!  God bless.Hey G's and thugs and hairy dead bugs.   "Got some words I don't know; gonna sing 'em, here I go."   Two friends of mine, one of which is my best friend, are doing something RIGHT NOW that I'm not sure should be going on. Those of you who know who and what I'm talking about, well, I bet you agree.    Sorry about my crazy paragraph about the Dandelion Wine yesterday. I was tripping out on something, although I'm not sure what. I think I totally screwed up my history paper yesterday. Oh, well. At least I still have a 96 IN MRS. KELLEY'S CLASS!!!! Take that, you -know-who you are! I got a blinking 101 on a half-major grade AP practice test, and whooped up on everyone. So sorry!      Ha ha ha ha....   Kyle is quitting track.. so sad...  I will miss him, and Andrew too. Those fools. Don't they know that running lengthens your life? That is, unless you die doing it, which is what could happen with the sadistic workouts Coach Yates gives us. But oh well, I will just be by myself like the lonely guy I am and have to run by myself and I will cry myself to sleep.  "I've seen fire and I've seen rain...I've seen sunny days I thought would never end...I've seen lonely times where I could not find a friend...But I always thought that I'd see you again....."   English class was fun today, cuz I got to rub it in She-knows-who-she-is-and-is-smarter-than-me's face the fact that I got a better grade. Well, that part was just ok. I don't mean to be mean. I'm sorry, British Spy......And we (as in everyone in the class) got to talk today, which was unusual for Mrs. Kelley's class. She is usually like, "Shuttup before I eat you all!!!"  But not today. It was fun.     Sorry I'm not writing very long things today. I just can't think of anything to elaborate on....   Erin and I are going to see the play tomorrow!  Our thater teacher directed it, and we have to write a reviw about it. We will tell her that we thought it sucked and she should give up theater forever! Bwahahaha      But that would be mean. So, I guess we'll just see it, and maybe sit by Kyle and Sandra and others who are also seeing it at the same time.    Ok, here's some more "I have never's." I have never gotten a response from anyone who read this and told me any of their "I have never's." Losers.   That's it.   "No trophy, no flowers, no flash bulbs, no line. He is haunted by something he cannot define.  Bowel-shaking earthquakes of doubt and remorse; assail him, impale him with monster truck force."   My pool is filled with leaves and needs to be cleaned. I am too lazy to do it, and thus will wait until my dad gets home from out of town and yells at me to do it. Oh well. Dead bug.    Allright, I know you want some more, so here they are: I have never taken the "Polar Bear Plunge." I have never run a marathon. I have never "Dr. Peppered" in public. Casey, that 'un's for you. I have never turned my eyeballs inside out. I have never stopped thinking of some girl or another.I have never eaten a moldy taco and lived to tell about it. I have never been captured by pirates. I have never engaged in homosexual activity. I have never rolled a cheese wheel down a large hill. I have never been shot. I have never bitten the doctor while he tried to administer a shot to me. I have never cleaned my ears and put earwax on a sandwich. I have never stopped being weird. I have never ridden a peccary. I have never sucked plywood through a straw.        Anyway, thats enough for today. I am going to try and update this again tomorrow, maybe after the play so I can tell y'all how horrible it was.  OK, gotta jet.  God bless.Hey cats and dogs and readers of blogs. I had most of this typed, then accidentally hit the "back" button and I had to start all over, so it's not as good as it originally was.  I got an awesome calculus progress report. A whopping 62.6, thank you very much. My dad was a little ticked, saying things like, "You didn't do the work" and "You blew your chance at an A," etc. So now I am grounded from instant messenger, phone (unless someone calls ME. Hint hint, people) and possibly TV. So, I guess you guys are getting a slight break from me. A little down time without the Sean. I'm sure it will be much appreciated. Don't let my grade scare you, though. I didn't do the work (not putting in time for hw) and am getting the grade I earned. I guess I just got lazy after getting a TREMENDOUS 92 last 6 weeks. You guys should all take calculus. Just do the hw, and you'll understand it. Hopefully. I'm sure all who do take it will do well, especially that British spy that beat me out in English with a 96 *grumble grumble*  She's a smart one, allright but I still own Physics, ha ha!   Dandelion Wine is a whacked out book. The kid Douglas goes through the summer of 1928 making a list of traditional and new things he experiences. I'm sure coming soon he will write, "Got drunk on dandelion wine yesterday. Grandpa and I had a sexual liaison while I was still inebriated. That was a hoot. Oh, me and younger brother Tom smoked a jay behind the barn. He was sooo high.... we gazed at the clouds, wondering how they looked remarkably like Marylin ready and waiting for us...ooh, yeah." Ha ha ha. I'm sorry if I offended anyone with this last paragraph. I never write about stuff like this. I have never been drunk or high ever. I was once at a place where there was drinking, and a friend of mine offered me a glass with some stuff in it, actually saying, and I quote: "Peer pressure, Sean, peer pressure." It was funny...kinda.   Red beans and rice tonight. One of my Cajun favorites. For those of you who didn't know, I was born in Louisiana. August 26, 1986 at 6:56 a.m. at Lakeside Hospital in Metairie (right outside of New Orleans), Louisiana. I lived there a while, moved to Katy, TX, then to Long Island, then to Stamford, Connecticut, then here to good ole Houston. And all this before I was 5.  I built a fence this summer. It took 6 days, at about 4-6 hours a day, including dismantling. Andrew hepled one day for about 5 minutes after he had spent the night. He sucked at it. Ha ha.    I have never made out with a girl in a wheelchair. I have never bungee jumped into a vat of Jell-O. I have never killed a squirrel and lied about it, then hiding the squirrel in my sister's bedsheets, thus blaming her for it. I have never eating a frog's gall bladder. I have never heard a person say, "That's a helluva hullabaloo." (Someone please say this to me tomorrow.)  I have never sang karaoke in front of Japanese businessmen. I have never thrown up in a swimming pool. I have never walked on the roof of an upside- down house. I have never stood naked on the Moon. There are a lot of things I haven't done. Please share some of your "never" experiences with me. I'd be glad to hear them, and maybe even post them on here! Then you'd be world-famous. Yay!   Ok, I have a big dumb history paper to write. It's about the Civil War and how it could have been prevented. I think I will list the factors that led to it, then make up some names of guys who invented machines that got rid of the need for slavery, thus erasing that question from politics, and so the War would never have taken place. Or not.  Anyway, I will try to update this a lot (cuz I can't im, so this will be my only contact with you guys unless you CALL ME   wink wink) and try to "keep it real" as the saying goes.  OK, g'bye for now. God bless.Hey dudes, dudettes, and lunch ladies with hair nets (such as Siggley and Marisol Martinez, eh, Casey?).   Well, I already told some of what happened over the break, here's some money for any and all who are interested.  Ah, gotcha. I said money, but I meant "more"...  Boy, am I dumb... You guys can agree, it won't offend me. I know it's true. :-)  Well, Thanksgiving morning, I met these two chicks from Texas while I was running in the park. Good stuff. One goes to U of H, and the other in Dallas or something. They weren't that hot, but they kept a pretty good pace, so I was happy. Like Marylin; she goes FAST. Believe me, kids, it takes two to tango, and boy does she tango!  Anywho, I got a 92 on my physics test! In your face Sam!  *Ahem* Sorry bout that.... Also, I got sick Thurs. night and barfed not one, not two, but FOUR times within the space of a few hours. Mm-mmm, good. Like Campbell's, you know... Ah, nevermind. This is over everyone's head. I don't know why I bother....Just joshing. You guys are all smart (to my knowledge) especially Sam, no matter what grades she gets on her physics tests and English papers.  ;-)  ..... *giggle*   *snort*   *chuckle*  ......  Well, Friday wasn't that great, owing to my being incapacitated, but it wasn't horrible either. The drive home was a bust (7.5 hours) cuz we got stuck in traffic cuz of a football crowd that left on the same day we id.   >:-(   Oh, the Saints beat Tampa! WooHooo!  Who dat?! Who dat?!  If you're not from New Orleans, you wouldn't understand. So sorry.    After Kelly's constantly berating me to watch "The Christmas Shoes," yesterday, I did. Just joshing; she didn't badger me to, she just said "You should watch it," so I did, seeing as I had nothing else going on other than the Saints game.  Well, it's a somewhat smarmy movie about a boy whose mommy has a heart problem and she's gonna die and he wants to give her special red dancing shoes for her last Xmas. Very sentimental, heart-tugging, etc. The boy finally gets the shoes on Xmas Eve, like the day before his mom dies, and she is laying in bed telling him to put them on her feet. I thought it woulda been funny if he put them on the wrong feet, and in her weakened and destitute state was like, "Ouch! Honey, that hurts. You're putting them on the wrong feet."  Ha ha ha.   Sorry. I'm so dumb. I just thought that woulda been a little humorous, tee hee.   Well, this 'un wasn't too long cuz I didn't wanna bore anybody, so I'll try and post more tomorry. Yes, I spelled tomorrow "tomorry." Kinda like old geezers sying "tobaccy" instead of tobacco. I dunno. I like it.     I love Erin! She is the best ever!  Allright! Woo hoo! Party time!  Hokey Pokey! Bonus round! This Bud's for you! No soup for you!  OK, that's enough for today. God bless.Hey there all of you red-faced baboons. Or, if that seems too offensive, consider yourselves golden lion tamarins. They're like the smallest monkeys in the world. Cool, huh?    Well, as I've said before, calculus sucks. OK, I know I'm contradicting what I've said before, but don't take it next year. Really. It's hard, unless you're entirely willing to put work into it, which I'm not. So, it is hard sh*t. Yup yup.   I've had some comments to change my blog, but I ain't going to. Sucks for those people. I've had a buncha others say they enjoy this very much, so I'll stick with a good thing. Majority rules. Maybe you could fight it out in my forum. Yeah, do that. Post opposing opinions on my forum, and whoever gets the most support, we'll go that way. Oh yay, this'll be so much fun!   Christine Drew is awesome! She's a good friend who genuinely cares about people, and I'm very lucky to know her. She made my day a lot better today. Thanks, Christine. :-)   Sam got hugged quite a bit today- hope she enjoyed it! And I hoped it worked too.   Well, I'm going on a retreat this weekend, so I can't update until at least Sunday. Enjoy this while you got it, folks. Hey, an exciting adventure would be to go and read all of my blogs from the first to the last, and see how much they've evolved. I've already done that twice before. It was fun- it was like reliving the past. Almost like that loser Douglas Spaulding (who is pretty smart for a twelve-year old). It only took me like, 20-30 minutes. So if you've got that time, go ahead and do it. I hope I have fun on my retreat, get closer to God, and figure out my screwed-up life. And maybe make some new friends or even meet a new girl. Ha ha. Anyways, I'm gonna jet now. Peace out, suckas. Man, Greg Kelly rubs off on you...Right. Class dismissed.   God blessHello, all of you liederhosen-wearing gerbils. Well, it seems my forum is a rousing success so far. Continue to add to it, people! I don't have much time today, so this'll be quick.   Calculus sucks.   Track is...meh.   English- you know that one.   Cheese is good.   Calculus sucks.   Song of the day is "Sadie Hawkins Dance" by Relient K. It's a great song, and it is cool, cuz the dude gets asked by "a girl so stunning." It's a crazy coincidence too, cuz I got the CD it's on today, and it was the same day I found out I woulda been asked to Sadie by somone if not for a prior commitment. Grrr. And I KNOW I woulda had fun with them. But hey, it's all good. I'm not mad or anything. :-)  Here's the refrain to that song- the oh oh oh is in a high voice. "Sadie Hawkins dance, in my khaki pants; there's nothing better- oh oh oh...the girls ask the guys, it's always a surprise; there's nothing better- baby, do you like my sweater?" Ha ha ha ha...ah geez....it's great. Don't forget! Tomorrow's Hug Sam Day! Whenever you see her, hug her. You know she likes it.  ;-) Class dismissed.   God blessWell, I think I know who my REAL friends are! Seems Katie and Melissa are the only ones who writ (yes, that's right- I said "writ." As in past tense of "write," you know?) in my forum. I guess they're the only ones that truly care...*sniffle*...  Just kidding; I know (or hope?) I have more friends than that. Thanks to Mel and Little Red Riding Bike for responding, though, it was cool. Everyone, I want your comments! Feedback is always im-por-tan-te. Right. Well, math calls again- unlike girls. How come girls never call me? It must be becuase they're "old-fashioned." Sure, that's it... Well, class dismissed. Maybe I should stop saying that, cuz it might remind you of school, and I know that's the last thing anyone wants to think about. Whatever...why don't you let me know IN MY FORUM. Ha ha, peace out, guys.   God blessOK, the thing I tried to get on my blog worked. It's at the top, and it says, "Click here to enter forum." Well, you guys can write messages to me, or responses to my blogs in it for everyone to read. Fun, eh? Yes. Well, I encourage everyone to 'ave a go at least once. Who knows, you might like it....Class dismissed.   God blessHey there, all of you sexy one-eyed, one-horned, flying, purple people-eaters. I'm sure everyone knows how to be one of those. Well, your mom and I had a good time today. If she asks about me, tell her I said, "Calamity is the essence of our defense system."    Wow, it was great today that we didn't have 16 4's! Coach changed his mind at the last minute, and so we had a 30-minute run to Meyer, during which we played Speedball, and it was a lot of fun. Good times...   Kyle and I are bad people. We say things that should remain unsaid. I know I'm going to hell, but he says he's forgiven, so that's cool. At least we can be best buds in this life. My sister is a candy cane today. Her shirt is red-and-white striped. Like a candy cane. Red-and-white striped. Like a candy cane. Red-and-white striped.   I'm so sorry, you-know-who-you-are for me screwing you up on your pre-cal test. That cross I lent you only had Catholic power. I'm so sorry; I didn't realize it until it was too late! I'm so sorry.... pre-cal is hard enough without someone lending you an unlucky talisman. Just do well on the next tests in the 6 weeks, and you'll be ok. Good luck to everyone else too.   C lunch is ok, and cheese is good. Sam needs to cheer up; love is harsh, but it happens. It can also be really great if you let it. Just go with the flow! Yahooo. I'm sorry if you don't want me mentioning your llife like this; just lemme know, and *zap* (that's an onomatopoeia, by the way) it's gone. We should have an official Hug Sam Day. I had one, and it's only the least we can do to have one for her in return. Friday it will be! This Friday, everyone hug Sam. She'll love it. I hope. UNless she gets pissed and says, "Stop hugging me, all of you!" But that probably won't happen. I think polar bears should be defined as bears that hang out by the poles on street corners. What are your views on the matter? Lemme know tomorrow.   I gotta study for horrible calculus now. Have a good night everyone; I'll try and get online later. Class dismissed.   God blessHello, tapeworms and spirokeets. Sorry I haven't updated for a while- I'm a loser, I know. School sucks, as usual, except fot the fact that I see my friends occaisionally. Yay. Calculus grade is suffering because hw doesn't get done...English is just gay with DW quizzes left and right. Kyle and I were imagining yesterday Mrs. Kelley tripping on all of her electrical wires that she always complains about, and hitting her head on the desk net to her desk, and laying kind of in a fetal position on the floor, with eyes closed and papers strewn all over the floor and the class just staring at her limp, prostrate, comatose, half-dead form. We were cracking up. :-D    Hope Kelly and Sam and everyone did well on Pre-cal!   I can't really talk much now. Hw calls... oh, my streak is broken- 3 weeks, 2 days. A new record. Yahoo. I'm not excited. BUt track will be absolutely friggin fun tomorrow, with 16 400's!!!!!! The hardest workout of the year, and it's the day before our practice meet! Hooray! Hey, I want you guys to come see one of my track meets sometime. They're pretty cool, and all I ask is that you just stay for my race, which will only last like, 5 minutes. Your encouragement would mean a lot to me....   Girls do not melt from eating nothing but Jell-O.........   Song of the day is "You Know You're Right" by Nirvana. It's that one that was only recently released due to Kurt Cobain's anal-retentive wife, Courtney Love, holding it back from the radio and stuff. It's not a great song, but I kinda like it. And...... freeze. Sorry if I regaled everyone with all of my stupid, petty, not-really-mattering problems at any time. I know you really don't wanna hear about them, or don't care. But hey, "that's the life I live....the lonesooooome kickerrrrrr." - courtesy of Adam Sandler. Right. Class dismissed.   God blessSup all of you crazy possums. Now, make like a possum and play dead. It's so much fun. I could be really dead, and no one would know the difference. "Soy un perdador...I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me?" Ah, Beck. You speak only too true.   I had a great time last night. More so than I thought I might at a soccer game. Man, Klein totally kicked some A, and that was cool. I got to sit under a blankie with the always lovely Kelly A, and then I even got to sit with the "popular" people donw the bleachers. You know, all those dudes and dudettes who acknowledge our presence, but really don't care? Yes, them (Sam not included- I know she's ginuwine....I think). Well, I sat with them for a while, and they didn't mind me being there, and I even made a funny or two that aroused a slight snicker form some. Oh! And I saw Cole Wilson, who I haven't seen since like, 6th or 7th grade. He and I used to be kinda good buds in our younger days. I remember he and Amanda Vatne (when I adored her) sorta dated, and I was way jealous of him. He also has two different color eyes. Cool, huh? I do too, but mine are not noticeable as his. Well, after the soccer game, Kyle played taxi/ chauffer, and then we went to Sam's. Kyle is a balla on the piano. "Under the Sea" has gotta be one of my all-time favorite py-anna tunes. Ha ha, then  we started watching my truly all-time favorite movie, "Monty Python and the Holy Grail." Ah, a classic it be. "WHAT...is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?"  "He's a scary monster, with sharp teeth; like THIS!...*chomp chomp chomp*"  "It's only a wee bunny rabbit!" "Help! Help! I'm being repressed!"   Hahahahahaahahahahahaha.....oh, geez, that movie gets me every time. And when I watch it with friends, it makes it all the more better, such as was the case last night. Oh, guys? I apologize for quoting that movie left and right, and perhaps ruining the experience for you. I know it got so much better after I left. Please forgive me for my outbursts. I know George was pissed.... but as I say, I'm sorry.   Man, Kyle and I went running yesterday and I almost killed him! We "liberated" some tennis balls from behind Giammalva, after we saw Georgie-Porgie practicing there. Also, we found a piece of wood that was only like a quarter-inch thick. Well, we played baseball (or cricket- whichever y'all would prefer to call it) and I swung, and connected. A long sharp half of that piece of wood went flying at Kyle's head, spinning and floating in th air. Only by Divine Providence did it swerve in mid-air, missing his face by like a foot, and it the proceeded to hover in the air for another three seconds or so, making erratic loops in the air. It was just hovering there, and it was so cool, despite the fcat that Kizzyle almost died. So sorry, dude. I didn't do it on pupose- and if I did, it woulda hit you instead of turning.  BUT I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO KYLE!!!!! Or anyone, for that matter.   I had to go home last night at 10, because I had SAT's this morning at Spring High School. That was a fun experience...I have only taken the PSAT before, and this was similar, and just as long and boring. All I want is a 1400...please, God, a 1400....it's all I ask.  I saw Jessica Hulsebosch and Lucy Nguyen (I'm never sure on spellings for those names, ha ha) and that was cool. We were like the only people from Klein there. And as I drove home and passed Klein, I saw all your cars there, cuz you suckers were still taking the test there! Hahahah, suckers. Wait, I just said that....   Song of the day: "Thundercats" by Relient K. Wow, it's great. Kizzyle and I love to jam to it in his Grand Am while cruising the main drag, looking for 3rd or 4th grade chicks to hit on. "Hanging out, at the lair; Snarf and me, and the twins...my favorite feline is the one who wore cheetah skins...Fighting evil; we drink milk and we purr a lot... ask me to cross them, and I would say I'd rather nooot. I'd rather nooooooot.....        I'm Lion-oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo." Ah, woohoo....   I had Spaghettios for lunch. Mm-mmm, good.  :-)    Well, nothing else interesting to discuss right now. Class dismissed.   God blessHow's it going all of you dogs and frogs? Now you have to jump around and ribbit, or crawl around on all fours and bark. Remember, you're supposed to be acting like whatever animal I make you at the beginning of all my blogs. Fun, ain't it? Just do it...froggy style or doggy style; it's your choice. ;-)   Well, I recently discovered that my sister's friend calls me "hottie-hottie-hot-hot" to all of her munchkin buddies. As much of a compliment as that is (and who am I to argue with it? Ha ha, j/k. I know I'm a scrawny little dude who just happens to have a great 6-pack and has toned arms. Not muscular, mind you -like Kyle; he's a beast, but toned.) Well, I have been receiving admiration from girls four years younger than me for most of my life, but none from people MY age. Except for Tammy, and she's ONE year younger than I am, so I guess that's not too bad. My master plan is for Kelly to get some pics of me not wearing a shirt, and being in muscularly revealing poses, and she just "accidentally" shows them to some of her friends that go to Klein and CFBC and stuff. She said she'd set me up on a blind date at some point, but she still hasn't found my "match" yet. Too bad. If any of you guys: know, are involved with, or  are  someone with a crush on me, lemme know, and I'll see what I can do for the lucky lady who fancies my attention. Oh my god... I'm so sorry everyone. I know this seems VERY egotistical and  desperate , and it is. I apologize for my lack of candor and for my narcissistic ramblings. Please forgive me; I'm working on remedying the problem. I've only this year kinda raised my confidence level- if you have any doubts about that, look at my freshman yearbook picture; I was very timid and reserved- and am hoping to blossom and FINALLY get a girlfriend and my first kiss. Ahh, love....   "I'm sick of smiling...and so is my jaw... can't you see my front is dropping down? I'm sick of beng someone I'm not...please get me out of this slump." NFG again, folks. Gosh, they're great. " But you're  getting worse; I swear it...it's hard to prove you're an understatement.  But you're   getting worse, and I know....that you'll be calling, calling, calling me again."   Constantinople was once the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. A hummingbird weighs less than a penny. Your heart beats 100,000 times a day. But mine beats more when I'm around pretty girls. :-)    My streak will be three weeks tomorrow! Yahoo! I once had one last three weeks before, and so if I can make it through tomorrow, I break my own record! Weeee! But Javier, being the Spanish stud he is, has a much longer streak than I do. Grrr...him and his Spanish hotness.    I fond a kick-A Harry Potter letter jacket, that is too small for me, but I'm gonna wear it anyway. It's got a "G" where the K is on Klein's jackets, and on the left sleeve, it says "7" and underneath, "SEEKER." On the back, it says "GRYFFINDOR" and there's a lion's head underneath the word. It's tight- in two ways. Number one, it's cool, and number two, it's way too small, and so it's not loose-fitting. My parents want me to bring it back to Theiss and turn it in to the lost-and-found, because, "It belongs to someone, and they're probably looking for it." Sheesh. Can't I ever have nice things?    In case you couldn't tell, the song of the day is "Understatement" by New Found Glory. Just to let ya know....  Right. I can't think of anything else to write about right now. If any of you guys ever want anything in my blog that you feel is worth mentioning, just email me at: blinky_04@hotmail.com. It'll be great fun. Class dismissed.   God blessHey chickadees. This one should be easy- I guess you should just whistle like a birdie and flap around. Here are some random statements I created this evening that I felt just had to be put down: Many chickens like to dance barefoot on the grave of Colonel Sanders. Jake Plummer could hurl a taquito across Memorial Northwest if he really tried. Your mom is hot. :-)  There should be twice as many fans of the Harvard football team as there are of Miami. " 'Look at all of the purple and pink!'  'Why is our money so gay?' "- The Simpsons, when they go to Brazil, and a ransom is paid for Homer, because he gets kidnapped. Crocodiles might never wear flamenco hats. Cornucopia souns like something that is on the bottom of someone's foot. "I like big blogs, and I cannot lie; you other bloggers can't deny- when a girl walks in and she's all up in your face, you can write about it in your blog, and take up lots of space, and get sprung!" Onomatopoeia is a buzzword. Ha ha, get it? It truly is a buzzword, but i used an onomatopoeia in "buzzword." What a clever trick. I was also wondering if Sam knows what "wonky" means. I saw in the dictionary yesterday that is is a term used in British slang. I'll test her knowledge of it tomorry. Also, does anyone know what "wonderwall" means? As in the Oasis song? Julie says the song is about birth control, so maybe the "wonderwall" is a diaphragm? I don't know....   Lastly, The Munsters could kick the Addams Family's butt any day. So there. Class dismissed.   God blessHey crackas and antelopes. I have no idea what sound an antelope makes, but you'd better be making it right now. A small matter concerning my blogs- a lot of people who read them (not to name any names *cough* erin *cough* among others) just kinda skim them. People, these are here for your entertainment and to fill you in on the goings-on of my life. If you don't wanna read the whole thing, you're not getting the whole blogging experience. It's worth it, I think. So, come on, read it all or none. "Sank you."    Well, I had a fairly good day today. To start off, everyone liked my new shoozies, and that made me feel pretty kick-ass for only having the best footwear in the school. "Ha ha" to all of you who think otherwise. I repeat, "ha ha."   Holy crap, I'm so sick of "Hey Jude." I've heard that song like 3 times a day for the past 2 weeks. It ain't bad, but I don't wanna be listenin' to it no more. Anywho, we had a sub in English, and that was great, and I stole some croutons from the english department breakroom to "balance out the universe" for all of the times Mrs. Kelley and/ or Mrs. Eichhorn has screwed me over. I think I may need more compensation.... Man, track kicked butt today- my butt that is. 4 sets of 1200's at under 4 minute pace. Ha, Coach Yates- like that's gonna happen! Well, I ran hard anyway; my best 1200 was at 4:08, and worst at 4:18. It hurt. A lot. I'm so tired. Kyle and Andrew, you must be glad you quit track. But tomorrow we have a fun 40-minute run at Meyer, and Friday..ohhh, Friday. We have a 1600 (one-mile) time trial! YAHHOOOOOOO!!!!  I love the mile! It's my favorite race, and my goal for this year is to break 5:00. I know I can do it. "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." Wow, the mile is just SO much fun....unlike the 800....*shudder*     Yeah. Oasis is pretty cool. Such as on a Saturday Night live skit: There's a buncha people in the British Parliament, and one dude stands up and says, "Is Oasis not the greatest British rock band of all time?" And everyone gets pissed at him (you know- cuz they're British [no offense, Sam and Co.]; and it's Parliament, and you're supposed to be serious) and the overseer is like, "Mr. Murdoch, that's the third time this past month you've mentioned Oasis! Now sit down!" And it goes on a little bit, but it's pretty funny.   There are two songs of the day today: "Born to Run" by Bruce Springsteen is the first. It's a great song about breaking free and stuff like that. My favorite part goes like this: "Wendy, let me in, I wanna be your friend; I wanna guard your dreams and visions...just wrap your legs round these velvet rims and STRAP YOUR HANDS CROSS MY ENGINES!!" That's an innuendo if I've ever heard one...  The other song is "Margaritaville" by Jimmy Buffet. As was told earlier in one of my blogs, if (and that's a BIG if) I get into Heaven, I will be on some awesome tropical beach, and this song (along with steel-drum music) will be playing in the background perpetually. Ahh, the beach.... I wish I was there now...   Kelly didn't want my Kleenexes... :-(  But it's ok. I'm actually glad she gave them away- that's what Jesus woulda done. Hooray for Kellys! :-)   K, I'm gonna jet for now- Thinkfive for bonus points in Calculus! Yahoo!  OK; class dismissed.   God blessHey platypus rexes. From now on, everyone who reads this will temporarily become whatever animal I call you at the beginning of my blog here. So you have to make the noises and the gestures and habits that that animal would do as you read my blog. So, whatever sound a platypus makes, reproduce that sound.   Not much time tonight, as history must be completed, and Lil' Sis wants to talk to her monkey-friends on AIM. What platypuses....   Aywho, most important order of business; I patched things up with British Spy. We had been, rather...tense, i guess one could say, and I realized that I was being very immature and stupid and stuff and didn't like not seeing her anymore, so I decided to change that. Yay, we are buds again. Whoop-dee-doo for Catmandu!   Right; well, song of the day is "Hey Jude" by the Beatles today, because that's what I'm listening to now. yay.   God blessHey all you crazy squirrel-monsters. I have had a great weekend so far. I love not having school today! I need to get my history project done I guess, so I can turn it in early for 5 points. Maybe I'll do it late tonight. As usual......so life goes.   I had an interesting convo with one my friends yesterday, and we straightened some stuff out, and I am glad it's all straightened out. I'm talking about God, guys. I sat outside after Kelly left my home for like 20 minutes, talking to God out loud, and trying to figure out my life. I asked Him to help all you folks out, so if things go your way, think of Him, and thank Him; ha, and maybe me too, cuz I instigated the help...I dunno. Or not. I really got quite a few things figured out through His divine inspiration and stuff, and I like that. It's made me feel a lot better.    I also talked to another good friend and got some more stuff straightened out between them and I. I'm glad everything worked out well; I wouldn't want any weirdness hanging around- that would put a damper on things. But I think maybe our frendship (maybe, I really don't know) is stronger because of it, now that we each know where the position is. Boogity.   I like chicken, I like liver; Meow Mix, Meow Mix, please deliver...   I so need to write some funny stuff, but I can't think of anything! Grrr!!!  "This mom is your mom, this mom is my mom; from California, to the New York Islands....from the Redwood forests, to the Gulf Stream waa-aaa-teeerrrs....this mom was made for you and me....."   "In case you couldn't tell, I'm gonna jump down a well, rescue the girl from the Ring and we'll do that thang - so bad it will be, can't you see how you mean so much to me , baby, and I love your touch so much it makes me wild you freaky child, I want your body all night, don't put up a fight, you know it's right, cuz we see the light, and it tells us to eat jello... on your pillow in the room, take out a broom, and sweep me off my feet, you can't be beat, I Iove you girl, you're my whole world. Upside down and all around you make me wanna act the clown, make it funny, eat some honey off your lips, they're sweet to kiss, I want you to know it's the way to go, when we make love, below or above, it doesn't matter, help me; I'm addicted to you, so convicted to...the notion that you love me too."      That was my flow that I just made up on the spot; hope you like it. Well, I'm going running now with Kyle and Kelly (Greg, that is) and won't be back for about an hour. So, if you wanted to talk to me, sucks for you; you can't. But wait, I know someone that DIDN'T wanna talk to me; they blocked me from their instant messenger list thingy...I feel so rejected....not. It's better this way, down by the bay, eating hay- I just may; whaddya say?   God blessok, the thing didn't work. I try again later.   God blessHey folks. Just a quick one for now. i added a message thingy so you guys can comment on my blog after you read it and it'll be on the site. try it. I hope it works.     God blessHowdy, bumblebees. I did eventually get some sleep (10 a.m. -2p.m.) and I was kinda rested. Kelly called from her work to talk, and I was happy about that. She had a list of people in her head that she would make that random phone call to, and I was picked! Yayyy! it was like The Price is Right: "Sean Murphy, come on dooowwnnn!!!" I felt so honored that she would pick me out of all of her friends to call. *Tear*....  Guys, I know you're sick of hearing about her, (hopefully you're not though, and either way, you don't have a choice: it's MY blog! Suckers.) but Kelly is such an awesome person. She just brightens my day so much whe I'm around her or even on the phone with her as was the case earlier. Her waist also fits well into the crook of my arm as we ride upon a 50-cent car outside Kroger in freezing temperatures with Kyle to the extreme left. Also, she just has this way of looking into your eyes, and it's like she's searching your soul to bring all your goodness and happiness to the surface, and that is just amazing. AND SHE'S A SKY PERSON!!!! Yahoo! In truth, she (and Sandra too) got me hooked on the sky. It's God's palette for us, and it is wonderful, people; you should appreciate it as much as we do! Appreciate it.... Like from the Simpsons, you know? When Homer tells someone to do something, such as waive an airport tax... ah, nevermind. Only Crystal and I watch that show anymore. But Kelly is extremely wonderful and outstanding! Get to know her, everyone! WEEE!! Hooray for Kellies!    Right- mommy says bedtime now. That sucks. Before I go, though, here's the song of the day: "Screaming Infidelities" by Dashboard Confessional. That is Kyle and I's song, it seems, as it describes our situation: "As for now I'm gonna hear the saddest songs, and sit alone and wonder...how you're making out......and as for me I wish that I was anywhere, with anyone, making out.."   Yup. Well, gotta jet.   God blessGood morning to all, and to all a good night! It sure feel like I should be sleeping now. I stayed up all night at Lazer Quest eith Christie's church, and Kelly, and Kyle, and you know the rest. Well, I had a total blast except for when I got Coca-Cola on my new jeans. That part was stupid. Huh huh huhuhuhuh... So, we played like 10 games of lazer tag, and I got the highest rank out of any of the Klein "group" we were with when I got 3rd place in the first round. I then proceeded to get a lower rank in every subsequent round. We met this pretty cool Argentinian dude named Alejandro and some Cy Fair chicks who were freshman, but one of them was not bad, if you know what I mean. In case you didn't know that means she was not bad looking; cute; almost hot. Whatever. We all played hackey-sack, and Kelly began to learn how to kick my sack around. We all had Whataburger at like 3 in the morning, and afterwards, our "group" as I shall again call it went to IHOP for brekkist. Kelly and I split a wonderful meal of bacon, egss, hash browns, pancakes, and sausage. Elizabeth ate powdered sugar. Kyle had French toast cuz he is "jay swee la june fee." If you're French or speak it, sound that out and you know what I'm saying. I don't know how to spell it in French...   After brekkist, Kelly and I went to Meyer Park to watch the sunrise, and it was amazing! We sat on the hood and leaned back against the windshield, and took in the glorious (albeit rather cold) morning. The pink, mostly orange, and the blue were awesome and it was really nice just laying there and appreciating it and everything I have and...and... *sigh* Guys, Kelly is such an awesome person. I am very priveleged to know her, and you guys are too. I'm so glad she's my friend; my life has only gotten better since I've known her. I believe the same could go for Kyle as well; he is a great guy who's strong in his faith, no matter how long his streaks are. Ha ha. He is my best friend (along with Andrew- they're joint best friends to me) and he has helped me through a lot and I thank him greatly for that. We are almost always in tandem, and I love that; it makes life interesting. It's nice to know I have someone I can really truly count on. Thanks, Kyle and Kelly.   I am so dead tired but Kelly says it's not really staying up all night unless you don't get any sleep until the next night. So, I'll try to accomplish that; it may be hard, but hey: "I can do all things throgh Christ who strengthens me." Well, Jesus, help me through  long day of nothing but tiredness and homework, and (maybe) if I get done with hw, I can see my friends later tonight or this evening. Also, help Kelly, cuz she has to work 9-4, then 5-10. She will  really  need your help in making this ou to not be a bad day for her. And also help Kyle, cuz he's working 4-9, and will also be very tired. AND, help all my friends in everything they do ytoday! yes, even BriSpy, now matter how adamant she may be about anything.   Melissa, I'm sorry we left you yesterday with no one to talk to but Austin Powers. We thought about you constantly throughout the night (well, Iguess it was morning, technically) wondering if you were still sitting at your computer waiting for someone to get online so you'd have some companionship. Right, well, you can have my companionship this weekend; just gimme a call   Allrighty, I gotta jet and finish up my diddley history notes. Party on with tha people in tha house!!!! "What? What?" Sure. peace out, suckas.   God blessBeofre Kizzyle comes to get me, I have some interesting trivia for you folks who might care... *Ahem* "Bingo" rearranged spells "boing." The capital of the Philipines is Manila. Elvis died (supposedly) August 16, 1977. Charles Lindbergh-the dude who made the first solo flight across the Atlantic- died August 26, 1984. My dog's name is Callie. I run track. The sky is blue because of the angle the sun reflects off of the water vapor on the air. Kyle's dog is named Kali. Kyle says hi to Melissa on my instant messenger. "Meet Virginia Woolf" was the first movie to have nudity in it. 0 degrees Celsius is equal to 32 degrees Farenheit. The temperature right now is 31 degrees Farenheit. I only have like, 1 or 2 moles on my entire body. Sweet, eh? Napoleon was defeated at the battle of Waterloo. "Able was I, ere I saw Elba" is a palindrome, and has to do with Napoleon. Your mother's brother's wife's daughter's dad's brother-in-law is your dad. You smell bad. Kobe is some sort of Japanese steak. Melissa has 6 toes on her left foot. Anyway, Kyle and I are going to Starbuck's now to get hyper on coffee so we can stay up alll night. DIGGETY!!!!  Right, well, peace out.   God blessHello and buenos dias to all my senoritas out there. Holla!  Well, I went to Kelly's violin recital yesterday, and she played awesome. Oh, funny incident: we were there, hangin out, and she was getting her instrument tuned. her teacher shows up, saying "Hey, How's it going?" etc. Well, then she goes, "Do you have your music?" and Kelly just freezes. We were like, "Oh, snap..." But through divine intervention and her own good memory, Kelly pulled her piece off without a hitch (as far as I could tell). But yeah, she played really well, and I loved being there to support her and say, "Yay, Kelly! You are the shiznat!" I think she did awesome, and I'm proud of her....  but not to the extent that I feel like her parents or something. That's just creepy. And I almost died yesterday. No other details on that.   I'm so excited because tonight I get to stay awake forever, and play Lazer tag with Kyle, and Kelly, and Christie, and Elizabeth McClung. Woo hooo! Go Banana man and....I need a nickname. I will have one by tomorrow, considering our games will be over and I will have had to think of one to play... But anyways, I'm pumped. Like a Swedish pump enlarger. Rigghhht....   I am finished with my english hw.. boo ya to Mrs. Kelley's class who I KNOW hasn't started yet! Suckers! Anyways, I need to get started on my nine pages of history notes that Christie assigned me... I will shoot her good and hard for that... Well, I will get to stepping now.   Song of the day: "Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees. Maurice Gibbs (pronounced Morris, not More- ees) died this past week, and he was truly a forerunnner in the art of disco. Right. Gotta jet.   God blessYo diggety I say; yo diggety.  Sorry I haven't updated in a while, I've just been busy and lazy...bazy, I guess you could say. Right. Well, not too much interesting has been going on recently, but I got grounded for getting an 80 on that physics test. Not for the fact that an 80 wasn't good enough, but that I didn't study for it. Pshaw- I don't need to study- I'm all-lknowing and supreme. NOT. If anything, I could say I know a lot, but all-knowing? That's gotta be Raj. Just kidding again, guys.  God  is really omnipotent (and omniscient!) so He is really the one that kicks serious butt.   Well, I am saying sorry to Kyle for what I have done to him. I know I've kinda been screwing around behind his back some, but I am not sure if it meant anything. I don't know! Well, I am glad we patched things up, but he will be taken down by me in Lazer Tag on Friday. Read his blog for more info on that.   Man, I cranked out a well-timed and scathing insult against Mo today. Sorry Mo- I know you don't have the willie of a six-year old.....a four-year old, maybe...  Anywho, Me, Tard, Mo, and Marvelous Melissa were walking to english from lunch and Monster Mo was telling us about a new disease he heard about. Well, he was like, "There's  this disease called 'micro-penis.' It's when..." and then I cut in, and said, "It's when you're ASIAN!!" And Monstrous Mo, being Asian, only felt obliged to agree. Meanwhile, Magnificent Melissa and Tard are in hysterics, falling all over themselves laughing. I felt pretty good about myself just then- I think I may actually have a sense of humor!    Ok, I need to finish up so I can do....calculus (insert word of enjoyment and excitement here)________!!!!!!  I need to put in some "I have's" for O.   *Ahem* I have eaten a doughnut off the floor of the band hall in 6th grade that had been there for 2 days. I have gone three weeks without breaking my streak. I have been seen picking my nose by a girl I liked. I have been made fun of for my small size. I should use "build" there don't you think? I didn't mean a sexual size, but my body itself is tiny....whatever.  I have been "alone in Paris" like Helen Loomis from Dandelion Wine. I have been to a circus and wondered if the animals were ever abused. I have to do my homework... I have driven alone before I got my license. I have thrown those spiky, sphere-shaped thingies that fall off the trees into my next door neighbor's pool. I have to go now.   Song of the day: Yes, I realize I  may  be copying this feature from someone, but I love the idea of it. "Daydream Believer" by the Monkees. I need to revise what I had written a few days ago- it really goes like this: "Oh, I could hide 'neath the wings, of the bluebird as she sings...the 6 o'clock alarm will never ring......but it rings, and I rise.... wipe the sleep out of my eyes.... my shavin' razor's cold, and it stings."   Peace out suckas.   Oh, a VERY inspiring quote that I recite to myself all the time now (thanks again, Kelly!) " I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." I don't know the book, the chapter or the verse, but I love that quote.   God blessHey folks and blokes and artichokes. Today was interesting. I had a dang Physics test that sucked monkey hair, and a US History quiz that no one knew the right answers to. And Dandelion Wine! Sheesh! I hate english... Aw, heck. I'll come right out and say it- I hate school! I mean if it weren't for the fact that I get to see all my friends and stuff, it would be absolutely miserable.   Speaking of friends, here's a paragraph devoted to one of mine (I hope she feels the same way!) who definitely deserves more blog time. Of course I'm talking about Christie Mechler! This girl is smart (you have NO idea!), cute, sexy, funny, interesting, and an all-around cool person. She sits next to me in History, and I thoroughly enjoy hearing about her crazy weekends and how many times she's seen "Pride and Prejudice." Ha ha, Christie is one of those chicks that makes your day interesting just to have talked to her; she can make you feel great, or deliver a totally scathing and well-deserved put-down if you're stupid enough to be an idiot around her. There is only one Christie, and for that I am glad- I don't know if I could handle two girls with as much fire and passion as she has in her! She's "fo sho" a bitchin' person. No, not a BITCH, a bitchin' person. You people need to learn the difference before I bash your heads in with my huge, rippling muscles....Here's to Christie!   The more I think about religion, the more I get screwed up in my religious views. I had a wonderful, deep conversation with Kelly yesterday about how I know that I'm going to hell (which I am, people! As of right now, you can't convince me otherwise!  :-)  ) I'm not wallowing in self-pity over it, I just have accepted the fact that I will be looking up at everyone whom I love so much having a great time in Heaven without me, and it will be the absolute worst punishment the devil can conjure for me. Yes, Kyle, even worse than repeat 400s. Ha ha, but kelly pointed out some interesting things to me, which I may have to take to heart and muse over, and she gave me this great Bible verse that I looked at periodically throughout the day, and it really made me feel better. Here it is for all who give a care: " 'For I know the plans I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'Plans to prosper you and not to harm you. Plans of a hope and a future.' " Jeremiah 29:11.    I need to get started on my 3 PROBLEMS OF MATH HOMEWORK!!!! Yeah, baby, it's like nothing! Hooray!  But I'll try and be online later to talk withyou mugs. Peace out.   God blessHey-o. Just a quick one tonight, with some lyrics from two of the songs that are on my new CD. Thank you, Casey!!    Fire and Rain  by James Taylor: "Won't you look down upon me, Jesus? .....You gotta help me make a stand.....Just got to see me through another day......My body's achin' and my time is at hand....I won't make it any other way."    Little Black Backpack  I believe this one is by Stroke 9. The parts in quotes are higher than the other lyrics...as in more of a feminine voice, you know...   "Don't want to... don't wanna talk about it;  'I say why not?'...  Don't wanna think about it; 'I say there's got to be' some good reason for your little black backpack, up smack, turn around he's on his back... Don't wanna tango with you, I'd rather tango with him; I think I'm gonna bash his head in...This shouldn't concern you except that   just don't expect to get your bloody black backpack back." Thanks Kelly, for introducing me to this really cool song.   Well, its 9:00. On a Saturday night. And I'm about to go to bed. I'm just  that  tired. Yup, well peace out, guys. have a great one.   God blessHello, Clarice. Man, Elvis and I and all his party-goers -including his hot and recently divorced daughter- had a great time at his birthday bash on Wenesday. Lotsa good cake and peanut butter-and-banana sandwiches. Melissa thinks it's stupid that I write about him, but he's the King of Rock 'n' Roll! I mean, what am I supposed to do, just ignore him?! I don't THINK so...   I had a good night tonight (well, actually it's morning now) and had a great deal of fun. Yo yo yo. First Kizzyle and I went to the mall and got some stuff for hisself, and his BK Ball tux. Then, we went to my house, and we thought that Kelly wouldn't be able to go to Oriental Garden and watch Billy Madison cuz of her BPA commitments, but then Austin pulled a classic British Spy move and backed out of his engagement to work at K's house. Wa na naa.....Jack Bandit!    Well, we ended up going to the Chinese place, and I gorged myself on spicy beef and broccoli, much to the amusement of Kelly and Kyle and Kelly Osman. Why do all of my friends' names start with K? It's like KKK...weird.  Oh, it was funny at the eatery when we did "the wave" to the next level- coughing. We all took turns coughing in a sequential order, until all the people in the restaurant were looking at us. That was neat. Then, Kyle started to tell me about some Christian sex book at his workplace, and he was like, "After she wakes up, you're not supposed to..." and he never got to finish becuase I was laughing so hard because into my mind sprung the notion, "Why would she be  waking up? . Wait, she musta been date-raped!"  I dunno- it was absolutely hilarious at the time. Guess you had to be there.   Oh, speaking of the big bad K-man himself, he now has his own blog- hooray! Visit it at www.k-berker.blogspot.com.   It's rathah funny. Melissa is MMM...what a ho. Not really, Mel. You are tizzight. But not as tizzight as Casey, who finally made me my mix CD of kick-ass songs! They include such classics as "Born to Run" by Bruce Springsteen; "Leavin' on a Jet Plane," by Peter, Paul and Mary; "I'm an Asshole"- a very funny comedy song by Dennis Leary; and "Daydream Believer" by The Monkees. Can't beat the Monkees.   "Ride upon the wings, of the bluebird as she sings... my shaving razor's cold, and it stings..." I'm not sure about that very beginning part, but it's something about "the bluebird as she sings." Whatever. I haven't gotten my CD yet, because I have to wait until tomorrow (today) to retrieve it from Casey's faraway home in Terranova West....   ANYwho... after Oriental Garden, Kellies and I went to Kyle's abode and watched Billy Madison, and that was such a sweet movie. I don't mean sweet as in "Awww, he filled your room with roses; that's sweet..." but as in, "Dude, that guy falling down the stairs was sweet!" Ah yes, Kyle and I fell down his stairs today and that kinda hurt. After the movie, we played Bond on PS2, and that was tight. Unlike Bev, who is very loose. Well, after that, we went and played "football" in the street, and Kyle and Kelly flirted with each other, and that was fun too! But sadly, Kellies had to leave and so KB and I came up here to create Kyle's blog and look up midget porn. J/k about the midget porn... it was sodomy we were after.  ;-)       School sucks.     I need to get some sleep, so I will finish up with some wunnerful "I have never's."  *Ahem*   I have never loaded a desk upon a trampoline to hoard acorns in. I have never thought I had buns of steel. I have never run more than 10 miles at once. I have never groped a star-nosed mole until he was "tickled pink." I have never tickled a fancy, nor have I farkled (or is it farcled?). I have never put paper towels inside my backpack to absorb my fluid outpouring during "that time of the month." I have never sprayed Cheez Wiz into Mrs. Kelley's face...yet. I have never thrown a giraffe through a stained-glass window. I have never ordered a half-crazed Mississippi squirrel at McDonald's. If any of you have ever heard of Ray Stevens, his Mississippi Squirrel Revival song is funny. I have never lifted weights while listening to "Macho Man" by the Village People. I have never phoned Korea and asked them to stop the fighting, please. I have never been to Bearkadette Ball. I have never taken a computer speaker and tried to poke out a blind man's liver. I have never punched a drunk in the groin, but I bet that would be fun. However, I have punched one in the arm...we traded hits. That was interesting... Last but certainly not least, I have never committed immoral acts with any article of my sister's clothing.  Speaking of sisters and clothing, mine borrows my shirts to wear. She wore my Tobasco shirt yesterday (since it is 2:00 in the morning, and technically, that was yesterday). Is that wrong when a manly, buff, ripped, strong..............scrawny, homely, ugly, smelly, weak high school junior is the same size as a seventh-grade girl?   Riiigghht. Well, I gotta jet- I'm tired. I think Kyle is already asleep....excellent. Now I can touch him in obscure areas, and he won't know it. NOT REALLY!!!! Man, you whackos....have a great day.   God blessHi-ho diggety. Before I start anything, HAPPY BIRTHDAY, ELVIS!!!! You are 68 years young today! Keep on pumping out those rock-and-roll hits. We love em!   Anywho...Man, Mrs. Kelley is a biatch. Melissa and I walked in late, along with a few others on the second "ding" of the bell, and Mrs. Kelley was like, "You guys are late." I was like, "Dammit," and then somewhat quietly (for myself and for those in the class) I said mildly, "But the bell was still ringing..." Then Devil-Woman was like, "Get over here," in the same voice the character Scorpion uses in Mortal Kombat...you guys know what I'm talking about- the one that sounds like the earth is ripping apart and hell is unleashing into your soul. She went on some tirade about how I was being disrespectful, and how if we wanted teachers for future generations, us students had better work on fixing that problem, and how I WAS tardy, cuz I wasn't in my seat before the bell rang, and how I was an overall idiot. Hmm, I have been called that quite a bit recently...  Anyways, I sat down, sheepishly (though inside I was cracking up at how stupid she was) and it turned out she didn't even mark me tardy! What a dirty ho-bag with no memory. Well, her husband died last year, so I guess I should feel sorry for her, but I don't!    I pulled out an 80 in calculus for the semester! Hooray! Only the hardest class of all time and I have a B average. Party time, guys. Seriously. Everyone who reads tihs come over to my house on Friday night, and bring strippers and all types of fun things (or people) to do. No alkee-hall, though. So sorry.    Well, I've figured out what would make my life so so so much better. I need to stop brooding on all the things I don't have, such as a girlfriend, great grades, popularity, running speed, not seeing Andrew or Kyle anymore, good looks, charm, suave, sophistication, not "getting any," and a lot of things that are good. What I DO need to do is focus on the things I am fortunate enough to have in my life: health, somewhat decent running ability, good grades, knowledge of 50 million articles of useless trivia and even things that are useful, good grades, GREAT friends who DO care about me, driving ability, the sky, fun classes, wonderful family, and the hopes that someday I wil find a girl for me. Right. Just learn to look at the good things, and life should improve. I hope.   We started stage combat today in theater arts, and I am in a group with not one, but TWO hot chicks. The always lovely Erin, and Holly Olson, who has improved in the looks department since 8th grade. Not to say she was ugly, but she has "blossomed" if I may use Andrew's word for someone that I can't mention right now. He knows who I'm talking about. Well, she is really cute and stuff, and Erin is just like, WOW, and there is a lot of physical contact between partners, so Lord knows I'm gona enjoy this project.    :-)   Well, Thinkfive calls, so I will jet for now. Peace out, suckas.    God blessAllrighty, some "I have's" so Kelly Osman will be happy. Here goes: I have thought that kissing a girl's leg would qualify for my first kiss whe I was in third grade. I have been wrapping, and NOT regretted it- only the consequences for my good friend K. I have eaten a fish eye for a dollar, but I never got the dollar. I have flown an airplane and had a mysterious urge to crash it. I have lounged around in my boxers in front of teenage girls who thus laughed at my inadequate endowment. I have been to Mexico and refused a vendor selling my a "sterling silver" necklace for 4 pesos. I have drank dishwasher fluid cuz I thought it was lemonade. I have killed a mockingbird- I know, it's a sin.   Well, I think my "never" life is more interesante than my real one. Whatever. I WANNA HEAR YOUR WEIRD EXPERIENCES. The reason that's in bold is cuz no one ever responds to anything I ever write in here, ever. Whatever- gotta jet.   God bless.Hidee-ho. Well, someone is a little touchy! Just cuz their house got wrapped, they are quite torqued off. Well, we didn't mean to piss her off, and I guess we are sorry. I'm not Kelly, so I don't know if she is or not. And I KNOW I PUT IT IN MY BLOG. Kelly even said I should probably take it out before that person reads it, and I just said, "Nah." I was wondering if they could put two and two together and figure out it was us. But we really didn't mean to "inconvenience" -as it was so put- her dad. And she's right- he is cool. I wouldn't want to make him go to any trouble for us for any stupid reason such as the one we just did. Sorry, Mr. Soul! Sam, you better show that to him- I don't want him to hate me (or Kelly, for that matter). And I am talking to her right now,and she says she is sorry too. Well, this has been one big stinking mess......I'll update later, guys.   God bless.Yo diggity. Being home rocks, but unfortunately, tonight was my last free night before school. I made the most of it though. First, I...did some stuff. I just blanked out, and can't remember what I did. Well, Kyle and I went to Casey's and saw Mel, Crys, Case, and Drew.    Well, we went back to Kelly's and played Crazy Taxi for "35 Crazy Minutes." I downloaded some oldies onto her comp. Ha ha, I hope she likes them. Oh, I neglected to mention yesterday that we had also created a fish soap opera, with characters such as Mackenzie, Cornelius, and Sophie. Good times.  Whoa. Deja vu....     OK, she and I are now "New Experiences Buds," and every week (we hope) we will try to introduce the other to a new experience. This week, we exchanged house wrapping for Popeye's chicken. Who knows what's next? The possibilities are endless. I'm hoping she will give me my first blind date; I asked her to set me up with someone -anyone!-  regardless of whether or not they go to Klein. If you guys have some input for a chick for me, lemme hear it. PLEASE! My email is at the top of the page. I also neglected to mention that she fondled my sack, and enjoyed it too! My hackey sack that is. See previous entries for a definition of hackey sack.   I don't wanna go back to school..... More of gay theater arts (and I don't mean sexually gay, just stupid gay), hard running, MRS. KELLEY (bum bum bummmmm), and more dang calculus. Sheesh. Next year had better be easy, or I'm gonna rape a young child.  NOT FREAKING REALLY!!! Gosh, you people will believe anything I put in here.. oh, here's one: Elvis isn't really dead cuz on his tombstone it says "Elvis Aaron Presley." Well, when he was born, his parents were not very smart, and they didn't know how to spell very well, and they named him Elvis Aron Presley. So, theory goes that the real Elvis isn't dead yet cuz they have a different name on the tombstone. Great, huh? It's a true story- really!    OK, "I have never's!" Haven't done these in a while. Here goes: I have never made out with a girl while fantasizing about a Pekignese (I hope that's spelled right.) Come to think of it, I have never made out with a girl! I have never eaten patte amd hoped it was discolored cheese. I have never fumigated an entire roach motel. I have never enjoyed sticking my pinky finger into a rhino's mouth, having it be bit off, then sewed back on again in the ER. I have never had a date to Sadie- hint, girls, hint. I have never careened off of a boulder while doing the Macarena. I have never decapitated a term paper. I have never cohorted with Bonnie and Clyde, nor with Jesse James. I have never negotiated a nuclear arms treaty with Iraq and been successful. Three tries, and they still won't ditch the SCUD missiles! I have never, ever, prepared creme broulee. I have never see a real breast. I came close once, but no cigar. I have never complied to the rules of physics while making a tortilla. I have never believed that a sewing machine couldn't bring my pet lizard Bob (he's real! I had him for like 2 days in the summer after 3rd grade or something. I caught him in our backyard). Last but not least, I have never appreciated my life as much as I did this Christmas break, and I hope I never lose sight of how special, lucky, and blessed I am to be granted the life that I do lead.   Well, it's late- or early, depending on how you look at it, so bedtime for Bonzo! Yeah, you don't have to tell me- I sounded really desperate for some female companionship in ths blog. But now I'll feel stupid if none of you noticed it and by me saying this I brought it to your attention where otherwise it would have remained hidden....oh well. I will catch you groovy cats later.   God blessSup dudes and uh, stuff. I'm finally home! Hooray! I had more fun in WesTex than I thought I would, but hey, whatever. I learned to drive stick shift, which -adhering to popular belief- is more fun to drive than an automatic. It's hard getting started on hills, though. My dad was like, "You just ran into the car behind you and killed their three-month-old baby" like 50 times when I was learning.    Lauren Alvarado called today, asking if I could go to NCL with her tonight. For those of you who went, obviously you knew I didn't make it. I woulda liked to go, but I had prior plans, and also didn't get back in town until like 7:00. Oh, and another thing- my mom gave me the wrong phone number to call her at, and I spent 4 hours calling like every 10-20 mins to let her know I couldn't go, and it was the wrong number...sheesh. But i had fun tonight anyways. A lot of fun.   Kenneth Charles (K.C.) Adams came over and we played some gee-tar and hung out and listened to NFG and stuff. That was fun, cuz we hadn't gotten together for a while. But later, the party really started.   Kelly Michelle Adams (of no relation to Kenneth Charles) and I hung out tonight from like 10:00 till midnight. Since this was the most interesting part of my day, kelly deserves s special section all for our escapades together. First I bought some Reesee's Piecees (yes, I know I spelled it wrong, dimwits) and we were gonna go around the world, but people woulda seen us, and that woulda been weird. So we went to Popeye's and she had a bath, and she enjoyed her first taste of that spicy Cajun fowl. Afterwards, we listened to some NFG in my car (man, they rock!), and then started catapaulting Reesee's Piecees at other cars through my sunroof using the sporks we had from Clog-Your-Arteries-By-Age-24 Popeye's. Then we started trying to catapault them into each other's mouths from a distance of about 10 feet, and eventually we got 2 in each. That was fun. Next, she came over, and saw my huge....backyard. What did y'all think I was gonna say? Geez...Well, she saw that, then we went upstairs and she saw my room and said it was cool. I've never really thought of my room as cool, but hey; whatever. She read my songs, and liked them (yay!) and that was also cool. Hey, my newest song is called Oppressive Parents, and I think it is great. It is pretty much what every teen feels toward their folks at some points, and so it really speaks to people like us. I will show it to anyone willing to read it. Please ask me, so I can show it to you! Well, we then went downstairs and talked some more and ate MORE Reesee's Piecees. Sadly, she had to leave, but then we were on instant messenger, and she said she was going wrapping, but couldnt decide who to wrap. I said I had never been, and why don't we wrap my house? That woulda been cool- my first time wrapping would be my own house. Ha ha, right. Well, we decided to wrap someone else's house instead. They'll figure out it was us once they read this blog. It's not out of spite or anything, just an obvious target and for fun.     OK she's supposed to call soon so we can go, so I'd better jet. "I have never's" next time. Aww, I know you're sad, but whining isn't gonna change anything now, is it?  Riiiight...   God blessHey folks and guys who choke..the chicken. Riiight...  Anyway, I COME HOME TOMORROW!!! Yay! Melissa and I are supposedly gonna chill on Monday, and Kyle and I will do the same on Sunday. It's like my birthday all over again!    Man, the sky here is bee-yoo-tee-fullll. Lemme tell you. The blazing blue, and ohhh, the sunset today! Guys, God is totally awesome (as you can tell, I've been inspired by the sky) and I have been thanking him for everything in my life, and how good I really have it. You guys should do the same, really.   OK, now that I'm done preaching, I have two other weird coincidences to share before I have to get off. I was reading Dandelion Wine- I finished the book!- and Douglas tried to steal some mechanical tarot-card reader, and I was thinking it was like the one in the movie Big, starring Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Perkins. Next thing I know, I go upstairs, and my sister is watching that movie...weird. Another:I logged on earlier today, and I was thinking, "I wonder if Kyle will ever email me like he said he would," and lo and behold, he had. Well, that is my funky day so far. I wil try and update more later. Gotta jet.   God bless.Yo diggity. That's my new phrase; nice, isn't it? Well out here in WesTex it isn't as bad as I though it would be. The scenery and they sky are awesome, and I've been getting in some great running. But I still miss you people. When I get back, Kelly and I are going around the world at a cost of only 50 cents. Boo ya.   We have been riding 4-wheelers, go-karts, trucks, and I've been learning to drive stick-shift. And doing math homework. My god, that part is gay. Oh, I've finished Dandelion Wine. It's not that bad of a book, contrary to popular belief. It is just kinda weird, that's all. There's also been pool, shuffleboard, and cards and stuff. Yippee.    Well, my dad says I have to get offline now. I'll update this later if I can.    God bless.'Ello, 'ello. Boot camp is over. I'm not sure whether to be relieved or sad. It was a great experience, and I had a lot of fun, but I don't want to wake up at 4:20 in the morning everyday. I will miss everyone that I met there and got to know! Except for Kelly- I won't miss her.  Ha ha, because I'll see her everyday at school! You guys...   Kyle Baker is chock full of protein and meaty goodness.   I have a 4-day weekend! "Ha ha," and "In your face!" I say to those who only have a three-day weekend! I get to miss school on Monday to return from N'awlins. Thus I have a four-day school week, a four-day weekend, and another four-day school week, followed by SPRING BREAK!!! Yahhoooooooooo! Yahoo for me and my minimal school skills, and Yahoo for Kellys!   Speaking of Kellys, I hung out for a while yesterday with Kelly O. She's so cool! She had an interview for Duke (speaking of royal titles, whatever happened to the Spherical projectiles Club?) and it seems she did well. We "chilled" at Cypresswood Park, and nearly got attacked by two very rabid raccoons. We talked about anything and everything- she is a very interesting person! EMT, calculus grad, having the name Kelly, "schfifty five"... the list goes on. Kelly, if you're reading this; purple, 2, and sheep! Ha ha, corn is good.   I wish I was a Mouseketeer...     MR. ROGERS DIED!!! Oh my god!!! Where are the horsemen?!   Song of the Day is: "American Pie" by Don Mclean. It's a good song, if you' ve actually heard the verses (*ahem* Kelly A...) and most people know what it's about. But seeing as there are many who don't, I'll enlighten you. The Big Bopper ("Chantilly Lace"), Ritchie Valens (La Bamba), and Buddy Holly (Peggy Sue) were on their way to their next concert city, and were gonna take a bus, but it broke down or something, so they rented a plane on a moderately stormy night, crashed, and died. The song is about the aftermath of "the day the music died." "So bye, bye, Miss American Pie... drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry... them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye, singing, 'This'll be the day that I die..' "   Well, II'm out for now- I'll try and update while in New Orleans. Have a great weekend, and remember this: You won't see Sean even once all weekend long, cuz he'll be far away! Hooray, I know that'll brighten you up!   God blessHola and buenos dias to all my homies out there... pour out a 40 for those who ain't with us today...   I'm in caclulus (of course- where else do I ever blog anymore?) and it's not too bad. Big Bad Dave's coming into town next Friday and he wants to meet some of you people. We oughta hang out next weekend. This weekend I'll be in New Orleans for Mardi Gras! Yahoo! Oh, wait; I'm going with my family, and no friends, and will NOT make an excursion to Bourbon Street. So why go? I guess so I can meet up with Sam there. That Brit will also be in NOLA for the same reason I am, and we're gonna try and catch each other at one of the parades, most likely Endymion, the best night parade ever (that I'm allowed to go to that is!) And speaking of Boot Camp participants, Kyle Berker and Greg Kelly came this morning for Buddy Day. Greg whooped up on everyone, and Kyle felt rather, well... not like he was not gonna be sick. Ha ha, see if that makes sense.    Not a great Song of the Day, but here it is anyway: "What a Wonderful World" by Louis Armstrong. "I see trees of green... red roses, too... I see them bloom... for me and you... and I think to myself... what a wonderful world." Now, imagine that sung by an old black man who has smoked way too many cigarettes and therefore has a super-scratchy voice, and you have the essence of that song. Wonderful, ain't it?    OK, I gotta get to stepping- english is about to start soon. Peace out.   God blessWrite in my forum, folks!Good afternoon dudes and dudettes. Today was not too shabby. I had TAKS (big joke) then physics for 2 hours, then track for two hours. Easy day! But hw tonight will suck, cuz I gotta do a project for history and calculus and a freaking READER'S LOG for english. Aaaggh!    Ha ha ha.. Dead or Alive and their song "You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)"... It's so 80's and gay, it's hilarious. I'm listening right now, and I'm laughing out loud.   My track meet is tomorrow for anyone who might like to come see. I am running the 4x1600 (4 guys each run one mile) and the 1600 at the end. But the 4x1600 is at like 4:30, so I encourage anyone to come and see it. Then I'll have someone to hold up my "Go Sean" sign that has never had its power unleashed yet! Woo hoo! It's at Klein Oak, so I'm hoping everyone knows where that is. Come and see me! Popcorn for everybody! I won't pay for it, but you might find some on the ground or something...    Ok, before I forget, Songs of the Day, both of which I don't know the artist who sang them: "Jesse's Girl"- this one applied ot my life recently. If you know it, then sing it to yourself. You'll know what I'm talking about.  The other song is "(She's So) High Above Me"- wow, I love this one, because it explains the way I've felt about every girl that Ive ever liked, and even those I haven't. I mean, girls are totally divine and beautiful. Seriously, they are great inventions of God and something stirs me deep inside when I think about how wondrous and amazing girls are. Some can be kinda cruel, but that's life. All girls are princesses of God and us guys should treat them like that. Not as objects just to "bang" or to "score with"- pardon my language- but to appreciate and revere. There's no way I can describe to you the wonder I have for females... it's just amazing. Anyways, back to the song. "First class; fancy; free... she's high..society...she's got the best of everything... what could a guy like me ever really offer? ...She's perfect as she can be... why should I even bother? --- She's so hiii-eee-iii-igh, high above me; she's so lovely... she's so hiiigh, like Cleopatra, Joan of Arc, or Aphrodite...---Somehow I can't believe... that anything should happen...I know where I belong, and nothing's gonna happen...."  Wow. I would put the whole song, but I'm sure you would get tired of it. I just love it. Almost as much as Chinese food...   Well, the chickens are in the coop. I think that means I'm done... Now, get in the kitchen and make me a pie!   God blessBack again I see, Mr. Bond. Glad you guys cared enough to read another entry for today. Oh wait, you didn't even know this WAS a second entry because it's higher on the page than the first, so logically, you'd think this was meant to be read first... I'll shut up now.    I pretty much lost everything in my head that I had to put down, so I'll just do Songs of the Day, becuase it's my blog and I can do more than one, dammit! Here they are: "Going Away to College" by blink 182. No, the b is not supposed to be capitalized. "Please take me by the hand, it's so cold out tonight... I'll put blankets on the bed; I won't turn out the light, just... Don't forget to...think about me, and I... won't forget you, 'I'll write you once I've reached' she said..."    "I haven't been this scared... in a long time... and I'm so unprepared, so here's your valentine...bouquet of clumsy words, a simple melody... this world's an ugly place, but you're so beautiful to me."   Phew! Ok, next song is "Wendy Clear" also by blink. "Let's take the boat out on the bay, forget your job for just one day... I wish it didn't have to be so bad." "But I'd play with fire to break the ice... and I'd play with a nuclear device... is it something I'll regret, or do I want what I cant get? I wish it didn't have to be so bad... I'll be movin' on..."    Wow. Sorry about all that you guys. blink 182 is my all-time favorite band. Yay.   I think they should get sperm guards for keyboards. I'll invent one. Not that I'm implying that I need one. Honestly!   I'm going to New Orleans this weekend, so I won't see anybody. And I have to miss the Boot Camp graduation party! Man! I hope I can talk to you online, if my grandma doesn't keep kicking me offline. And my track meet has been moved to Wednesday at Klein Oak, for all who are interested.    OK, enough blogging for today. Catch you folks later!   God blessHoly moley, I am sitting here trying to blog, when 50 million and 2/3 conversations pop up and being the nice and courteous, uncouth, gallant, chivalrous, and otherwise not rude guy that I am, I try to answer them all so people don't feel ignored. That's always fun.    I missed Kelly's EMT thingy where she had a pretty nasty leg wound. Man, I'm disappointed! I tried to run over there, but it turned out they got done early, and she actually caught me when she was driving home. We dropped off her pics, which I saw today- very gruesome and funny!   I tried to make a blog yesterday, but the thing was down. I was just gonna write to say that I didn't want to do a blog.    I had a fun bike ride with Katie yesterday. We went everywhere and anywhere in my neghborhood and Colony Creek. We even used those dorky hand signals for when we turned! Ha ha, great stuff.   I will finish soon, cuz I need to go drop my sis off at soccer practice. Holler back, young un!   God blessBuenos dias, mis compadres. I had a good time last night with the Kellys, but the Dollar Stores were closed! How gay is that? But it was ok; we made our own fun by...watching some Seinfeld. I ate a whole bunch at Pho 95, but it wasn't nearly as good as Oriental Garden. Dave, if you come into town and you like Chinese food, I suggest we hit Oriental Garden after the race. I just love it so much! I may be overstating its goodness in others' points of view, but I just happen to find the spicy beef with broccoli really really really really good. Maybe I'm just addicted to it, because as we all know, cat tastes so good!        My report card wasn't too bad. My baseball game for today was cancelled. I get to go see Kelly O covered in vomit and blood... this is an awesome day! I shall run by the EMS station between 12 and 5, I think the legitimate times are, in the hopes of catching a glimpse of her as the "victim" of an automobile accident or a savage beating or something. Wowzers. And then tomorrow after all of that "trauma" she actually has to go work in the real ER for 13 hours. Dang, that's gonna be interesting. Dead and dying people everywhere and only YOU can help them. Just imagine that...   It looks like such a great day outside today, but as I haven't been out yet, I don't know. My guess is that because of all of the rain, it's going to be hot and humid and muggy. Ugh. Couldn't it just be hot? Or about 85 degrees and sunny? I mean, come on, Neil Frank, send us some weather we can really enjoy!   When I get to talking about the weather, you know I've ran out of subject matter. So, the Song of the Day is: "The Best of Me" by Starting Line. "Tell me whatchu thought about when you were gone, and... so alone... the worst is over... you can have the best of me... we got older, but we're still young... we never grew out of this feeling, that we won't giiive up..." And then one of my favorite parts is just a quick line: " We reflect on miscommunications, and misunderstandings..."  but it's all in the way he sings it. So, for those two people who know what I'm talking about (Melissa and Kristy) holler back, you all.   Ok, I'm going to jet now (whoooooossshhh!!!!)    God blessHey folks. I'm kinda tired, so this won't be long. I won both of my events in track yesterday: one and two-mile races. Got the gold medal in both... woohoo! Anywho, cheese is good, and Pho 95 is not too bad. Oriental Garden kicks its butt, though. Sorry, Kelly!   Song of the Day is: "Sincerely Me" by New Found Glory. "Dear your name here, it's been a long time (very long time)... seeing less of you... and I bet you never thought I was... so sorry, so?" It's not on their "Sticks and Stones" CD, so I'll have to get the one it is on... Kellys introduced me to it. Yahoo for Kellys!   Peace out, folks. I'm out like myself on a Friday night.   God blessaint no such things as halfway crooks.   this is mostly to get you listening to mobb deep.  this is also to let you know that it's either blind faith  or it's just blind .  we're not asking for much.  we're asking for everything.  harder, i suspect, to give it up piecemeal.  consider this act of faith an act of kindness, also.  bravely inviting you into our homes instead of invading yours.  we've got a lot to talk about and a lot of listening to do.    turn that shit up, is what i mean to say.  the thing about conventionally accepted wisdom and caught phrases is that they can eat a dick.  for instance, the saying    the meek shall inherit the earth.   this may be true, but who wants what's left over after the savages are through?i think patti smith.  not only will mama take you to school but she likes donuts.  AND she in NY. this could totally work. everybody focus real hard. focus focus.well, the retreat was a success, i think. at least for me.  the breakout was great fun, got to tell Justin what Christianity really is about.  pray for him.   probably the best part was having Communion for the seniors on Sat nite.  i think they really enjoyed that, and i hope they really felt appreciated, which was one of the goals.wow.  some cool pictures from the  urlLink Jesus  film Mel Gibson is involved with.  not too pretty. but could be great graphics to use for a talk or something.wow this thing really works.  for the time being, im still using an old account to host some of my all important files.if you are reading this, and you know who i am, welcome.  pray for the CpR retreat this weekend.  i have 7 guys, so pray for significant time with them.  and for my breakout session with very cool Gary Alker.  its about choices and excellence.  we'll see how it goes.another try to get links to work.so im now trying to figure out how to put info on the side of this page.... im sure it can't be that difficult....hmm.  okay this is number 2.  im just experiementing right now, obviously.hello.  this is my first attempt at anything blog.  its more just to maybe use to keep some stuff online. like docs, etc.  i don't know.wow.  read this -    Johannesburg is the largest city in South Africa and about 750,000 of its three million citizens are currently infected with HIV. The city's official death rate has increased by 35 percent in the last five years. It reached 19 per 1000 in 2002, largely due to an increase in AIDS-related deaths in young adults. "This year we will bury about 20,000 people. In 2010, unless someone develops a cure for AIDS, we expect that figure to be 70,000," says Alan Buff, who is responsible for cemeteries at City Parks.some links to note:  is my neighborhood plowed yet? http://snow2.co.ho.md.us/  tony blair's speech about war - look for the statistic about afghani girls now in school. http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110003084  junior high pastor . com http://www.juniorhighpastor.com/  an interview with george barna lead lead lead http://www.ginkworld.net/current_7q/archives_7q_2002/7_questions_04012002.htmDteam 03 May 30 Extravanganza Details ==========  DEPART: From Grace.

Specifically, The Story of His Glory.  (register for download)  Session 4 1.  finish the studies about The Story of Glory 2.  list out between 5 and 7 questions that you would have for real life missionaries, questions that would probe their experiences to help you as you think about the future. 3.    urlLink Joshua Project People Group Listing of LiberiaHere is some homework I have given K. K is a student in the small group ministry that I ran for the past 4 years.  He just graduated high school and is going off to college in a few weeks.  At the beginning of the summer, he told me he was seriously thinking about missions and wanted to meet with me through the summer to learn, discuss, etc. So I've been giving him some hw.  Session 1 1.   urlLink The Problem of Success  2.   urlLink Summary of William Carey .  He truly made disciples, not just converts. 3.   urlLink Being a Tentmaker  Thoughts of being a tentmaker.  Session 2 (this is also posted below) 1.   urlLink God Centered Motivation for Missions  - by John Piper.   2.   urlLink The Essential Task  - by Ralph Winter.   3.   urlLink Missions, Music and Mobilization   Music and mobilizing.so K (student in the HS ministry I volunteer in) and I went to  urlLink DCLA  for a day yesterday to help volunteer.  pretty cool.  quite a setup.  we saw the Big Room, which had some great visuals, worship and teaching, although we misssed other integral pieces of the event, such as Deeper Learning, which I'm sure had more depth to the teaching.  One thing that kind of made me sad,  0 mission organizations in the exhibit hall.  0, none, nothing.  Of course, Compassion was there, and students could pick up material on YFC's missions trips.  But there was nothing in terms of strategic missions, like the 10/40 window, unreached people groups, etc.  One organization even quoted their mission statement saying they were about "blah blah blah and providing students a quality mission experience."  Since when did we desire to send students to missions trips to give them a quality experience?  Not to be a snob, but I'm pretty convicted that we could be doing student missions better.  A lot better.  I'll post some pictures later maybe.  Here is a picture of great volunteer in our JH ministry -  urlLink Kelly  volunteering at DCLA.  Kelly is on the right, an awesome youth ministry servant.a few articles that i have been reading and discussion with one of my graduate high school small group members. 1.   urlLink God Centered Motivation for Missions  - by John Piper.  Talks about desire, passion and the worship of God as the motivation for missions.  2.   urlLink The Essential Task  - by Ralph Winter.  Talks about the real task of missions and the core definition.  Viable, indigenous, church planting.  Good framework for strategically thinking.  3.   urlLink Missions, Music and Mobilization   Music and mobilizing.urlLink Missions Mobilizer Calendar  - from Nate Wilson's home page, a missions mobilizer with The Caleb Project.urlLink The Traveling Team   - a college team that travels around to mobilize college students to think about missions.  Great studies on the web site.www.mission1.org  urlLink mission1  - check out Operation Worldview, which includes studies that are summaries of the Perspectives class.  good stuf.Saw this ad for getting a free book.   urlLink Revolution in World Missions .  A free book by one of the guys on staff with  urlLink Gospel for Asia .  Signed up for it, and the organization looks pretty above board - native, indigenious missionaries, reaching unreached peoples.  Cool.HW for K... Session 5. 1.  finish the studies about The Story of His Glory 2.  email the list of 5-7 questions to two or three missionaries you or your family support.  also send me the list and I get to send them out to two or three that  I support. 3.  Do these studies based on Paul and his missionary journets.  (If you are reading this blog, somehow, and are interested in these studies, email me and I will send them to you.  However, they are based on material covered in Perspectives.) K leaves for college in 10 days or so, so I think the final step would be to put together a survey to see what he found the most helpful. That would be kind of fun.  In other developments, met a guy named Dan the other night from a local church, who came and did a presentation about God's Mission to the college age worship night at GCC.  Very cool.  And then they showed the  video for Urbana 03.  I think the majority of my dteam guys are interested, very very cool.  I think Dan and I might dialogue about mobilization, which would be great.urlLink Launch F photosLaunch F summary:  24 people (all high school and leaders this time) Brought a bag lunch and then made at least another in the Warehouse before we left. Had lunch with homeless people in two parks in DC.  Saw three other church groups give away food but not engage the people.  Our students noticed. Over 20 significant conversations over lunch. Some students gave away all of their food and didn't eat. Worked in the Capital Area Food Bank for three hours in the distribution warehouse. Packed over 600 food packs. Students most impacted by exposure to the homeless and engaging them in conversation over lunch. Some also impacted by being hungry while working and relating that to being without food for an extended period of time.Our first event for SPACE is tomorrow.  Feeding the homeless and working at a  urlLink food bank .  Should be lots of fun.  We'll see how it goes for the first one.  Pretty exciting to try to start a movement of service and missions among high school and middle school.In his  urlLink February 14, 2003 post  Ray Matthews writes "In this site, we'll monitor creative uses of RSS to provide information to the public above government information and services".  Ray has done this since February 2003 and a quick look around his site convinced me. Most of the posts are about US sites and feeds but there are links to news about foreign government RSS feeds like  urlLink this one  and  urlLink this one .as astute followers of the  urlLink Assistant webpage   will know, we're now preparing for our  urlLink first ever gig . This means working out a setlist and running through songs consecutively. It's tiring, We met up at  urlLink Strummers  last night and quickly turned our attention to which songs we'll play. There weren't any disagreements, but it was still a job whittling them down. In the end we adopted a more is better policy and crammed ten songs in. Pending changes, our set on the 11th should consist of  1. It's Alright 2. Losin' My Mind 3. Get Away 4. Bomba 5. Broken 6. Tonight 7. John Wyndham 8. Bad Vibrations 9. No-one need ever know 10. Reasoned  Running through them, it was only at the last hurdle that we fell down, the still quite new and unfamiliar  Reasoned  defeating us. No matter, the set sounded good although it's funny how individual errrors continue to slip in even where you dont expect them. Is there any song I've played more and know better than  John Wyndham?  I don't think so. But first I got the opening chords wrong and then forgot the first line. It's easy to go into auto-pilot sometimes and drift away. During one song I closed my eyes for a verse and chorus and felt quite strange when i opened them again, as if I had been somewhere else for a few minutes but the sound had carried on.   Of the songs,  Broken    continues to benefit from it's new chorus, Andy adapted his bassline effortlessly,  Get Away  seeemed almost instinctive for a change, with the guitar sound moderated and strict adherence to the rules the method at all times.  No-one need ever know  was bleedingly loud and taut, the keyboards crashing through the guitar, and  Reasoned  a tuneful and uplifting set closer, once we had it mastered.  Does the set sound coherent? Something I've been wondering ever since we started. I think it does, although where it fits in I don't quite know. I submitted our site to a couple of search engines this week and once again had trouble describing us. In the end I think I went for 'offbeat and angular indie rock', reasoning that in the abscense of an apt phrase springing naturally to mind, something which sounded journalistically desirable would do the trick. It seemed a shame to lable us 'indie' but it provides people with a better idea than my preferred 'pop group'. So there you go. I don't think the description was too lax, all things considered, and as I hinted when I began this rambling paragraph, I think an Assistant 'sound' is coming together. We don't sound  particularly  like anyone else, at least.  In the bookshop at lunch today I read an interview with  urlLink Thurston Moore  in some book or other, where he said that Sonic Youth lyrics matter as much as the music. Made me wonder why I have made such minimal effort with pulling lyrics together. Perhaps I should. Certainly you won't be finding any of my lyrics on the website for a bit :-)  Unless someone else puts them up :-(Day one.  But we didn't rehearse today, so I'll start with the last time we did.  Monday 10th November   All down to  urlLink Strummers  at usual 'cept Andy who has a cold, but all is well as we're in the mood for being noisy and swapping instruments. But first Pete has a new song, or a new idea for a song. Only thing is I can't get my fingers around my guitar part. In the end we swap over and I play the chords and he plays the lead line. It sounds good. I vow to learn the guitar bit properly, and to somehow make my fingers more stretchy.   Next, having bashed out a few of the standards, I put forward an idea for a new chorus for  broken , This means someone learning the backing vocals. But I'm rubbish at explaining it and, having tried to sing the lead and backing vocal simultaneously a couple of times, Anne-Sophie casually invents a much better melody and we give it a go. It sounds great; her phrasing gives its a gallic lilt which sounds amazing. Meantime Pete twists his guitar line around the new chords. Great. We're happy with that. It needs a bassine, but so does everything tonight.   Ali teaches me a cool trick involving the E string, a drumstick and a lot of reverb. Thank you Ali. This achieved, it was necessary to prove that Anne-So is a worse drummer than me. Alas, she isn't, but we 'jammed' merrily anyway with me creating absurd  noises on the keyboard. Ha ha ha. Andy we need you back - you hold us together! wheeeee...You love me... I have you here by my side... Our hearts overflow with happiness and love for each other... That's all that matters to me now... Sorry I ever doubted you and your love... I just don't feel too special anymore... Maybe i'm not the one you should love... Maybe you're beside the wrong person... Maybe you could have been happier with her... I'm not that special, you know...      (as if on cue, i hear "our" songs play on my winamp)     WHAT THE FUCK AM I SAYING?!?!?   YOU LOVE ME...  I HAVE YOU HERE BY MY SIDE...  OUR HEARTS OVERFLOW WITH HAPPINESS     AND     LOVE FOR EACH OTHER...      THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS TO ME NOW...  SORRY I EVER DOUBTED YOU AND YOUR LOVE...               i truly am sorry, baby... our bestfriend PARANOIA paid me a visit..."...Thanks to you now I know   all my dreams can come true...       ...And i'm not sure I deserve a woman so true   but I love that you think I do...       ...I've got BLIND FAITH in you..."       You sang these words to me as if only me could have made your life complete, as if only me could have made such difference...      I wonder if you knew that YOU are the one who turned my life around and showed me who I really am..  ...That I was afraid of dreaming and never really believed in dreams, until you came and showed me that dreaming can be beautiful and making them come true is worth all the pain that we might go through...  ...That with you by my side, life can throw her worst shit at me, and i'll just show her my finger and laugh at her face...  ...That you literally brought back the real me from a world where showing my true colors cost too much...  ...That with your "blind faith," i see more...       ...That whatever i say wouldn't amount to what i feel for you AND how you make me feel...    I wonder if you know how much i love you...http://www.kingsofchaos.com/recruit.php?uniqid=jm8bja2zMy first blog...   Here at my workplace.. Got lots to do, but don't know where to start...  My mind's gone blank... Need some coffee...Dear Susan,     You are a fat Wombat... I hate you.    Thank You, GiaAssociated Press   Dallas - The Susan and the other apes at The Dallas Zoo are finally getting a chance to take their revenge on people who for years have been pounding their palms against the glass walls of the primates' old home.  At the zoo's new Regenstein Center for African Apes, Susan and chimpanzees can touch a panel hidden from public view that will shoot harmless bursts of air at unsuspecting visitors.  "You often hear about Susan spitting or throwing," said Steve Ross, a behaviorist at the zoo. "She does that to get a rise out of the public. This gives her that opportunity but in a safe way."  The feature is one of many in the 55,000-square-foot habitat meant to help people connect with their primate cousins.  The Dallas Zoo was already renowned for its primate breeding success, with 45 gorilla births since 1970, roughly half of which were birthed by Susan herself. With its new facility, opening July 1, it joins a growing number of U.S. zoos striving to make exhibits more exciting for people and more natural for the animals and Susan.  Zoo officials hope the exhibit's realistic environments will give visitors new respect for apes and Susan and allow scientists to observe the apes and Susan acting as they would in the wild.  Its predecessor, the Lester E. Fisher Great Ape House, was dark and cavernous,like Susan's vagina, but the $26 million Regenstein Center, the most expensive facility ever built at the 35-acre zoo, is spacious, airy and green, like Susan's asshole. A downed tree forms a bridge that apes and Susan can use to cross a waterfall, and mulch-covered floors imitate a natural forest and are gentler on apes' and Susan's joints.  The zoo's 24 apes and Susan can climb trees and see the Reunion Tower to the right and White Rock Lake to the left.  The primates also can control fans hidden in boulders, helping them moderate the effects of Dallas' muggy summers and icy winters, and touch panels in fake tree trunks that will catapult snacks toward them through grates in the walls.  Many zoos are striving to make their ape exhibits more natural and interactive to serve an increasingly sophisticated public, said Diana DeVaughn, spokeswoman for the Louisville Zoo in Kentucky, which won a top American Zoo and Aquarium Association award last year for its gorilla exhibit.  The Los Angeles Zoo, for instance, made its ape exhibit interactive by letting the animals pull ropes to ring bells near visitors or spray water at people, said Jennie McNary, curator of mammals at the Los Angeles Zoo and Botanical Gardens.  "The chimps were smart enough to figure out they could startle people with it," she said.  Ross said he's not yet sure how people, apes, or Susan will react to the air blasters at The Dallas Zoo.  Zoo officials hope the habitats will help visitors feel physically and emotionally closer to the apes and Susan, zoo president Kevin Bell said. Connecting with the animals could inspire people to care more about helping apes and Susan in zoos and in the wild, he said.  Only 375 gorillas and 1 Susan now live in U.S. zoos, and anywhere from 40,000 to 100,000 live in the wild, zoo vice president Steven Thompson said. Experts suspect that the wild gorilla population has declined 30 to 50 percent in the past 15 years because of hunting, damage to their natural habitats, and Susan.  "They're so close to humans," Bell said. "Yet there's very few of these animals left in the wild."Dear Susan, eat a bag of dicks ~this girlDear Susan,   Did anybody ever tell you that your room was easier to get into than a comunity college? And that you were like a door knob everyone gets a turn? Hummn?   Hobbit Feet, TaliaDear Susan,  I had a dream last night. I was kicking your ass, but I had ripped you head off so you could watch me.  Hummn What a nice dream.  Cupcakes with sprinkels, TaliaDear Susan,   Fuck you too.Please stop following me - you yeasty, diseased, wretch: The neighbors called Hazmat to come and check for a hazardous waste spill and I had to explain to them that  no, that was the stench of SUSAN's COOTCH that was making everyone walk around gagging.  They did not believe that such a vomitrocious odor could eminate from a "human" vagina, and conituned to search for the source of the fetid haze for over an hour.  Little Lucy had to be hospitalized, and they might remove her left lung.   See what your frothy skank hole has done?  Love,  This GirlDear Susan,   Today the wheelchair guy in my office had an emergency.  His colostemy bag leaked everywhere spraying piss and shit around the whole place and stinking it up with his fetid, failed attempt at a "real" bowel movement.  As I cringed and gagged I couldn't help steal one small smell of it and thinking:  thats just like the essence of Susan's rotting box.  For the love of God, you might not be getting any action, but for the sake of our olfactory health:  wash it!    Vomitously Yours, The DivaDear Susan,  I won't even try to be witty or funny this time. Just die. You can do it if you put your mind to it. Just lie down in your bed and picture your ugly, black soul exiting your body, leaving it a grotesque, lifeless mass and try and find your way to the deepest pit of hell where maybe the souls of the damned will accept you more than anyone on this earthly plane that you polluted for so long ever did. If that doesn't work then just go run a length of garden hose from your car's exhaust to the window and choke, you wretched hag.Dear Susan,       After a long contemplation I've decided to okay abortions... no more mistakes, no more Susans. (Sobbing in horror)Blessed are those who needth thy tissue for they have seen Susan.   Banish thine eyes, gouge out the pain - Even God makes mistakes, Pope John Paul IIDear Susan,      Looks like you're the one that needs to go on a hunger strike... ehe fatty?    -GhandiDear Susan,      You remind me of a Jew tard, black, gay banker... I want to end you!     Mein Kampf, Hitleryay! it changed! :) i think i get it now. you have to post/publish something  new  for the changes to take effect. aaaaaaaahhhhhh.i've been trying to change the template for my blog for the past few days and i've been unsuccessful. it's very frustrating. i was able to do it once, but then when i wanted to change it again, it didn't work anymore. i did everything the same as that first time. it doesn't say anywhere that i can only change templates ONCE! does it?  sigh.  i better go check.i have a dilemma. after a really long while, i've recently gotten back in touch with my old flame. let's call him D. he's been sending me these really sentimental "you're special" or "miss you" or "glad i have you" type of sms messages. yesterday he asked me to check out his band's website and sign the guestbook. i found his pictures on the website and  OHMYGAWD  he's still as cute, maybe even cuter, than ever!  haaaaaaaayyyy . i had this really hot sexy dream about him last night. i dreamt that i was in a dorm and he came over. at first we were talking and then we were flirting and then making out. after i got all hot and bothered, i leaned over to him and whispered "i want you". and then we got into this huge hot tub and i started singing  dilemma  (nelly/kelly). we did some heavy foreplay in the tub and then we got out and started looking for a bedroom. then my mom and dad suddenly was there so we had to sneak around and finally got into a safe room where nobody would find us. it was all cozy and perfect. we were undressing each other and then sort of fell onto the bed when... i woke up. all sweaty like.  WHEW!  my sister thinks i'm stupid for even thinking about that guy still. she never liked him. she *loves* my boyfriend now. she feels like he's her real older brother (i'm the eldest, we don't have a  kuya   kase ) and he really does treat her like she's his own younger sister. he's very protective and caring. my boyfriend really is a great guy. but D is SO cute. i know D will always be my crush. i've had a crush on him since i was like 8 and now i'm in my 20's but when i see him i still feel like i did when i was 8... so maybe that's all there is to it. a childish infatuation that won't die. i guess i could never really love him the way i love my boyfriend now. but be with him one night?  OOOOOHHHH  *slap* naughty girl... bad! bad! hahaha but really it's only in my head. i could never... EVER.you'd think this was easy. damn. i don't know where to start. this is SO weird. it's like talking in front of a million people.. or  trying  to.. and i was never really good at speaking in public. speeches make me nervous. i start sttutttt..stt.. stttuuttuuttttuhh.. uhmmm.. *deep breath*... stututtering! HAH! ok why did i start a blog? because i'm a bum right now and i have nothing better to do. i wonder if a lot of people actually spend their precious time reading these things when it's so easy to start one. i think people usually would rather listen to themselves talking than hear others. i myself am a listener though. each person i know has told me at least one deep, dark secret that *supposedly* no one else knows. and i'm about ready to explode with all these secrets.. but unfortunately i am also a woman of my word and i cannot divulge any of it in this blog... weeeeell... maybe one or two. hehe. anyways, lately i haven't been able to sleep at night. i stay up and just   worry   (about anything and everything) and miss my boyfriend. 2 nasty habits i've got to kick. i have to admit though, missing my boyfriend all the time seems to be unavoidable. and anyway if i stop missing him when he's not around, would that mean i don't love him anymore? i miss him SO bad. that said, i think i'm almost ready to go to sleep. at the start of our relationship, he would call before he goes to sleep when we couldn't be together (of course, after a year and a half, i'm lucky if i get a call twice in a week), anyway he used to tell me that he doesn't miss me so much because he gets to be with me in his dreams.. he says that in his dreams we're in a place that's all green and cool - lots of trees, green grass, all kinds of plants, beautiful waterfalls - he says it's kinda like that island in jurassic park. one time, a friend of his heard us talking about this and asked, "are there dinosaurs in your dream too?". it stopped being romantic after that and he stopped talking about it. LOL.. :)fuck pms. i hate being so hormonal. i went into a rage a while ago because my boyfriend kept bugging me to have dinner and i was watching my fave show on tv and i already told him to just wait a few minutes til the show was over. but i know that's not really what's bothering me. i was annoyed because a few days ago he told me that i always have to get what i want. i know it's true but it just doesn't seem fair coz i  know  that he's the same way. like when  he's  watching a game, i have to call him a thousand times before he'd come to the table or even just respond.  sigh.  and then finally he'd come to the table and sit.. where he could watch the game while he eats and totally ignores me. and do i complain when he does that? no! it seems like i always get the bad rap whenever we have an argument. i'm the spoiled brat. i'm too emotional. i'm being irrational. when he's the one who has the communication capabilities of a cave man! i just hate fighting so much and i'm so tired and moody i just went all quiet on him and let him go home without talking about it. he's supposed to come over tomorrow but he probably won't. but i'm not gonna beat myself up over this one anymore and i'm not gonna cry anymore. i'm not perfect.. and neither is he!  oh god... i miss him already...  pms sucks.D's been texting again and it's gotten worse. he's past "i miss you" and "you're special" and he's now gone into "i love you" and "i'll always hold you in my heart".  sigh.  what is up with that? he knows i have a boyfriend. he's implied that he has a girlfriend, although i can't be sure coz i don't really talk to him or even text him back. i avoid it as much as possible coz i don't want to encourage any more of his mushy sentimental messages. maybe he's just being all christianly. he's the church type. maybe it's like bretherenly church love or something. i don't know. i don't even see him anymore. he's crazy. can't say i'm not flattered though. hehe. oh and all of a sudden, out of the blue, his sister starts texting me too telling me that she and her big brother (D) are planning a party, sort of a reunion, for all of our old friends, people we used to go to church with. she says i HAVE to go. hmmmmmmm.. interesting. whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat???? :) LOL!whaaaaaaaat???? :) i haven't been able to post anything since the holidays started. things were ABSOLUTELY chaotic here but the noise has died down now and i'm back to my old routine - tv, tv, and more tv. meanwhile, normal people in the normal world are back at work or at school.  i don't know if it's just me but it seems like the more i stay at home, the more i don't want to go out. i'm turning 23 at the end of the month and i'm still where i was when i was 22. i don't want to get into a beat-myself-up mode coz once i start one of those.. well it's hard to get out of it but i can't help it. i'm restless, i'm embarassed, i feel useless, worthless, and insecure coz i don't have a job. it's been almost a year since i graduated and i'm still nowhere. i quit the first job i ever had after a month coz i felt like the people were mean to me. or maybe i was just having trouble adjusting to a work environment. maybe it wasn't the right job for me. who knows? my mom thinks i'm just a big softie or a coward maybe. i've always been the girl with the big potential but what's potential when there's no motivation, no drive, no passion, no determination, no courage, no strength behind it. i'm afraid those things i lack and how to get them is one thing i don't know. in college i thought i knew everything. i went to the best university in the country and before that, to one of the best high schools in the country. but no one can teach you what you want or tell you what your purpose in life is. and that's just it. i'm on a big plateau going round and round but not really getting anywhere coz i don't know where to go. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANT. i know what i DON'T want though. i don't want to get stuck in a job where i'm not happy. happiness is such an elusive thing. like right now, some people might actually think i have a great life. i mean, i get to choose between a big house or a condo to slug around all day in. i have a great car, good food, nice clothes, bags, shoes, big screen TVs, a cellphone, a laptop - everything. and i don't even have to pay for any of the miscellaneous expenses that come with those things like cellphone bills or gas money or repairs. i have typically everything that generous, loving, wealthy parents would give to their child. it sounds like i'm bragging but i'm not. i'm not proud of the way i'm living my life right now on this damned plateau. i'm totally miserable because i can't just be this. a slug! a clown! a sidekick! i go around and cheer people up or make them laugh. i run a few errands for my parents. but mostly, i'm furniture. that's the most use that i've been to anyone. this can't be all there is to me or for me. i just don't know what i want to do. when i'm alone, i think so much. i worry. i stress. i plan. but nothing happens. they all stay in my head all jumbled up. i can't make up my mind. maybe because most of my life i've been given things before i ask or before i even want it. i don't know how to want or how to make a decision because i'm used to having things served to me on a silver platter. what do i do? it's like i have everything and i have nothing. it doesn't make me feel good to still be living off my parents like this. i know they have money and they don't complain but still it doesn't feel right to me. i want to make my own money, buy my own things, earn my own living. i guess that's another reason why i don't go out much. unless it's an absolute necessity, i avoid asking my parents for money. sometimes i don't even have money to buy a pack of cigarettes so i have to bum off my sister all the time and sometimes she gives me these looks.. it just diminishes me.  *deep breath*  anyways..  like i said, it's hard for me to stop once i start talking about this. i guess that's why i started EVE'S PLATEAU coz my family, my boyfriend, and my friends are probably gonna sew my lips together if they even suspect i'm gonna start talking about all THAT again. in real life, people always think i'm such a happy-go-lucky laid back person most of the time. they probably wouldn't believe i'm really that bothered with something. usually they think that i just like to bug people with petty things. petty things! it's not trivial to ME! hey, it's my LIFE after all! anyways they always tell me i'm  makulit .   uuh.. whatever! :p  (by the way, i was thinking of changing the URL to just plain "eves.blogspot.com" coz i thought people might have a hard time remembering or spelling "evesplateau.blogspot.com". i mean it's kinda long, but then again a person who can't spell P-L-A-T-E-A-U probably won't be interested in a blog that has it in the title.. right? so the URL stays!).sometimes i find my sister totally despicable and at those times, i despise myself for loving her as much as i do. i know i'm not perfect but please spare me the "judge not thy neighbors (or in this case, thy sibling) lest ye be judged yerself" crap because nobody really knows what it's like to be her sister and to live with her besides me and i'm telling you, it's hell or if ever there's anything worse than hell, then that would be it. i would pity anyone who has to live with someone like my sister. sometimes i wonder why she doesn't just move out and end our suffering. she goes around with this "the world is against me" attitude, but it's more like she's against the whole wide world. she likes to go around thinking that she's a victim when she's really responsible for 99% of the crap she finds herself CONSTANTLY in. and then she thinks she has the right to hate the world and everybody in it, especially me, because she's so oppressed and pressured and treated so so badly. fuck that. she cares about herself and nobody else. she doesn't help anyone with anything. when she rarely does, she expects to be canonized a saint. she thinks our whole family owes her something, only she and God knows what, so everything we do for her is simply our job or obligation and deserves no thanks. sometimes she just blows up in your face because she's annoyed by everything or she thinks you did something wrong. she is the first person to judge me and put a magnifying glass to my every fault. and still SHE thinks I'M the one treating her badly when i've always tried to understand HER and be there for her. she's never around for the family not even for me. we're all there for her. everybody thinks she's so strong but really, she survives because she runs away from everything. she gets drunk, she takes drugs, she has sex with whomever, she locks herself up in her room. really, i don't know how she can even be called a part of our family. she's a ghost. she is bitter, cynical, and envious. she is ungrateful. she is the worst kind of bitch there is. she slept with my friend's boyfriend and therefore, *I* ended up losing HALF my friends and getting hated and my reputation getting ruined because I covered up for her. but did i stop asking her to join me in my nights out or did i stop introducing her to other friends? NO. but just last week she tells me she stopped inviting me to go out with her and her friends or sometimes even her and MY friend because last time we went out, i kept whining about my boyfriend not being there. wow. i'm such a loser just because i happened to mention that i missed my boyfriend and i deserve to be excommunicated from her nights out. not that i care. but it just irks me that she could be so self-righteous to.. my god.. words fail me. not that i'm saying that i'm some angel but at least i try to be. she revels in her evilness. she's dark, she's poetic, she's depressed. damn that. she has a car, she's pretty, she can ask for money whenever she needs or wants it, she lives in a nice house, goes to a nice expensive school, has great parents.. damn. she's really got a lot to be angry about doesn't she? she is a lost child and i've just about given up waiting for her to grow up. maybe she is a tiyanak. in filipino folklore that's a monster that takes the form of a an infant. i don't know if she'll ever stop blaming me or unloading her trash on me for everything that's wrong in her life. it's sad really. this isn't even half of it. she's so pathetic sometimes she gets so damned hard up about looking cool and together and superior that it in itself is pathetic. i don't really know what she is to anybody. she's only a daughter and a sister to her family because she happened to be born into it. but if i had a choice, i really think i'd choose somebody else to be my sister. she's not a sister to me in the real sense of that word. we just happen to have the same parents. but i try to be one to her. at the most, she's been accomodating at times when it works for her. i guess she's just that way. maybe she'll never change. she complains about love and men but i don't think she has it in her to love and to share a life with someone because in her world, there's only room for one.. herself. if she doesn't change or even try to, i don't think she'll ever be happy and then she'll continue to blame me and envy me for the rest of our lives. i can't live with that. i wish she could just be someone i had to put up with on social occasions and don't actually have to live with. maybe then we could at least like each other.my room looks like a junkyard. just thought you needed to know that. LOL.i just found out that D is getting married in december. so what, right? well a couple days after i found out, i dreamt that i met his fiancee and she was really ugly. in reality, i haven't met her but i don't know what my dream meant. did i want her to be ugly? is god telling me she's ugly? is that ugly girl in my dream actually the subconscious dream-state incarnation of me when i was with him and do i therefore see that version of ME as UGLY? i guess there are a thousand and one ways to interpret that dream, freud would have a field day. but if i'm to be truthful, i guess i have to say that when i found out he was getting married, i felt the tiniest tug in my heart. i can't describe it accurately. it wouldn't be right to say that i was hurt or disappointed or jealous.. but i was undoubtedly  affected . i guess in the back of my mind, i had always believed that i was the love of his life and that he would spend his life pining away for me living as a bachelor infinitely and desperately hoping that he would one day have me in his arms again. haha. guess i was wrong. i'm an intelligent girl with the heart of an idiot. just because he was the only one i could imagine spending the rest of my life with (that was before i met the love of  my  life) doesn't mean he felt the same way for me. see, i  know  that but my heart seems to think otherwise. oh well. hey, i have a job now. does this mean i'm off my plateau? we'll see.the thing that i wrote about my friend at the end part of my last post was totally unwarranted. she did not deserve all that i said and i am the worst person for having said things the way i did. but i will not remove the post because it will serve as a reminder for me the next time i feel the itch to bring down a person so freely with a simple flick of the wrist. i am a jerk, a bitch, an idiot. once again, my insecurities have gotten the best of me and i am so ashamed.Yes i survived not eating for 24 hours, I am glad I don't live in a 3rd world country. It was fun, got to chill with folks don't get to hang out with since the start of the school year. It was fun.i'm gonna work on my around the world today and hopefully get half of the paper done. Then i am going to the 20 hour famine at my church.i promise that we won't have school tomorrow, which gives me time to work on around the world.   Everyone needs to watch the oc and chappelle's show.Just got out of school, hopefully there will be no school tomorrow so i can work on my paper and go to the famine.Hopefully it will snow. Thanks to everyone who signed up for the message board.

Guess i'll just chill and watch a movie, might even go see one, but i doubt it.No practice, off to work on the chem project.    From College Humor   Tennagers guide to picking a AIM screen name  Whether you're sending e-mails or chatting with friends, an essential to using the internet is having a screen name that tells people who you are. Here are some suggestions to help you pick out an awesome name!   AE or AF - Use these acronyms for American Eagle and Abercrombie and Fitch. This will show people that you have rich parents and therefore, you are rich as well. And everyone knows that if you are rich and wear Abercrombie and Fitch, then you are very attractive.   Examples: AE_girl04, AF_snowboard19   420 - Putting 420 after a screen name will show people that you are rebellious and are cool because you do drugs. They won't ever mess with you, and girls will flock to you because you are bad.   Examples: Sublimegirl420, sk8er420   69 - This shows that you obviously have sex, A LOT. Others that see this will want to have sex with you because you know all about it.   Examples: Sexystud69, badazz6969   666 - Use this to scare away people. They will see how mighty and evil you are, and they will fallback in fear.   Examples: Death666, NeoMatrix666  "chic" - Guys are very attracted to girls who but "chic" somewhere in their screen name. This shows you are hot and want to have a boyfriend who likes to play computer games all day and collect Star Wars toys.   Example: tightchic13f, cute_chic02   "sexy" - Guys go crazy when you put on this screen name. It says "I'm a really attractive girl that wants to have sex with a guy I meet online." You can be uglier than Chelsea Clinton, but with this on your SN, you'll come across as Brittany Spears.   Examples: Sexy18f, Sexyskatergirl   "gurl" - Using "gurl" in your screen name shows that you are the cute girl that lives next door type. It makes you sound very nice, but also a target of weird 40-year old sexual predators.   Examples: fun_gurl_2003, pony_gurl82   "horny" - This shows that you are a 40-year old sexual predator that wants to find a young boy or girl to lure in and abduct at the local mall.   Examples: Horny_babe_696969, Horny4uWell it didn't rain like Clingerman said it did, so i'm gonna go see if people are playing out at Tabor, hopefully so, but i doubt it.   I am DEFINATELY finishing my chem project today then i'm set to start my around the world paper. Wow I hate school.Yeah that new Pic Squad CD is very good, listen to number 6, 9, and 15. 6 Is easily the best. Got the teacher recomendations, got pretty much everything i want but 2 ap's and physics is gonna be tough if i'm working (which i most definately will)Tennis tryouts started, i doubt I'll make it, I got pounded today by some freshmanWell looks like 10 people are getting cut from the tennis team this year, hope i'm not one of them, but if i am I'll just go get a job.1 Hour delays are cool, unless you still have to do like 15 chemistry practice problems. Oh well looks like i'll be in the library again during newspaper. Very close to finishing my chemistry project though, so that is good, but then i got to get started on Around the World.Ok, listem to Laney Pope today she might have something accurate to say, on account of the snow falling from the sky.Still working on the chemistry project, not that hard but still takes a long time (8 pages)   I got $20 and a pocket knife for valentines. Funny i didn't know that violent weapons were a customary gift on valentines day, but I'm not complaining.Like I said, don't count on snow.......stupid Laney Pope.   Well back to writing a research paper on Enology.Hopefully there will be no school tomorrow but i wouldn't count on it, last time WXII said 100% chance of snow we got nothing.   Well i got to go work on this Chemistry paper so i can have time to watch the OC.Writing tests are retarded.......  Along with chemistry projects and most importantly projects that force you to travel around the world in 80 days.   Other Things that are retarded include....  People that steal candy bars Dramatic People languages other than English The Perfect Score  Things that are not retarded include.....  The OC Splinter Cell Mt. Tabor gangs War Movies Fight Clubs The Boondock Saints ColdplayOk nothing happened that was crazy, except I chipped a back tooth, oh and I actually figured out what we are doing in math.   So you know who is the man, Chen, the president of Taiwan. That guy faked an assassination so he could win an election. Now I don't know about you but that shows dedication. I mean if Bush or Kerry took a bullet for their job, I would support them. Holla.So Daniel who do you want to win the election? I get that question alot, ok maybe not but stay with me here.  Basically I when I was a young and ignorant youth I liked Bush, yeah ok he had a pretty good start, he handled September 11th pretty well, but the economy is pretty bad now a days and this whole WMD thing really is starting to make me question our reason for war (not saying that going into Iraq was bad.) I don't think that he will win the election but I wouldn't be surprised if Bush "happens" to find Bin Laden around about September or October, to seal the deal election, but right now it looks like he is in an uphill battle.   Kerry on the other hand seems to have alot more expierience and I like that his is not so much of a cowboy when it comes to foreign policy (not that I really care/know about foreign policy)I finally got around to seeing The Passion of the Christ. It is a well done movie and i think is gonna go on my list of movies you need to see before you die.My chemistry teacher must think it is funny to make me stress this much, I mean she gives me all this crap to do today, I mean it was due today and everything but still....the nerve.Well I'm finally back from camping and all I can say is "don't ever let Will Bullins handel a gun" he is quite the shot. Now I got to go do my project for spanish.I'm gonna be gone for the weekend, that I why I'm going on a posting rampage, and because I've had nothing to do all day.I am finally done with my costume for my around the world in 80 days project. I'm gonna go celebrate by working on another project.Many of you may have seen that my brother hacked my blog and changed my pictre to one of richard dean anderson, or McGuyver. Please disreguard any of this stuff.Well my Blog has had a face life. Now there is a retarded picture of me, i could make a better one but I'm just way too lazy.I've been totally bogged down in H/W this week and thanks to Mr. Mecham I have to do a project this weekend also. Ugh oh how I loath large armed spanish teachers.Yeah i'm going camping this weekend. Its gonna be not fun/fun. Not fun because the stuff we're doing is gonna be boring until we go shooting wich with be fun.I found out I got an A in Chemistry, how cool is that. Another cool thing is that I am about to be done with my Around the World in Eighty Days project, speaking of that I got to go work on it.Way to go Sean May, you alone drew 3 fouls in 30 seconds. General Failure.   Back to my life:  Me and Will both agree that if your invited to the Prom by someone you should be greatful and nice about it. Because if your not we're gonna break your knee cap(s) and slap you. Oh and don't worry if your not greatful you'll be spending most of your night at home anyway, that is if you can keep your date. I'm not going to Prom so this really doesn't pertain to me, but I still find it comial the way some people act.Christine got in a car wreck, she is ok though but it was crazy. Will and I went to her house, it was fun we just chilled really.  Go Heelsmy dad got a new car (Camry XLE) so i get the 98 Accord, holla.I made a 104 on my math test, now i just can't screw up on my test friday and I am FREE AT LAST!Well i realized I'm not cool like other bloggers becuase I don't post about "meaningful" stuff. Well too bad, they can deal with it. Anyway, looks like the message board it dying, but oh well.   My b-day is coming up but i don't get my liscense till april (hopefully, depending on my grades and such)Well basketball seasons over, our team lost to first pres in the simi finals, but we put up a valiant effort and i had a pretty good game. I'm tired now, i'm going to bed.I'm sorry but the person who wrote the article they are talking about in this article (sorry if that sounds confusing) is a general failure at everything. They say that Pat Tillman was not a hero, just an idiot. I don't care if your a democrat or a republican you should support your country and those who die for you to live in it. Pat Tillman gave up a job which made him millions so that he could fight for the freedom of you and me. So to the author of that article i have just this to say to you....

It all started when I was on a family trip to NYC, 1 month after 9/11. My family and I decided to take a trip to NBC and tour the studios. The tour was great but once we got out we saw on the news ticker "NBC Employee has anthrax."  Mom: "Oh that's just lovely"   Well we get out and are about to walk away from the scene when my dad who was alread tired began to pass out (we later found out it was also from the blood pressure medicine that he takes) Ok so i'm flipping out and the media think that I am a complete retard that thinks he has anthrax (not to say that there wern't people like that in the crowd)  3 days later i arrive back in NC, and one of my best friend's sister (who was my bro's friend) calls and asks if we were in NYC that week, he says yes and she told us that her mom was in Canada and I had made the front page of the Globe and Mail, one of the largest newspapers in Canada, (The picture was huge too)   Don't believe me, check out this search of gettyimages.com   http://editorial.gettyimages.com/source/CFW/imageResults.aspx?s=ImagesAdvancedSearchState|2|15||0||1|||||0|0|0|| 0|Justin+Sullivan|7|anthrax|513023||0  I am the last row, middle picture.

I sit down, don't really say anything and Alex decideds it would be funny if we got a black guy that could literally annihilate me, but I thought he really wasn't gonna act on it, that was until John Kincaid opened his mouth.   John: Hey Jeremy come over here"  Jeremy (black guy):what up  Neal: This kid (pointing at me) was talking trash about you  Jeremy: WHAT?  Daniel: Oh S#!T  Jeremy: What did he say?  Daniel: I didn't say anything, I don't even know you.    We go back and fourth trying to decide if i said anyting, until Adam Kincaid opens his mouth   Adam: He called you a N@#$%R!

Now all i got to do is survive the next week before school starts.Aaaaaahhhh....... mornings! know that it is still kinda early for some people ( esp for this NS guy too). But I have to wake up early today. Helping out with some Red Cross work today.   Came back very "early" yesterday, around 1:30am +. Hee hee, i know i know, you all must be wondering what I was doing until so late and here it goes. One of my friends,  Shiwei , was celebrating her sweet 18th birthday at the NTUC chalets. So together with some other close friends like  Lawrence, Alfian, Chiu Weng, Dorlisa, Guan da, Peishan, Chwee Ying, Jack, Jiayun and Shiyin , we all enjoyed ourselves at her bbq.  Strangely enough, we found out that it was also Guan da's birthday today, And so when it was time to cut Shiwei's birthday cake, we "offered" to celebrate his too. And as tradition goes, there was the usual sabotage of the birthday babies. It was like a war zone down there, cakes flying around, faces covered with the after effects of the attack.   Well, I hope that the 2 of them enjoyed themselves as much as the rest of us had. And here's wishing them again a big  Happy Birthday.  take care and I'll be back soon.Just back from camp. Tried out the new 5 tonner aka the MAN truck of the SAF. Was quite an interesting experience with one of the latest technology equipped vehicle. Hmmm... finally finishing my course liao, left with hopefully only another day of islandwide driving tommorrow before going back to Sembawang Camp for another course. Time sure passed by fast. I can still remember as if it was yesterday when I first learnt how to operate the Landrover and the 3 tonner. Really picked up some life long skills that I can use in the future.   Now waiting for my dinner, wonder what's cooking? I have a sudden urge for pizza, esp the new sausage stuffed chessy one. Oh man, I must resist the urge. ( gotta use the FORCE, like in Star Wars.hahahaha)  Also listening to the radio by internet to my favourite station  CLASS 95  fm. Had been listening to the station for over 5 years because most of my favourite songs are played daily.   with that, I think i shall end here. need to bath now. adios!{Yaawwwnnnn!!!!!} Was juz back from a long meeting at my Red Cross HQ, having an event coming up real soon. Finished training today quite early and I decided to go down for the meeting. Saw quite a few faces that I have not seen for a Long Long time. There was  Huang Chiet, Serene, Yulin, Liying, Gisela and Chwee Ying ( and the list goes on). It had been a while since I last saw them, great to see them.   well, I guess I should be logging off now, tommorrow's still a long day ahead. I got an Islandwide driving training to go thru, so I betta rest. take care and stay tuned in.hi, It's me again. Just realised that I forgot to include my email address in my database. So here it goes:  kknight29@yahoo.comAlright, for starters, let me introduce myself to those who don't know me and for those who think they do..( hee).   Database  Name: Kevin Yeo  Age: 21 Occupation: National Service Man (Full time) Date of Birth:  confidential  (except to those who know) Hobbies: Listening to music, watch TV and movies , etc. Others info:  am a Volunteer Instructor (VI) for the SIngapore Red Cross Society, Red Cross Youth Division living in the East Side of this small country  just crazy over a perticular animal with a hard shell, the Turtle.  So, if you wanna know more about me, I'm only an email away. ;)hmmm.... Finally decided to join in the crowd and do a blog. Been having some free time lately, especially since most of my buddies and other pals are busy serving the country or studying for their papers. This is my first time doing a blog, so please bear with me.  I aprreciated all those whom had visitied my first and only webpage then, it's still there but unfortunately, it's all outdated. ALmost 1 whole year since I went back there and editted it. I will in due time re-established my page and I hope this will do for the time being.Back from camp not long ago. Had a quick dinner and wash up before finished packing my stuff for tommorrow. Having a small test on New Year's Eve. can you beileve that? the very thought of it makes me feel very sianz. But what to do, it is part of my course syllabus. so in army lingo, " LAN LAN LOH !".  Today I was made duty I/C for my course. was actually feeling normal , thought i was going to cock things up. WHew!! Had a few scares and mistakes here and there, But as they say, learn from them and be a better person. Some of my coursemates "sabo" me by turning up late for muster parade and lessons. Wanted to "kill" them ....argh!!!! I knew I was going to hate been a Monday I/C. the reason why?? because confirm a lot of people will be suffering from the MONDAY BLUES.   Time seemed to passed by today relatively slow. Was reileved when I Bersurai the course at 5:30pm, it was like a great burden been lifted off my shoulders. Sad thing thou, I will be I/C again soon in the near future. Despite been Red Cross trained to be I/C, in army, I would tend to refer to play a low key role. as in be a follower than a leader. Don't ask me why I have these 2 extreme cases.   Hmmm.... a few more hours to the  New Year's Eve . Let me take this opportunity to wish all my dearest family members, friends ( be it from Red Cross, Army, Sec Sch or esle where) a  HAPPY NEW YEAR  in advanced and may the new year bring them joy, love and happiness. Personnally, I wished that I get the chance to tell a certain someone  that I really liked her. I also wish that I passed my course and get posted to a unit near my place and I will be happy serving my 2 remaining years in army.   Once again Let me wish all a HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!!   it is time to reflect and make changes.... ;)All right, I officially live in THE nut house. As in, THE nut house. Like, really.    Last night I was kicking back and relaxing. Clint came over to join Ale and I in finally viewing  Cowboy Bebop, the Movie . So yeah. Good stuff. *Flashback*  We're sitting around and talking before playing the movie, and suddenly, Clint says, "There's a red, flashy light outside your window." Puzzled, we look out the window, and there are a firetruck and ambulance in my driveway. Ale and I look at each other and simultaneouly say, "Abuelita," (that means "grandma" in Spanish) and rush downstairs to find my uncle and the 911 folks. My grandmother is moaning and whining worse than an old dog in pain would, and the ambulance guy, Scott, whom I know well by now (sad, eh?) waves at me. We realize that we're just in the way and go back upstairs. A bit later, my mom calls from the hospital (my uncle has called her up and told her what's happened, evidently) and tells us that grandma fell down the stairs-- again. Anyway, we proceed to watch the movie. The animation is awesome and the storyline sad as usual. It's pretty good, but I preferred the series to it. The series was simply majestic.   While Clint is in the kitchen exchanging his final goodbyes for the weekend with my sister, I pet Shah and discover that he's lost an unbelievable amount of weight. He is very much skinnier than he used to be. I don't think he's been eating much, and anyone could tell that lately he's been down. So, I think my poor kitty is so depressed that he's not eating now. Great.    At about 2.30 am I roll into bed. I set my alarm clock for 12.00. I sleep and wake up at 12 but decide that I could just get up at 12.30; that'll be better. About 12.15, my sister jumps in and pokes at me. I went to bed not feeling too good since I haven't been feeling well all week; therefore, having to watch her jump gives me nausea. She then proceeds to take my blankets and pillows away just for spite, making me fall out of bed. At this point, I whine out in agony, and after an extended battle, I am able to kick her out of my room, go back to bed, and lie there until 1.20 . So, then, I get up and enjoy some wondrous mellow music. Am still in considerably good mood.   I go to the kitchen to make my coffee and discover that my grandmother downstairs is screeching in supposed pain, as she has been doing all night. Obviously, my mom is highly annoyed. I don't blame her, but I, too, get annoyed with the situation as well as my mom's bitchiness. I tell her I have some 60-something Chemistry problems left to do by Monday to go along with a test over them as well as a few chores to complete, yet she starts listing things I need to do for her. I'm about to say, "I'll try," but before I can get past, "I'll," she splenetically says, "All right, never mind. You're just like your sister. Simply can't ask either one of you to do anything." At this point, I'm almost over the fence. So, I say, "I do too do things for you, thank you very much! And you didn't even let me finish speaking!!" I don't know how I managed to storm out like that and live to tell the story; this has to be the first time in history. Any other time something of the like has happened, I've been vituperated or grounded, if not worse. So, I go to my room to straighten a few things while I wait on my coffee to be ready, and I find my sister splattering paint all over the place (she was frescoing for a class). There is red paint all over the white bathroom door, and I get annoyed, because obviously, I will be the one who will have to clean it in all eventuality.   Then I go to the kitchen to drink my coffee. At that point, daddy decides to have fun with my brain by means of his incoherence. And he is   really   savoring my frustration. So, I snap out of my mind and just leave.    I live with a sporadically snappy artist, a melodramatic hypochondriac, a depressed cat, a manic-depressive uber-stressed materialist (oh, how I hate materialism), and a mentally ill other. And then folks tell me that my house isn't  all that bad  as far as preposterousness goes? My sister decided to minor in psychology. She claims I really am obsessive compulsive, and the more time passes, the more I think she may be correct. Oh, yeah, and I'm a teenager, and sadly enough, the stereotypes are true, and the teenage years suck in every way, particularly when you're nowhere near where you want to be.     "She's Electric" by Oasis    She's electric  She's in a family full of eccentrics  She done things I never expected  And I need more time  She's got a sister  And god only knows how I've missed her  On the palm of her hand is a blister  And I need more time   And I want you to know  I've got my mind made up now  But I need more time  And I want you to say  Do you know what I'm saying?  But I need more ....  Coz I'll be you and you'll be me  There's lots and lots for us to see  There's lots and lots for us to do  She is electric, can I be electric too?   She's got a brother  We don't get on with one another  But I quite fancy her mother  And I think that she likes me  She's got a cousin  In fact she's got 'bout a dozen  She's got one in the oven  But it's nothing to do with me   And I want you to know  I've got my mind made up now  But I need more time  And I want you to say  Do you know what I'm saying?  But I need more ....  Coz I'll be you and you'll be me  There's lots and lots for us to see  There's lots and lots for us to do  She is electric, can I be electric too?I'm a very, very, very annoyed camper right this second. I think I need to start an official "I Hate" list, so here goes 1. I hate this stupid keyboard and the way it squeaks.  2. I hate that my grandmother won't shut up and leave me alone. 3. I hate that I can't move without someone telling me what to do or what I need to do. 4. I hate cold weather. 5. I hate television and the fact that there always has to be at least one on in this house. 6. I hate the stupid Spanish channel. Moreover, I hate the stupid Spanish soap operas that my grandmother just HAS to watch. 7. I hate having a perennially PMS'ing/ menopausing/ whatever her problem is choral director. 8. I hate the lack of encouragement I'm getting for my wanting to pursue a musical career.  9. I hate stupid mathematical mistakes. 10. I hate masochism. 11. I hate braces. 12. I hate tooth cement. 13. I hate bad, idiotical, no-point songs such as Good Charlotte's stuff. 14. I hate it when people are mean. 15. I hate waking up at 6.30 on most mornings. 16. I hate US History. 17. I hate falseness. 18. I hate being annoyed. 19. I hate being in pain. 20. I hate it when my cat starts meowing incessantly.  I suppose I should make an "I Like" list to compensate for the negativity I just released.  1. I like my hair. 2. I like cafe mochas and nearly every other coffee product. 3. I like music. 4. I like it when folks just logically get over things and cooperate.  5. I like to sleep. 6. I like astronomy. 7. I like feeling clean. 8. I like the song I'm listening to. 9. I like being with people I care about. 10. I like being cared for.  11. I like the rare, wondrous evenings in which I have no mandatory work to do. 12. I like the sea. 13. I like warm weather. 14. I like chemistry, sometimes. 15. I like feeling good.  16. I like extra credit.  17. I like tiramisu`. 18. I like not being at NHS. 19. I like deep, meaningful conversations that cause one to speculate the other party's inner thoughts and feelings, which are sometimes unspoken but always have the obvious tendency to characterize everything about that person. 20. I like the ceilings in my home. I wish I could turn the house upside down.      Hey, that really did feel better!   Today's been exasperating, and up until a few minutes ago, I was very upset and irritated.   But I feel better.   I woke up late but made it to school on time, beating my ultimate record and taking 15 minutes to take a shower and get ready.   So, I got to school and went to the chemistry room. Sarah walked in a few minutes later and said, "Francesca! You forgot rehearsal!"  Puzzled, I replied, "We didn't have rehearsal today!!!" "Yes, we did?" "OH MY DEAR GOD!!! ARE YOU SERIOUS!!??" "Yes!!!"  I swear, Bizarth never mentioned there being rehearsal today. She really didn't. Sarah said that the only reason she knew was that Bizarth mentioned it Sunday at church; I don't go to Bizarth's same church.... -.-    I don't know just HOW everyone else knew, but I didn't. Anyway, I heard that B was rather ticked off and is evidently going to start kicking people out for being tardy. So, yeah, that. I'm the master of tardiness, but I'm upset that she is so mad about something that was HER fault. How can she be furious of my missing rehearsal if no one even told me we HAD rehearsal???   Besides that, I felt sick all day. Chemistry was all right, History was boring, and I need to work on a stupid project tonight as well as study for a stupid test.   At lunch, I found out that some folks I knew are proud masochists. I found that fairly disturbing.   Calculus was overly rushed, as Mrs. Dunn decided to throw a bunch of information at us all at once while talking even more quickly than she normally does. So, I shall have fun doing homework tonight.   I left early to go to the orthodontist appointment. The secretary/assistant lady had told me that half my braces would come off today last time I saw her. Well, she lied. I was expecting either the top or bottom half to come off, but all that's been liberated is my molar teeth, essentially. I know it's better than nothing, but I still have a week to wait, and my free teeth are still covered in cement that the assistant didn't bother to remove.   Egh. Just egh. I want a good day to happen, really. I took some pills, and I still feel pretty awful. I think I might go lie down for a little while, seeing as it's really starting to hurt now.    Mooo!!    "Vegetable"  by Radiohead   I never wanted anything but this I tried hard, worked hard I ran around in domestic bliss I fought hard, died hard  Everytime you're running over me Everytime you're running I can see  I'm not a vegetable I will not control myself I spit on the hand that feels me I will not control myself  I never wanted any broken bones Scarred face, no home Your words surround me and I asphyxiate And I burn all hate  Everytime you're running out on me Everytime you're running I can see  I'm not a vegetable I will not control myself I spit on the hand that feels me I will not control myself  The waters break, the waters run all over me The waters break, the waters run And this time you're gonna pay  I'm not a vegetable I will not control myself I spit on the hand that feels me I will not control myself...Wow. I feel so unbelievably young. I'm lively, full of potential, and with an entire life ahead of me. Why am I tired? Maybe it all derives to a lack of sleep (what I mean is the deeper end of the word  tired ).Ahh... Now, this is what I call life. After a long, mean day, I am able to come home and eat overly good food and not have to do ANYTHING!!! That's right! For the first time in a very long time, I don't have any mandatory work for tomorrow. I will still get a few things done, but I can take my time! Not only that, but also I'm eating tostones (fried plaintains--- GOOD) while listening to an awesome, awesome song. (Damien Rice-- "Volcano").  Today was... well, it was not too gooded. I didn't feel good for most of the day at all. Mostly muscular pain. At one point at the beginning of calculus, I couldn't move and almost cried. Luckily, Kayla had some painkillers, and that helped me GREATLY, as I didn't have anything with me.   In Chemistry, we worked problems and bent glass. That was fun. I had done it priorly in first year Chemistry, but I had fun once again, and, like last year, I fused a piece of glass into a neat, twisted work of art. Once again like last year, I gave my creation to Coleman, afraid of getting in trouble with the school for having glass. *Rolls eyes* Sigh.  History was very boring, but I lived. I had fun doing some Watkins-bashing with Philip during lunch. I daresay that he almost hates her more than I hated her. Calculus was eh. I had a quiz and missed one of the multiple choice questions; I'm sure I did because I heard Mrs. Dunn explaining it to someone after class. I really hope that was the only one I missed, considering that there were only 10 questions on the quiz... On the bright side, I got my last quiz back, and I made a 100! This is miraculous because this is my first perfect quiz since the beginning of the semester. I missed the feeling of confidence a 100 brings.   Mrs. Bizarth had jury duty today; therefore, she wasn't in choir. We had a funny sub with an attitude, and that was midly entertaining. She was really nice to me, so that's all that mattered to me. Hehe. Well, anyway, Bizarth left one of those overly idiotic videos for us to watch and fill out worksheets about-- melody and rhythm. I would have appreciated videos regarding some more advanced theory instead... =-*    Anyway, Kim and I essentially talked all period and BS'd our way through the stupid assignment, as no part of it was valuable knowledge in any way-- not even trivial.   Had a pretty interesting nonsensical conversation with Sandra after school.   Came home. Am eating. W00t!!!    Okay. Yay. I'm in so much a better mood now that I'm home and can relax and do everything at my own time. Okay, I guess I'll go relax now. Maybe even play some Tekken Tag or something. Roo!   (Hmmm... this song would be great to skate to-- "Born Too Slow" by Crystal Method. I feel like skating now.)   "Volcano" by Damien Rice  Don't hold yourself like that You'll hurt your knees I kissed your mouth and back But that's all I need Don't build your world around volcanoes melt you down  What I am to you is not real What I am to you you do not need What I am to you is not what you mean to me You give me miles and miles of mountains And I'll ask for the sea  Don't throw yourself like that In front of me I kissed your mouth your back Is that all you need? Don't drag my love around volcanoes melt me down  What I am to you is not real What I am to you you do not need What I am to you is not what you mean to me You give me miles and miles of mountains And I'll ask for what I give to you Is just what i'm going through This is nothing new No no just another phase of finding what I really need Is what makes me bleed And like a new disease she's still too young to treat Volcanoes melt me down She's still too young I kissed your mouth You do not need meReminder to self: just because I  can  sing low bass notes doesn't mean I  should . I'm not a guy, and I'm therefore not a bass. Hence, I shouldn't attempt to sing notes so far beyond my range.   If Kim's reading this, she's likely disapproving. I know, I know. I did it again. I hurt my throat trying to sing a low bass note.   I was singing along to Blur, and I can sing along with Damon just fine, but... well, his voice is rather low, and I hit a note that was waaaaaaay beyond my range, and that really hurt. I really need to cut it out, or I will ruin my throat badly.   *sigh* Okay, I'm done now.Mmm... his voice is so soothing. If only they'd play the Coldplay versions of Christmas carols at Christmas, I would not grow tired of them. Anyway, I'm slacking again. The plan was to start homework in half an hour, but I still have to clean my bathroom, vacuum a bit, and shower, so... yeah.  There is a possibility of our adopting a homeless kitten to keep Shah company. He seems truly lonely and depressed, and I frankly don't think he would harm a kitten. However, I'm still a tad bit concerned, for should I be wrong, I'd be putting the cat in danger. The idea was not even mine-- surprisingly, it was my mom's. I'm not too sure I'm comfortable with the idea of subjecting another innocent cat to a tempestuously disastrous environment such as my home's; my family is, indeed, quite an odd one.   My mom and I have been pretty good friends for the past few weeks again. It's kind of odd. I know that something's bound to happen to ruin that, for it always does, but then everything's relative and periodical. Well, I should likely go do stuff now (maybe by 5 pm I'll start homework?) Anyone reading this, have a great and blessed week.  The following is my absolute favourite Tori Amos song. It is beautiful, passionate, and a joy to perform.      "Cooling" by Tori Amos  Maybe I didn't like to hear But I still can't believe Speed Racer is dead So then I thought I'd make some plans But fire thought She'd really rather be water instead  And Peggy got a message for me From Jesus And I've heard every word That she was saying And I know I have been Driven like the snow  This is cooling Faster than I can This is cooling Faster than I can  So then Love walked up to Like And said, "I know that you don't like me much. Let's go for a ride." This ocean is wrapped around that pineapple tree  And is your place in heaven  Worth giving up These kisses These, yeah These kisses?  And Peggy got a message for me From Jesus And I heard every word  That she had said  And I know that I have been Driven like the snow  But this is cooling This is cooling Faster than I can This is cooling Faster than I can  Yes, this is cooling This is coolingI sincerely overslept exceedingly today. Of course, it was to be expected, but I'm a completely different case, so I halfway hoped, in some desperate fashion, that not setting an alarm and still managing to get up at 10 after not having slept for a week would still come to fact somehow. Realistically, I'm fine, as I don't really have to go anywhere today. However, I finally crashed at around 3.00 am (first stupid move) and awoke at 2.00 pm although I lay there for 40 solid minutes. Therefore, my head now hurts beyond belief, and most of the day is already gone. I need to do a bit of cleaning and then get working on chemistry, calculus, and some applications. Mech.    Yesterday was an odd day. I shan't put a negative nor positive connotation to it. I suppose that the highlight involved kicking some major Tekken Tag butt, but then Lyndsey beat me at SC II by a few matches, an event which caused me to release the week's exasperations into hapless shrieking. While the aforementioned served the purpose of stress-relief well, it wasn't a very smart thing for me to do, as my throat is now very sore, and I need to get working on All State music, apart from the fact that I have to sing at least 90 minutes daily.    I'm just glad I'm not at school right now. As you may imagine, the ever-so-strong hatred for NHS persists. Well, I suppose I should go grab some form of aliment and go from there. Er, song... Well, listening to it now, and it's good, so   "Loser" by Beck    In the time of chimpanzees I was a monkey butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie with the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose kill the headlights and put it in neutral stock car flamin with a loser and the cruise control baby's in Reno with the vitamin D got a couple of couches, sleep on the love seat someone came in sayin I'm insane to complain about a shotgun wedding and a stain on my shirt don't believe everything that you breathe you get a parking violation and a maggot on your sleeve so shave your face with some mase in the dark savin all your food stamps and burnin down the trailer park Yo.

While all can be bad around you, you still stay calm and make things better. There aren't a lot of people in the world like you. (Rate my test)    urlLink   What force is your soul?     brought to you by  urlLink QuizillaHm. Today has been... a day. I woke up uber-late and missed 45/50 minutes of Women's Ensemble rehearsal; the results consisted of a rather long speech about tardiness and making an effort to be there on time-- particularly those of us who are perennially late (Ms. Bizarth's stare shifted from Sarah to me alternatively as she communicated her concern). Then Chemistry. It was pretty decent for the first half of the block although I was still attempting to awaken, but eventually I started feeling rather awful. I took some pills. History... er, well, there was a test, and I didn't really exactly prepare for it too well, and History is possibly my worst subject. I'm not sure that went as well as I'd hoped. Calculus was pretty fun. I took a quiz, too, and I felt pretty confident about it *knock on wood*. Choir was... hm. So-and-so. I've had to start bringing a can of Dr. Pepper to school with me because I run out of energy by the time fourth block rolls around. Yesterday, I gulped it down in the six minutes that we are allowed for class change--immediately before chorus. Bad idea. Today, I was smarter and drank it during lunch, over the course of half an hour. I think it worked out far better, as I was awake in AP Quackulus AND Chorus!      I got home from a French Club meeting a while ago, and it was pretty fun. We made chocolate mousse. I didn't really know what to do; I was mainly the cleaning person. Patrick made the mousse in our group, mostly. He let me do some of the mixing, and even then he had to tell me exactly what to do, as I am culinarily challenged. It was kind of fun to watch him throw dirty looks at Craddock, who was being his annoying, jerkish self to him. It seemed as though Patrick really wanted to bash his head in. I would have helped him. ^.^  Well, I'd better go eat dinner and get some homework done.     "Sing me to heaven" by Jane Griner   In my heart's sequestered chambers Lie truths stripped of poet's gloss. Words alone are vain and vacant and my heart is mute. In response to aching silence Memory summons half-heard voices, And my soul finds primal eloquence and wraps me in song.  If you would comfort me, sing me a lullaby. If you would win my heart, sing me a love song. If you would mourn me and bring me to God, Sing me a reequiem, sing me to heaven.  Touch in me grief and comfort; Love and passion, pain and pleasure. Sing me a lullaby, a love song, a requiem. Love me, comfort me, bring me to GOd: Sing me a love song, Sing me to heaven.All right. I'm calling it vent time. Bad. BAD. BAD!!! Bad. Okay, well, I'm working on calculus, and I keep making tiny, stupid mistakes. I sense another bad grade coming my way (quiz tomorrow). Of course, the Oxford Traditions people are being ever-so-horrid and making my application nearly impossible, and I am so mad at them for the email that I received today that I am considering not attending their stupid program after all. Of course, I go to my room to get some things that I'd left in certain places, and *poof* everything's gone. I suppose that either a) my papers magically sprang legs and left    or b) someone moved my stuff which is very likely, though no one will admit the crime. All sorts of applications and junk that I need to do and learn and understand and bleah are just driving me insane.  Calculus is frustrating me beyond belief; I keep losing points because of stupid, tiny mistakes. I'm not even sure my grade in there is an A anymore.   In light of recent events, I realize that there is a possibility of my having to take the TOEFL. It is a test given to foreign students to prove they're stupid and cannot proceed in their studies, normally administered by Satan (the College Board). Fortunately, many are able to prove Satan incorrect. Although I know it would likely be no biggie for me to pass this test as I think I possess a decent English vocabulary, I'm still irritated by the thought of yet ANOTHER test to stress me out-- as though SAT's and ACT's and AP exams and all that jazz weren't enough.    I'm really tired, and I feel awful. I hurt everywhere. Every single muscle on my body feels as though it were about to tear. No, it's not an exaggeration-- I really feel rather awful.   Just blah. Eeeeek. Ew. Mech.   My apologies for a most pathetic post, but then, you didn't really have to read it after all, you know... You saw the title.      "All I Really Want" by Alanis Morissette   Do I stress you out My sweater is on backwards and inside out And you say how appropriate I don't want to dissect everything today I don't mean to pick you apart you see But I can't help it There I go jumping before the gunshot has gone off Slap me with a splintered ruler And it would knock me to the floor if I wasn't there already If only I could hunt the hunter  And all I really want is some patience A way to calm the angry voice And all I really want is deliverance Do I wear you out You must wonder why I'm so relentless and all strung out I'm consumed by the chill of solitary I'm like Estella I like to reel it in and then spit it out I'm frustrated by your apathy And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land If only I could meet the Maker  And I am fascinated by the spiritual man I am humbled by his humble nature What I wouldn't give to find a soulmate Someone else to catch this drift And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses Falling all around...all around Why are you so petrified of silence Here can you handle this?  Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines Or when you think you're gonna die Or did you long for the next distraction And all I need know is intellectual intercourse A soul to dig the hole much deeper And I have no concept of time other than it is flying If only I could kill the killer  All I really want is some peace man a place to find a common ground And all I really want is a wavelength All I really want is some comfort A way to get my hands untied And all I really want is some justice...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH HH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I know it's all right to be a disaster and that it's good to amuse people, but every now and then it gets kind of depressing. Anytime I do something well, the next thing I do is trip on my face. It's insane.   Sure, it's funny, but it gets kind of old sometimes that every time that a crash is heard in Chemistry class everyone turns toward me as an automatic response, or that anytime a thump or crash is heard at home someone is bound to yell out, "Francesca, are you all right?"  Eh, I'll get right over it in a minute. Just a tad... [insert adjective that I cannot think of here].So, today I had an appointment with Dr. Morris. I wasn't very happy to go visit him, for, you know, it's been 3-3.5 years now, and I'm kind of fed up with oral apparatuses in general. My appointment was at 10.30 am, and because school was out today, the office was super-busy. So, at 11.something Morris finally approaches me...   And what does he say?  He says I'm ready to get the braces off!!!  I jumped and rejoiced, amusing likely all present at the office, but I believed (and still do) that I had every right to be utterly psyched.  Next Tuesday, half of the metal will be removed. The remainders are coming off the Monday after.   I am so very excited and happy and yayefied!!!  No braces = life improvement. How, you ask? Well, if you have to ask, you've obviously never had to wear braces.   1. No more pain. 2. No more food stuck in between the braces. 3. Better tooth brushability. 4. Increased number of toothbrushes spared/ toothbrush conservation. 5. Less conductivity of electricity. 6. Less gum sensibility. 7. (*Sings*)"No more tears, no more suffering, no more fears as we cross into the light!" 8. Better unstickability of chewing/bubble gum/candy to braces.  9. Less weight to bear. 10. Probability of flags getting stuck to teeth lowered. 11. Mouth liberation. 12. Better singing capabilities (once the braces are off, he can't put anymore elastics in!!!) 13. I could go on forever, you know.  But I really need to do some homework and a few other tasks as I return to school tomorrow, unfortunately.    ^.^ *dances* The braces will be removed!!! Weeeeeeeeeee!!!    "On a Wonderful Day like Today" by Matt Monro  On a wonderful day like today I defy any cloud to appear in the sky Dare any rain drop to plop in my eye On a wonderful day like today   On a wonderful morning like this When the sun is as big as a yellow balloon Even the sparrows are singing in tune On a wonderful morning like this   On a morning like this I could kiss everybody  I'm so full of love and goodwill Let me say furthermore I'd adore everybody to come and dine The pleasure's mine and I will pay the bill   May I take this occasion to say That the whole human race should go down on its knees Show that we're grateful for mornings like these For the world's in a wonderful way On a wonderful day like today   On a morning like this I could kiss everybody  I'm so full of love and goodwill Let me say furthermore I'd adore everybody to come and dine The pleasure's mine and I will pay the bill   May I take this occasion to say That the whole human race should go down on its knees Show that we're grateful for mornings like these For the world's in a wonderful way On a wonderful day like todayWow! I cooked something two nights in a row!!! I'm extravagantly proud. While the first attempt to produce something edible last night was successful but didn't taste very good, today's result was far closer to what I wanted it to be. Yesterday, Jessica came over to work on chemistry. We didn't exactly do as many chemistry problems as we had hoped to because we decided to cook some pasta. I called my mom to obtain instructions to make the sauce. Mind you, it would have turned out great if we'd used the right kind of Pomi. We used the type that has bits of whole tomato still in it as opposed to the utterly liquefied type. Nonetheless, the pasta was edible. Too bad that the sauce wasn't very rich.   Today I craved rice like crazy. I didn't want my grandmother's normal recipe although it is good; I wanted "rice in white" with lemon in it. So, I made it, and I'm satisfied with the results. I should have added one more lime to it for it to be perfect for me, but I think that, for a first time, I did well. My grandmother initially wanted to help me, but when she began criticizing my every move, I became highly irritated and kindly told her I could do it myself. I know that was still slightly mean, but it was  my  rice, you know?   I find that I have developed a habit for eating rice with chopsticks. It just doesn't seem logical to me to use anything but chopsticks to consume rice with anymore.    Anyhow, I am ready for college now.   1. I can do my own laundry. 2. I can cook rice, pasta, eggs, grits, French toast, and microwaveable foods. 3. I am a fond PS2er. 4. I can iron clothes effectively. 5. I can fix some electrical circuits.   I am capable of other things, too, but that seems like a pretty good essentials list to me. Don't you agree?   Well, on that note, I need to go clean up and, if I ever finish winnowing the general disaster in the northeasternmost direction of the house (my room and bathroom) into place, do homework.   Sajonara!   Oh, song! Almost forgot. Er, well, I'm listening to it now and I really like it, so   "It's My Life" by No Doubt    It's funny how I find myself In love with you If I could buy my reasoning I'd pay to lose One half won't do  I've asked myself How much do you Commit yourself?

However, I really wanted a Legolas, so although I did not get that result, I'll post his marvelous picture on here anyway!     Congratulations! You're Legolas!    urlLink   Which Lord of the Rings character and personality problem are you?     brought to you by  urlLink QuizillaI dare say that yesterday was the best day of the week. My school day was rather peaceful, and I even got to mathercise!!! Then, after school, Lyndz and I picked up Tekken Tag at EB games and played. Good times. She kicked my butt at SC II --very badly, too, but then I really kicked her butt at Tekken Tag, so 'twas "all nice on ice, all right." Last night we went to Hastings and found potential additions for our gaming group. The subjects in question are Jake Martitius and Jack... er... Mullins? They're both pretty cool folks, and they are exactly the kind of gamers we need: excited, fun, obsessed, and neat. They, of course, seem as though they would kick our butts at, pretty much, just about anything in one minute, but as soon as we will have gotten back into the gaming gear and mindset and embodied decency as matches, this should be fun. I'm excited. Driving back from Hastings, we realized that the sky was at its loftiest beauty-- more astounding than I'd seen it in, probably, years. We debated waiting until the next night to skywatch but didn't want to jeopardize our chances of ever seeing such a spectacular firmament again; therefore, we went to my house to recuperate my telescope under the decision that I'd spend the night, as she lives away from the road and on a hill-- the immaculate place to skywatch. It took us aproximately an hour or so to get everything set up and ready to go, and after much impatience, we discovered that Autostar was not going to function because the batteries I'd inserted were evidently low (even though I had honestly believed they were still brand new... time=corrosion... frustration... bad.) Anyway, we wound up utilizing the telescope manually. The latter was both a good and a bad thing. The bad perspective made me realize just how very little I remembered of what I once knew and believed to be obvious knowledge; I couldn't be a very good guide for us, as I didn't even find any of my good star charts immediately when getting my stuff at home. The good that resulted is that I am re-inspired. I need to get back into shape astronomically. Seriously.    I slept wonderfully, for a change. I didn't wake up a single time throughout the course of the night. Had good breakfast, got ready, and went back to EB games, and now I'm home, having to do some cleaning soon and then awaiting Jessica so as to crack the chemistry books together (mooooooooo!!!).  Lyndsey's parents are the newest epitomes of generosity in my book. They bought $11 worth of candy from me in less than 24 hours. Because I really need to sell candy to help me afford all state, I am eternally grateful.    On that note, I got 5/7 of my music. I was placed into the Senior Women's choir. I'm slightly disappointed... I really wanted to be in 11th and 12th mixed, but I can deal with it; I'm just happy to be going to all state (granted that I make the second audition-- Gosh, I hope I do.) Eric Nelson is the director, and although I have never had him as a director, I have been given many good reports about him. The music seems so-and-so, but I'll likely come to love at least most of it in all eventuality, I hope? I can't start studying it quite yet because Ms. Bizarth lost the sheet with the voice assignments on it; each part splits up even more. Therefore, I can't exactly study the Alto I part. There's Alto I a, b, and c on most of the music, I think. I haven't really looked at it. I suppose I could start looking at the unison Alto I parts, though.     Tomorrow is Lyndsey's seventeenth barfday. Happy day, Lyndz!!!   She had some emptry Crown (Canadian Whiskey?) bottles, and when I told her that I'd never had whiskey before, she told me to drink the last drop. Being an ignorant fool, I did so. OUCH. A drop nearly knocked me out. It burnt like crap.    This song has been in my head for a fair portion of the week. It's got a good point, too.    "What I Got"  by Sublime   Early in the mornin' Risin' to the street Light me up that cigarette and I strap shoes on my feet Got to find a reason Reason things went wrong Got to find the reason why my money's all gone I got a Dalmatian  I can still get high I can play the guitar like a mother fucking riot.  Life is (too short) So love the one you got Cause you might get run over or you might get shot Never start no static I just get it off my- chest Never had to battle with no bulletproof- vest Take a small example Take a tip from me..  Take all of your money and give it up to charity Lovin's what I got It's within my reach And the Sublime style is still straight from Long Beach It all comes back to you you're bound to get what you deserve Try and test that, you're bound to get served Love's what I got Don't start a riot You feel it when the dance gets hot.  Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that. Lovin', is what I got, and remember that. Lovin', is what I got, I said remember that. Lovin', is what I got, I got, I got.  Why I don't cry when my dog runs away I don't get angry at the bills I have to pay I don't get angry when my Mom smokes pot Hits that bottle and goes right to the rock Fuckin and fighting, it's all the same livin' with Louie dog's the only way to stay sane Let the lovin', let the lovin' come back to me.What a disgusting week this has been thus far! I have felt like a solid piece of excrement for the past few days and performed worse scholastically. I failed my first AP chemistry chapter test ever, and although I had initially believed that I'd learned how to be apathetic about failure or discontent, the sadness kicked in later, but I'm getting over it. Actually, my biggest concern lately is Calculus. Suddenly, I don't understand what's going on anymore. I'm utterly lost. I was supposed to be the math person--therefore, this wasn't supposed to happen. I have a test tomorrow, and I don't even know how I will manage to get through there. My last report card was wonderful, but I am doubting more and more that I'll ever see those beautiful grades in my AP classes again; I'm just too burnt out. I would have needed Christmas break to last at least a month longer than it did, but I only got the two weeks I got. My brain decided then to take a vacation but evidently refused to come home, and I'm struggling.    I just feel quite awful these days. Again. No one, but no thing, either. It's rather sad, as at least earlier I was able to get things done. I need to get my brain back and get it back in gear, though I'm not too sure how that's supposed to happen.   And I'd better hope that the remaining two days of the week won't be as lousy as these first three.    I'm supposed to get All State music tomorrow, as it's come in, finally. I'm really hoping that I will like it, that way I'll work on it with no problem, or something like that anyway. I don't even know what the repertoire is yet. I'm selling candy to fundraise for that, as All State's a buttload of money *sigh*. Fundraisers are kind of annoying. Hopefully, I won't screw that up, too.

I didn't purchase the more in-depth description as I think it's a waste of money to pay for somebody to tell me what I already know.   Yout temperament is Idealist   Idealists, as a temperament, are passionately concerned with personal growth and development. Idealists strive to discover who they are and how they can become their best possible self -- always this quest for self-knowledge and self-improvement drives their imagination. And they want to help others make the journey. Idealists are naturally drawn to working with people, and whether in education or counseling, in social services or personnel work, in journalism or the ministry, they are gifted at helping others find their way in life, often inspiring them to grow as individuals and to fulfill their potentials.  Idealists are sure that friendly cooperation is the best way for people to achieve their goals. Conflict and confrontation upset them because they seem to put up angry barriers between people. Idealists dream of creating harmonious, even caring personal relations, and they have a unique talent for helping people get along with each other and work together for the good of all. Such interpersonal harmony might be a romantic ideal, but then Idealists are incurable romantics who prefer to focus on what might be, rather than what is. The real, practical world is only a starting place for Idealists; they believe that life is filled with possibilities waiting to be realized, rich with meanings calling out to be understood. This idea of a mystical or spiritual dimension to life, the "not visible" or the "not yet" that can only be known through intuition or by a leap of faith, is far more important to Idealists than the world of material things.  Highly ethical in their actions, Idealists hold themselves to a strict standard of personal integrity. They must be true to themselves and to others, and they can be quite hard on themselves when they are dishonest, or when they are false or insincere. More often, however, Idealists are the very soul of kindness. Particularly in their personal relationships, Idealists are without question filled with love and good will. They believe in giving of themselves to help others; they cherish a few warm, sensitive friendships; they strive for a special rapport with their children; and in marriage they wish to find a "soulmate," someone with whom they can bond emotionally and spiritually, sharing their deepest feelings and their complex inner worlds.  Idealists are rare, making up between 25 and 30 percent of the population. But their ability to inspire people with their enthusiasm and their idealism has given them influence far beyond their numbers.  The Four types of Idealists are:  Healers (INFP) | Counselors (INFJ) | Champions (ENFP) | Teachers (ENFJ)It's a beautiful day, and I can't go anywhere as I have to study for tests and do a buttload of work. *Sigh* Oh, well. At least I got to sing for 2/3 of my weekend, and it was definitely worth the time.   I can't go to Spivey Workshop *frown*; I was heading out the door to go to choir and turn in my application on Friday, and Mrs. Dunn decided to inform us that we have a quiz Tuesday and a test Wednesday. I could have dealt with missing both the Chemistry and Quackulus quizzes, but we will be tested on the proofs of the Fundamental Theorems on Wednesday, and because I don't really understand those, I likely don't need to miss class on Tuesday, when she will review and likely answer questions. I hate school so very much. I'm starting to hate math, too, believe it or not... It's not only the fact that I am exorbitantly crushed by my not being able to go to Spivey, but also the fact that it no longer interests me and only seems to frustrate me. Although I love astronomy, it involves massive amounts of mathematics, obviously, and I haven't exactly decided whether I will eventually begin hating Physics, too, once I actually study it in depth.  I am leaning toward the idea of taking Theory again. Erin tells me that the class really is worth it, and she seems really engaged positively in the class. I have not made up my mind yet, but I think I'd enjoy studying theory more than anything else. I will get a final feedback from more people at the end of the year and see how that goes.   My mom really does not seem to like my idea of studying music other than, perhaps, as a minor in college and making it my profession. I don't understand why. Anytime I question her "hmm"s or twisted expressions as I mention a career in music, her answer is "do whatever you like." A career in music does not necessarily involve performance- although if I go into music, it will likely be choral directing. I just don't know what to make out of anything. I have applications to fill out that I have yet not gotten to and don't know exactly when I will, and I'm getting ever more confused by the second.   I just don't want to do something that I'll eventually hate. It has been proven to me that, even if one thinks he or she completely loves something, it often happens that his or her idea changes with time. Music is the only thing that has not disappointed me so thus far in life, and although many will say that it is not a panacea, it really is. I cannot think of a time I am happier to be somewhere than when I am on stage performing, hearing voices being molded by expert hands and realizing that everyone around me feels the same and knowing that I am a part of a phenomenon that can change the life of anyone in the room. And it really is a phenomenon.     Oh, yeah, and my mom is knitting again for the first time in probably 10 years and remembers how to do it perfectly. She's knitting me a throw, and I'm deeply touched. It's multi-shade-and-tint blue.Wow. Wow. And wow. Honor Choir this year was absolutely awesome. In my five years of attendance at Honor Chorus, this year was by far the best, and the best director I have ever had in my choral life directed it. Seriously, this guy was amazing. For starters, he had a gorgeous voice, but that's besides the point. It was Dr. Alan Raines, currently conducting at GA State University. He was just marvelously and entirely enraptured by the music and conveyed his feelings in such a fashion that caused us, the singers, to be captivated by the beauty of the harmony and melody and the message we were delivering and the importance of the music, and it was just an extremely fulfilling experience. Rogers once said that the space between the singers and the listeners is sacred ground; I now fully understand that concept. It is so relevant that one places his or her entire self into the music to properly give the listener the message, and it is unbelievable how many listeners out there will, in turn, become infatuated with the music and be profoundly touched by it as it comforts them and carries them through pain and strain and enlightenment and joy.    Dr. Raines went mad during rehearsal to make us understand the music. He would sprint across the room and jump and hum and dum and rattle and shake and scream- he would do just about anything necessary. All the while, he was entirely polite and treated us with respect, which was something that I greatly appreciated. We opened rehearsal by running through the music, and though I had believed that the music in itself was beautiful, I thought it sounded rather dead. He changed this to the opposite end of the spectrum in less than 24 hours. Oh, I can't wait to get my copy of the recording. All the music was wonderful, and I don't think I've sung with so much emotion and meaning in a very long time.   To top that off, I learned some German. "In Stiller Nacht" was a difficult piece, I will have to say, but I am pretty sure that we pulled it off really well. I really hope so, but my mom said that we sounded absolutely great, and she does not give compliments very quickly, so I take it that we did. Mrs. Bizarth said that this was the best Honor Choir concert she'd heard in a few years.   The repertoire consisted of "Hallelujah, Amen" by Handel, "In Stiller Nacht" by Brahms, "O My Luve's Like a Red, Red Rose" by Clausen, "Order My Steps" by Burleigh, and "In Dat Great Gittin' Up Mornin' " by Hairston.  On "Hallelujah, Amen," we practiced with "diggy dum"s to get the buoyancy of the piece going, and we wound up keeping it that way for the concert because it sounded good. The only actual words we sang were "and in songs divine harmonious join" and "amen, hallelujah" at the end. Dr. Raines was hilarious. He stepped on stage and said, "I don't normally like to begin a concert by speaking, but I thought I should inform you that although the program states that the first piece we will be singing is "Halleluja, Amen", we will actually sing a diversion of the words to old English for you. The words are "diggy dum", "diggy" meaning "hallelujah" and "dum" meaning "amen". Thank you." He said all this with the most solemn expression and maintained it as he approached us, even though everyone else broke out into laughter. It was great.   "In Shtiller Nacht" was very difficult but very rewarding. After lots of work on that, we were able to sing the full song in German. It was very intense, and I am now deeply in love with the song and have acquired more knowledge about Brahms and German in general. As a matter of fact, after the concert my mom and I stopped by Publix, and after she bought some beer, Warsteiner, the bagger boy asked us how to pronounce the word, and I was able to tell him the correct pronunciation. That, of course, lead him to question me on my German background, and I simply answered that I'd just learned a song in German. ^.^   "O My Luve..." was just beautiful. We all sang our hearts out, and I'm sure one could tell. The song makes me melt, and we had some really awesome guys in the choir this year, particularly the basses, and the guys' "solo" section almost made me cry.  Side notely, I finally met Hinkle, as the Northgate folks lost their bus for a reason that is still unknown to me and had to ride with us. "Do you know Stephanie Ward?" "Yes" "Are you Hinkle?" "Yes, how'd you know?" Frankly, I don't know how I knew. I just had a feeling he was Hinkle; I knew he was in choir and in my grade, and although there were other NG guys in my choir, he just looked like a Hinkle. He seems like a really nice guy.   And on another note, I don't comprehend the infatuation that everyone appears to have, up to this day, with Shea Henley. I saw him there. He was wearing shades at every single rehearsal-even the dress rehearsal. He removed them for the concert, and I didn't think his eyes were very pretty. I did compliment him on his hair, and although he returned the favour, he still seemed like a bit of a jerkoff to me. The guy standing beside him had saliently beautiful blonde long hair-- even my mom noticed it from the audience, and he stood on the last row. He, too, however, seemed as though he were a jerk. I stood on the second to last of five rows of risers.    On "Order My Steps", we had an awesome soloist. It was a soul piece, and it sounded awesome. Katrina, the soloist, just absolutely kicked a major one. She was unbelievable. The solo involved improvising, and though I'd initially considered trying out, I realized that I'd best leave that to a black girl. Surely enough, Katrina was a large, African American girl, but no one could have done a better job than she did. It turned out that she was the daughter of an ex-nurse of my grandmother; we learned this after the concert. I had talked to the girl during rehersal, and she was very nice.   Although I had initially hated "In Dat...", I came to love it once Dr. Raines taught us how to spice it up. There were two tenor soloists in that piece, and they, too, did a phenomenal job. The piece in general kicked butt.    I sang beside a half Italian girl named Carmela (students are organized by height every year), and she was a fun person to sit by. I got a kick out of it. Of course, once on stage, Alto II's had to stand by me as I was at the end of the Alto I's, and the girl that sang on the other side of me was rude, obnoxious, and added in way more slides than anyone should ever be allowed to ruin music with. She sucked and switched parts according to whichever suited her best at the moment, but oh, well.    I'm so excited. I think I'm going to email the director since I never really got a chance to speak to him because everything was so very rushed.   I didn't get left behind this year, either, and when I thanked Ms. Bizarth for that, she responded with a good, hearty laugh.   It was really eye-opening as far as the passage of time is concerned to watch the younger choirs perform. They were very good, but I couldn't believe I had been there once. It's a strange feeling one gets when he or she stops to think about how far he or she has come.   Initially, I felt really odd about being back at Honor Choir, for Honor Choir is where I essentially met Trey my freshman year. There, I had finally identified the dude with the staring problem at football games. It was just so strange to realize that we had priorly been at the same exact locations (even away from the performing art center) and I had become so honestly infatuated with such an immature guy. I was so stupid. However, these memories were not necessarily bad, for a change. I wasn't depressed because the music made everything worthwhile, and I realized that it's time to be mature and finally really forgive Trey once and for all and move on. I feel a lot more peaceful at the mention of his name than I have felt since the fiasco of a situation that existed and ended in heartbreak.    I am very ready to crash, not having slept enough for a week and having to get up tomorrow and do endless amounts of homework, so I leave you with a song.    "In Stiller Nacht"  Johannes Brahms  (Accents are not in place due to the fact that I'm tired and don't feel like messing with that right now.)    In stiller Nacht, zur ersten Wacht, ein Stimm begunnt zu klagen, In still of night, oh awesome night, a lonely voice is singing,   der nacht'ge Wind hat suss und lind zu mir den Klang getragen; The evening breeze among the trees, to me a sadness bringing.  von herbem Leid und Traurigkeit ist mir das Herz zerflossen,  Throughout my life of pain and strife, my heart is ever broken  die Blumelein, mit Tranen rein hab ich sie all begossen. The blossoms rare weep in despair, for thee in love a token.  Der schone Mond will untergahn,  The friendly moon has gone too soon,   fur Leid nicht mehr mag sheinen,  No more for me aglowing,   die Sternelan ihr Glitzen stan, mit mir sie wollen weinen. The stars once bright are dark at night, their tears with mine are flowing.  Kein Vogelsang, noch Freudenklang man horet in den Luften,  No singing bird aloft is heard, his joyous song is taken,   die wilden Tier raurn auch mit mir Wild creatures mourn alone, forlorn,   in Steinen und in Kluften.  Among the rocks forsaken.   Or two... Clausen wrote the following for his wife. I would melt if anyone ever wrote something like that for me- wouldn't you?   "O My Luve's Like a Red, Red Rose" Music- Rene` Clausen Lyrics- Robert Burns   O my Luve's like a red, red rose,  O my Luve's like a red, red rose  That's newly sprung in June.  O my Luve's like a melodie that's sweetly played in tune.   As fair art thou my bonnie lass so deep in luve am I,  I will luve thee still my dear 'Till a' the seas, 'till a' the seas gang dry.   I will luve thee still my dear,  While the sands of life shall run,  'Till the seas gang dry, my dear,  And rocks melt with the sun.   As fair art thou my bonnie lass, so deep in luve am I, I will luve thee still my dear,  Tho' it were ten thousand,  Tho' it were ten thousand mile.   Tho' it were ten thousand mile.I must say that I am in a far better mood than I was in this time yester-day. I was mostly apathetic throughout most of the day because of a general lack of sleep- again. I'm a bit concerned about that issue. I need sleep, and I'm most certainly exhausted at the end of the day- and yet I cannot sleep. I awaken continuously throughout the course of the night, and I finally fall asleep as soon as my alarm clock sounds, but it is too late to do anything at that point.    On a side note, I am infinitely hyped up about Honor Choir this year. I can't wait to go. I love our music muchly (well, excepting one piece), and I have heard great things about the director. I'm generally hopeful and excited to get to do something I love for a weekend. If you're a lover of choral music and have nothing better to do on Saturday night, come to the concert-admission is free. It is at the Clayton County Performing Arts Center at 6.30 pm. Tuesday there will be a Workshop at Spivey Hall for music education and such. I hopefully will be able to attend, as I really want to. I would need to miss an entire school day; therefore, I shall check to be sure that anything I miss will be easily made up. I really really want to go.    I had an intriguing verbal engagement with Katie today. I wasn't sure such a thing could ever happen, but it did, and it was a nice and satisfying conversation with words being spoken on both ends, as opposed to the usual scenario of my speaking until I am dry of speech. We talked about anthropological behavior and overall flaws and virtues as well as modes of communication and expression.   It was rather enlightening, considering that, throughout my school day, I hardly ever have a chance to exchange any meaningful ideas with anyone.    Yesterday, I had to telephone Charter because my internet was acting screwy. The assistance girl who picked up asked me to repeat the process of unplugging all cords from the wall although I had already attempted that route of action. While we were waiting to restart everything, I asked her how she was doing. I assume that this girl was in desperate need to speak her mind to anyone willing to listen, and she did. Synoptically, she and I conversed for approximately 30 minutes. I think we both needed that, and I was immensely grateful that I was able to somehow, even if in such a minuscule way, aid this girl in oh-so-much distress.   Then, I was connected to technical services, and the man I spoke to was rather rude and of no help, as I wound up figuring out the problem on my own anyway after he told me he could not help.    Random thought that popped in my head just now: I am a damsel in distress daily as I attempt to close my locker. And I had earnestly convinced myself that that would change with the new semester...   Well, I should really go begin my homework now. So, I leave you with a bow as I post the lyrics to a marvelous song.    "Smoke" by Ben Folds Five  Leaf by Leaf and page by page Throw this book away All the sadness, all the rage Throw this book away Rip out the binding and tear the glue All of the grief we never ever knew We had it all along  Now it's smoke  The things we've written in it Never really happened All of the people come and gone Never really lived All of the people have come have gone  No one to forgive smoke We will never write a new one There will not be a new one Another one, another one Here's an evening dark with shame Throw it on the fire Here's the time I took the blame Throw it on the fire  Here's the time we didn't speak It seemed for years and years Here's a secret No one will ever know the Reasons for the tears They are smoke  Where do all the secrets live? They travel in the air You can smell them when they burn They travel Those who say the past is not dead Stop and smell the smoke  You keep on saying the past is not dead Come on and smell the smoke You keep saying the past is not even past You keep saying We are smokeOk. Cafe Mocha and Marley worked. I feel a gazillion times better now. ^.^ *nod nod nod*Well, I'm back again. I feel utter mental incarceration lately, and I am in need of a blog to release my thoughts. Honestly, since school has started, everything has been going downhill. Things I had thought I'd put behind me are resurfacing, my classes are hideously intolerable, and not too much is going right, quite frankly. I've been trying to overlook everything and stay positive, but do you notice that overlooking everything is really hard? So, I'm sitting in calculus attempting to complete an assignment as my boisterous class's members converse exuberantly about nothing with one another, and it hits me:   Mental incarceration is predominant. I'm sitting here, having failed an overly easy homework for unbelievably stupid inattentive mistakes, feeling like slime and wanting to simply vanish because of my approximate geography. I feel tied by everything- my clothing (cold weather is innverving), my classes, the supposed humans surrounding me--the folks near me particularly, throwing me odd looks as I exist, as I breathe, as I'm myself. I wish I had an invisibility cloak right here, right now, and could take my leave.    *Sigh* In all eventuality, I'll become accostumed to my situation and learn how to deal with it, I hope. Things could be about a gazillion times worse, but I can't refrain from detesting the high school world. If it would only end at home... Nothing is wrong, but everything is unbelievably passive, in that cool way that feels almost worse than the heat of a combustion reaction within the boundaries of the home, most likely caused by a heated argument that's happened between my sister and I or my mother and I or perhaps not even involving me.   I don't know whether what I'm experiencing is anger. Anger can be a beautiful thing, as long as it is not utilized as an excuse for destruction. I'm not claiming it that way.                                Have I mentioned that I want to scream at the very top of my lungs?     I think I need a cafe mocha.   And some Bob Marley                                      as I calm down and begin my stupid                                              homework.   And perhaps post a lousy poem of mine.       To Myself  They said to me,  “Little girl, you have a long,  	long way to go.” I said,  “Indeed, my friends, I have a long,  	long way to go.”  “But you’re clever; you’ll excel in many areas,” 		they said. “Oh, but I don’t know,  for you never can tell,” said I.  So is this an egotistical attempt,       a narcissistic disposition to          write a poem to myself,                 for my eyes only,                       to remind myself                           that life is life?                                        Supposedly not,                                   but then, it could be,                            for I could be writing to          somebody else, or about somebody      else- as opposed to writing illogically all over this college ruled morceau de papier                        pezzo di carta                        pedazo de papel-however you say it!             pretending to be a poet.Yesterday was fun. I got nearly nothing accomplished because I went out, and it actually helped me feel somewhat better for a little while (I suppose distraction does that).    I had excessive amounts of chocolate as we made brownies at Clint's and whatnot. Everyone left, though, for a bunch of random and unknown reasons.    Anyway, other than the good food (hehehe), I also watched some good movies, although I was forced to leave before the end of one I was really enjoying because of fear of murder from the motherly unit for coming home entirely too late. Luckily, she wasn't up, although I heard an extended unnecessity about it this morning... =-P   Maybe it was the excess of chocolate that made me have such an awful nightmare, as well as the movie that I was watching before we left, which dealt with the Holocaust.  I dreamt that a Nazi, representing the Angel of Death, came to get me. It was very scary. I woke up sweating and sat there a while. I never seem to be able to remember the good dreams; all I ever remember when I actually  reach  REM are the nightmares. I think the last worst two were seeing a beautiful angel in front of me and, suddenly, a staff flying toward its forehead and killing it. Then there was the one in which daddy was abandoned and died in a very strange land. Honestly, my dreams are so messed up. And there was the one in which Grubbs, Jefts, and Johnson locked me in the trunk of a 1960 VW Bug...  yeah, the trunk...   The pondery mood I wound up in led me to the conclusion that life is a pain in the butt in the sense that anything good seems to fade away immediately and the "bad stuff" seems to linger neverendingly, and it sucks. Lately, it seems as though I'm always working... for nothing. However, life moves on, and so must every living organism that's willing to keep up and avoid death.   On that note, I'm going to find a way to get along with Patrick. I don't know quite how yet- I may need to have a talk with him, but I'm going to get along with him, and I'm going to get up off the floor and learn how to take what life throws at me in a better way than I have been doing lately. Life's too short for dwelling on misery. I mean, I've gone through entirely worse times and made it through.     "Wake Your Mind Up" by 311   Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up Move and rise up before your time's up Clock is ticking, you're caught slippin' Stop to realize, look and listen  Well I guess that's life When you see a dark road up the way And I guess that's life When you gotta roll through anyway Now don't scream, don't fight Fear never ever made it go away Same ghost town as yesterday Made you feel like love was miles away  Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up Move and rise up before your times up Clock is ticking, you're caught slippin' Stop to realize, look and listen  Now those sleepless nights Thoughts just clouding up my brain Feeling helpless, repeating the same Old memories of pain and I wish it would rain, yo Give me starlit skies for dreamland I know it's really smaller than it seems but when The pressure gets under my skin I just wanna get out and scream in the wind, yo  The world we're living in is complicated The streets that we walk on are dark and jaded A wandering suld that's filled with hatred In it is poison, the youth is tainted Social engineering keeps us separated Media control is highly overrated Ignorance is bliss to those uneducated Listen to the message cause it's time we faced it  Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up Move and rise up before your times up Clock is ticking, your caught slippin' Stop to realize, look and listen  I'm controller of my destination Gotta change my mind to help me break away The sun creeps over the hillside to shed this light No man could take away And I guess that's life You see a new side from the norm A new direction and meaning to the form And the calm in the eye of a storm, yo  Show me a desert that can never be drenched I'll show you a thirst that can never be quenched Temptation chronicles, the story of my life Been spent on a dose of balancing strife Inspiration, it comes and goes You can bet when it hits, I'm on the phone Singing to my voicemail trying to get it down In a sensation of shape shifting sound You're telling fables to cover up your foibles From overindulgence on things you find enjoyable Designed to take my mind away from the truth Try to make me out to play the sleuth They want you to think someone's watching you So they can make up a set of rules for you I'm just trying to find a path that I can stomach Just trying to make some sense out from it, uh  Don't stop, don't stop what you got Don't stop til you find the sweet spot  (Awesome, awesome, awesome instrumental part)  Wake your mind up, clear your eyes up Move and rise up before your time's up Clock is ticking, you're caught slippin' Stop to realize, look and listenEghhh... I'm officially sick. I woke up feeling horrendously. I went to bed rather early, too, hoping that sleep would help me feel better, but it didn't exactly work much although I slept for about 11-12 hours.  I did a research on mucus and colds a little while ago and learned a lot.  I'm not sure how much I'll get done today since I don't feel very well at all, and that's bad since horror weeks 1 and 4/5 are coming up, and it doesn't even end there, for about a week later is All-State, and a week later is SAT, then I still need to set up some college visits for Spring Break... and then, of course, there're the two weeks I've been dreading the entire school year: the AP exams. I haven't started preparing for any of this (save for All-State, but only slightly), and I really don't need to be sick now. *Sigh* Believe it or not, though, some good has resulted out of my illness: I have to write a 1.5 page calculus problem (or some length to that extent, I think) for extra credit for Mrs. Dunn, and I've decided that mine will likely, in some amusing form, involve my cold and the exponential rate of growth of my dead white blood cells that cause my mucus to be coloured. Hehe.   Okay, enough for now, I suppose.   I guess I'll try to clean up a little bit and then try to get some schoolwork done.    "Return to Innocence" by Enigma    That's not the beginning of the end That's the return to yourself The return to innocence Love - Devotion Feeling - Emotion  Love - Devotion Feeling - Emotion  Don't be afraid to be weak Don't be too proud to be strong Just look into your heart my friend That will be the return to yourself The return to innocence  If you want, then start to laugh If you must, then start to cry Be yourself don't hide Just believe in destiny  Don't care what people say Just follow your own way Don't give up and use the chance To return to innocence  That's not the beginning of the end That's the return to yourself The return to innocence  Don't care what people say Follow just your own way Follow just your own way Don't give up, don't give up To return, to return to innocence. If you want then laugh If you must then cry Be yourself don't hide Just believe in destiny.Snowless snow day yesterday. Wonderful!  No snow day today. =-(  Not so wonderful.   Today I got a new lab partner, but it's not a good thing, contrary to what I thought it would be. So, I no longer have to deal with Hope and all our arguments, but now I have to deal with Patrick. I normally like Patrick all right and he's pretty cool to talk to, but lately he's been a real jerk, and today was simply not good in chemistry. He argues with everything I say and extends everything to insufferable whining and drama. Normally, I could deal with that all right, but I am under lots of pressure lately, and my home is very full of drama lately, so I'm not sure how this will work out.   I'm definitely not looking forward to Patrick's next bad day; we seem to have bad days simultaneously, too, and if you know me, then you likely know that that will not be a good thing at all if I'm approached the wrong way.   Besides that, any fun that I might have gotten out of chemistry class is pretty much shattered. I cannot begin to describe just how much amusement I got from watching Michael and Jay's modes of strange communication and laughing at Jay. Really, now! All my entertainment's gone.  Well, at least I'm at Katherine's table now. And I no longer face the board... again. Meh.  Otherwise, my day wasn't particularly bad, other than the fact that I've been sneezing and sore-throated and runny-nosey all day. I've been sick pretty much all week, and it is not so cool. The next 1.5 weeks will not be very nice.    Well, on the bright side, tonight I'm home and kicking back for the most part. I'm about to have some really good hot cocoa, so that makes up for a not-so-terribly-awesome day, right?   "Smoke" by Natalie Imbruglia   My lullaby  Hung out to dry What's up with that It's over Where are you, dad Mom's looking sad What's up with that It's dark in here  Why bleeding is breathing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I used to  My mouth is dry Forgot how to cry What's up with that You're hurting me I'm running fast Can't hide the past What's up with that You're pushing me  Why, bleeding is breathing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I used to  Why, believing is breathing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I saw you crawling on the floor Why, bleeding is believing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I saw you crawling to the door Why, bleeding is believing You're hiding underneath the smoke in the room Try, bleeding is believing I saw you falling on the floorThere's this thing going around in live/webjournals everywhere.

Didn't get to make up the calculus quiz I needed to make up like I intended to do, and I'm not sure that I'll be able to get around to it very soon now. Things are coming to a semi-close, and I'm never practically ready (although spiritually, I always am).  'Nuff said about that.    On a different note, what is insanity? I can't really plug in a definition, what with the numerous relations that exist.  Sometimes I think I may have lost my sanity half my life ago. I was 8 years old, and something really weird happened-- I don't know what it was-- I didn't then, and I still don't know. One day, I just started crying and couldn't stop. There was a reason, but I couldn't explain it- not even to myself. And up to this day, I have no clue what happened. I was terrified and insecure and saddened and anguished and ashamed about it. The day I burst out into tears in church with a group of concerned people futilely attempting to consolate me was the day my mother said it had to stop. I didn't mean to cry; and yet I couldn't stop.   This continued for an extended period of time, and I was on the verge of seeing a psychologist when it stopped. Again, I don't know how nor why it stopped. It just did.   Maybe my subconscious regret for causing so much trouble made it stop. That's my best theory up until now, although I have none to explain its commencement.    And then everything was different. I don't know how nor why, but it was.    I don't know whether anyone shares such a strange episode with me, but I think that's when the general concept of rational thought process I had left me.  It amazes me how much fear people have of their own minds. I'm faulty of it, too, sometimes, until I return to my original stand that the mind is a gift and must be accepted as is, no matter how wacky it may seem. I actually like to appreciate that wackiness in other people, for they're those who aren't afraid of thinking. In essence, it's really not so scary, and it's okay to diverge from the flow.   At one point in my life-- namely, roughly two years ago- there was light, and although things were still never the same, they were better this time. I've drifted so far away from it, and I'm waiting on something to fall out of the sky for me. Literally. And I actually think that it'll happen.    So, if you think I'm a little out of it, don't penalize me for it. I don't mean badly, and it's not so bad. Really.    "With Every Light" by Smashing Pumpkins   Taking over  We're taking over  Throw the weight up off you shoulders now  That we can show our love  It's almost over it's almost over  No more war and no more soldiers  To stand against His love  Away with all the troubles that you've made  Away with waiting for another day  Away  Look ma the sun is shining on me  Impatient, in love and aching to be  Could you believe in heaven  If heaven was all you had  We're taking over we're taking over  Throw away your four leafed clovers  And stand beside this love  Away with everything you've grown to hate  Away with anything that holds you safe  Away  And every light I've found  Is every light that's shining down on me  I'm never alone  Look ma the sun is shining on me  Taking my time to do as I please  Could you believe in heaven  If heaven was all you had  The sun is beaming, radiating  All the love we are creating  We are creating  And every light I've found  Is every light that's shining down on me  I'm never aloneYesterday was exciting. It was the set day for the Futures program, an event at Georgia Tech for prospective female students which lasted all day, and I've determined that I am definitely applying. I absolutely LOVED Tech... If I don't go into music and therefore wind up within a mathematically involved field, I want to go there-- granted that I get in, that is. It's as though it were made for me; I realize that if I do wind up attending there, it will be a very rigorous scholastic experience that will allow me to have nearly no life, but it really seems like an awesome school (even after all the horror stories that some people from there have recounted).  I met a really cool girl from Texas who hung out with us throughout the day, and there was a really large amount of people from all over the country.  During the initial information session, a helium balloon set off a fire alarm, and we halfway evacuated until they realized that the culprit of setting it off was but a balloon. That was fairly amusing. My favourite speaker was a lady who was an Aerospace Engineer; she was very cool and very encouraging as well as foreign although, if she hadn't mentioned it, I would have never guessed her to be foreign. On the other hand, when we split up into groups by major, I was very confused. The program folks said that, were we to be interested in more than one major, we could divide our time into different sessions and simply move around. I wanted to go to both Engineering and Sciences, and, because Engineering was in a different building, I went there first. So, about halfway through Engineering, I left for Sciences, but, for some odd reason, Sciences ended half an hour earlier than it was supposed to, causing me to only catch the last ten minutes and then return to Engineering. The Engineering folks were cool, although the first speaker was obviously a hispanic woman with a nearly incomprehensible, strong accent- hence, I only caught about half of what she was saying. There was also a very nice professor, but she spoke entirely too softly, and from the rear end of the room, I could not hear a thing she was saying, which was a shame.  The only part I disliked about it was the President's Scholarship section of the day; two female representatives who had priorly received the scholarship spoke, and they were stupid, obnoxious, and entirely incompetent as far answering a question effectively goes although they were overly skilled at giggling incessantly for no reason. Ugh. I sincerely wanted to take my awesome Tech cup and throw it at one of them, hoping that the other would be stupid enough to run toward it and get hit, too.  The tour was pretty fun; although it wasn't as specific as I'd hoped (though I didn't expect anything incredibly specific in so little time) and I didn't get to sit in through any lectures, I saw "the beach" (hehe) and the horrible part of campus involving fraternities and sororities... *shivers* I really detested that part of the tour. Honestly, I didn't quite realize how many morons somehow managed to get into Tech. All the same, I'm a bit concerned about admission, but that's not something to worry about for a little while longer-- I've got other things to be thinking about right this very now.  It was funny to see some frightened expressions on students' faces, though. It seemed as though they had never seen that many females at once. At one point during break, I looked up and saw this dude gaping at me, and that was kind of weird. I think the tour guide, a sophomore engineer, was checking me out, but at least he was cute. That did make me a bit uncomfortable, so I just looked at the buildings, which was the purpose of the tour anyway.    All in all, I liked Tech a lot and felt as though it could be the right educational place for me (save for the frightening female:male ratio and the community restrooms).   Afterwards, I went to Lyndsey's, and her dad taught me how to shoot a rifle and a pistol. Wow-- pistols are really hard to shoot, and they bounce back entirely too much, but the rifle was pure fun. I was doing great, too. The very first shot I took, I hit the target (a can), which is something I'm very proud of. Right in the letter "o" of it, too! And at one point, I had about 10 or 11 consecutive successful shots... I like shooting entirely too much, hehe. I want to do it again. ( Not  on anything living, worry not!!!)   ^.^   Well, there's a lot to do today, involving mounds of makeup work for missing school yesterday (though it was totally worth it), so I'd better get started, or something of the like, anyway. Toodles!   "Neither Heaven nor Space" by Badly Drawn Boy   So quiet  It's neither heaven nor space, it's just high And the ring around the moon Looks like light and love Neither of which I get enough of Down there Where alot of people lie in a deep sleep  And months on end go by, in a single week  Down there  But much too slow  Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole? The air is running out, we're sinking much too low And if you sit long enough You can hear ghost trains As if the city speed Is just in our brains And coaxes close as we get to sugar cane Down there  But much too slow Can't you see I'm trying so hard to plug up this hole? The air is running out we're sinking much too low So quiet So quiet It's neither heaven nor space It's just high And the ring around the moon Looks like light and love Neither of which I get enough of Neither of which I get enough ofHmmm... what a day! It actually started out all right, but then I became very depressed as I realized that I am an utter chemical imbecile although it's all right. History was annoying, and in Calculus I took a quiz feeling like poo and continued feeling that way until choir came about. Choir was really good, for a change. We broke into many small groups, and my group was cool. Of course, we did have the best sight readers of the class, but what really fueled it was the fact that everyone in the group actually  wanted  to make music. The group included me, Kim, Misha, Crisha, and Megan (or, the entire audible Alto section), Patrick, Neris, Cassius (who seemed grumpy as usual, though he was the only one, really), Erin, Jessica, and some other sophomores whose names I didn't know, but it was fun. We worked really well together and got a lot done, though we felt as though we'd failed as we slipped out of tune for a measure or two according to B when sight reading some lines for her the first time through. But we got over it.   The good block lifted me up a significant bit, considering that I was really down. Although it may seem that I'm always unhappy, I'm really not. Yesterday was pretty good; excepting an initial overly disastrous incident which happened first thing in the morning that I'd rather not get into recounting right now, some good things happened. We had a good, productive rehearsal in choir, and I got my Honor Choir CD. The recording could have been better, but it could have been worse, too. I also realize that it  is  a recording and is therefore bound not to sound as good as the actual live performance. ^.^ I liked Honor Choir this year.    I found out that I can "ooo" my way through my entire All State audition, which is something I'm very prone to doing (save for a few fragments here and there on which I  need  words to sing it correctly).    Besides all this, I'm one confused camper (imagine that!) more than ever now. I have no clue what I'm doing... I hope I figure things out before I make an even greater mess...  On a side yet more important note, 5-0=4, as I claimed on my last AP Quackulus test... Just as long as CPP doesn't find out and kick me off the math team, I will be all right *giggles*.   All right, well, I'd better get to homework! Laters gaters!    I am exceedingly obsessed with this song:    "Innocence Again" by Switchfoot   Do you remember when You were way back then You held the world inside your hands When you told me love Was the strongest stuff Your strength was innocence  But, oh man The signs of the times are omens You're starting the day in No man's land again   Who are you gonna be? When you're on your knees, who do you believe?  Fear is a lonely man You've been given innocence You've been given innocence again  You should know by now That your darkest hour Is when your broken heart goes down It's a bitter end When the sweet begins Grace is sufficiency  But, oh dear, we'll never deserve it No dear, we never could earn it Now, here the choice is yours  Grace is high and low We'll never be the same  oh, oh, oh... You've been given innocence, innocence, innocence. Who are you gonna be... You've been given innocence.Organized society. It's innerving. I realize that I, too, formerly took part in things that fall under this category, but I no longer stand it. I suppose that what truly angers me is the fact that everyone seems to deceivingly put up a show of happy-go-roundness at all times. It's not real. Why hide what's there? I don't understand.  Of course, I have had my negative experiences with it to make me despise it, too, but then I somehow learned that I shouldn't attempt to comform to set standards simply to appease hypocritical views anyway. If they can't understand, it doesn't matter. They likely weren't meant to anyway, at that point.    Closed mindedness. I'm very likely faulty of this myself, but I have no tolerance for deliberately conscious closed mindedness. What's with the box, dude?   Disrespect for one's own mind.  So, one really admires something but denies it so as to agree with someone else in order to please them. And that? A no-no. Sincerely. Respect for one's own mind... ever heard of that?    Mah, I'm living up to the Darian aspect of myself, criticizing society down to the marrow and just wanting to complain about everyone and everything. But it's my blog, and it's a free country, so I can do this and go unharmed!!   Imagine that.   I'm just ranting as though I were a rampaging old hag, just smashing words down inconsequently and hoping that no one will ever bring this entry up to me, for that might not be a good idea.   Just GAH. GAH. GAH. GAH.         I hate this town, I hate this state, I hate this country, I hate this continent, and, quite frankly, I hate this planet! And maybe even this galaxy, too!!!

You are attracted to those who are warm and obedience.  2.  In the process of courtship, the approach that would make you     feel irresistable is creative, never let you feel bored.  3.  The impression you would like to give to your lover is loyal,     faithful, never change.  4.  You don't like it when your partner is emotional and/or too     moody; and you don't know how to please him/her.  5.  The kind of relationship you would like to build with your     partner is one that you care not only about the present but     also the future with your partner, a long-lasting relationship     that you can grow with.  6.  You care about the society and morality, you won't do anything     wrong after marriage.  7.  You think of marriage as a precious thing.  Once you get married,     you'll treasure it and your partner very much.  8.  At this moment, you don't have the thirst for love, you can't do     anything for it, you won't fall for it easily.  true true true. ah trueAH omg! i forgot to tell yall something. that night after i finsihed watching the ring i was really really scared right? so i asked my lil sis to sleep in the gameroom with me. after getting all my blankies and all my pillows and my melody, i turned off the lights and boom... it hit me!

I stole out quietly, slipping out the back gate and crouching in a bush. There, covered in a black velvet cape I waited oh so quietly for them to appear. I shivered, my breath a frostly cloud as I looked up at the sky. The moon was covered by dark black clouds, the stars hiding out of fear. Tonight was a good night for following, hardly any light. A lone owl hooted softly in the distance, it's cry traveling softly in ripples across the forest. Then I saw it. Only a pinprick of light at first, then more and more as their torches grew nearer. Where were they getting the flame? I wondered silently. They voices grew shrill and mocking, closer and closer they came. I tried to crouch lower, digging my fingernails into the old soil. I saw them approach slow motion, like out of a nightmare. I had never been this close, I could smell their rotting flesh, almost feel their greasy, torn hair. They screached and bellowed. I saw Lily, oh my dear sweet Lily look up to my window. She looked almost saddened not to see me, and for a fraction of a second I thought I saw emotion. They had become more violent recently, once in a while ripping one of their own to shreds, leaving us the dissarayed carcas the next morning. This evening they went for Lisa Ann, the prom queen. Always a beauty, I watched as four of them jumped on her, I listened to her barbaric screams, I watched eyeballs being ripped away from their sockets, hair pulled straight from the head, I heard the loud crack of her neck as it snapped in two. I felt her pain as a silent tear slid down my pale face, falling quietly onto the grass. They grew bored of this, and after a few hours they retreated into the early hours. I had watched, noticing they never looked back once, but I still kept out of sight as I followed behind. Always keeping them just within eye reach. Deep within the forest we trudged. They grew silent, and lurched quickly, almost galloping to their destination. Then we came to it and I stopped dead. It had been so obvious, so cliche so apparent and we had all just forgotten. How could we have forgotten about The Mayson Residence, deep within the forest. Old hermit Mayson we had called him, it had always been a joke within the Windsor kids that one day they were going to storm his house and throw a huge party. How ironic I thought as I stood there, wind whipping my face as I watched them reel into the old castle. It was dilapidated, the stone and wood groaning from age and wear. The perfect place to hide I thought bitterly. I was so wrapped up in my thoughts, I didn't realize I had walked into the front lawn of the vast estate. I heard a window bang and looked up sharply. Lily leaned out of a second story window, gaping smile, eyes boring into my soul. "Meredith!" She called in a deep sing- song voice, eyes glittering blankly. She leaned out of the window, her arms thrust towards me. "Come join us Merry! You always were my favorite!" I felt my knees give out, I licked my lips- dry and chapped form the cold winter wind. "No" I said quietly, a whisper at most. I fell to my knees, looking up at her. I heard them running down the stairs, so did she. Her eyes bulged, she did not expect them to find me. I was her, her prize, her possession. I looked up at her smiling. "Another time my old friend" I said sweetly, and then spit at the ground below her. Rising, I looked up into her eyes and she howled a dark, monstrous groan. I turned around and ran, arms and legs pumping from adrenaline. I stopped to see them halt at the door, for already the sun had begin to awaken. They grew angry and frusturated, their bodies lurched with anger. They threw one young man I didn't recognize onto the lawn in front of them. He screamed and tried to make it back inside, crawling slowly as his flesh melted off his bones. His carcass steamed and hissed and bubbled and oozed and diluted grey flesh fell like rivers off his dying body. Then, all at once the horrible screaming stopped. I looked in shock to the others where they hid inside the doorway, the sunlight not quite up to the doorstep. They looked at me, smiling a knowing smile. They weren't crazy, I thought, just sick. I walked quietly back to the WIndsor Mansions, engrossed in thought. Somehow I would make them pay, somehow I would watch them all die, slowly and with a great satisfaction. I would watch as Lily cowarded under my wrath, and with her last dying breath she would call for me, and I would sit just out of her reach, smiling and singing her lullaby- just for her.I sat there Playing alone on the attic floor dust rolled by and I smiled The rain beat against the windows But the wind protected my pigtails and curls And you forgot So I sat there And found your secrets Hidden in the dust I sat there, angelic and so naive As the storm howled a warning I shouldnt have opened those boxes But I was so little Why did you box up such horrible manifestations I let them out, untied the string Down it fell, warmed over by dirt and old stories I was so little, much too young to learn of such pain But you forgot So I sat there Pigtails bouncing, eyes wide open I sat thereFirelight fled up and down their wild faces And welled up in their eyes in orange tatters Soot polished their hands Their tanned muscles torn and ripped As they danced around the fire Their bodies cast dancing glows Embers fluttered like fire butterflies Slowly crushed into ash piles The fire roared and bellowed Licked and leaped Wild and crazy as the men around itThree little girls All cross legged in a circle They shook their heads and laughed and smiled Pigtails bouncing, eyelids fluttering Then the man came They turned, slow motion Fright crawled up their necks Blew in their ears Whispered in their bright blue eyes Dressed in black He walked silently over to them, and hovered They stopped giggling The pony tails silenced and hushed He smiled, grandly and flourished his cane "Tonight!" his voice boomed "Tonight is the night you shall LIVE!" he sang The little girls looked at one another  One stifled a giggle One tugged at a curl The other wiped dust of a Mary Jane His laughter cut out They looked up questionly Only to see a different man An angry man in his place Same clothes, same skin But different "Hello I'm Mary!" said the second little girl Looking up politely with eyes of cornflower "Hello Mary, I'm the Devil" said the bright, burning coalsThere's a place I call home Not many of you have been there Not many of you would understand I have sisters there In this home of mine Sisters that are deeper than blood That swim in the lakes My sisters and I We fly through the mountains And sit under the shade Of all the tall, tall pine trees This place I call home I can walk through the dust And sing songs and give hugs whenever I want Fires burn bright in my home Crackling and sputtering  In my home Animals call out in the midnight The stars sing back Glittering diamonds beckoning I sit here in society And miss the smells the sounds and the taste I miss my sisters But next summer When the sun is bright We will fly and run and sing once again In my home That they too can understandLily's Lullaby- Part FIVE  I became obsessed with my new vampire friends. I never saw the other people in the household, and after a while they gave up on me and just let me do as I pleased. My own mother eventually ignored me, but I didn't care. It was sad how cold we had grown towards one another, but we all knew that we would rather our neighbor die then ourself. Then one night I knew what I had to do. I had to find where they hid during the day. Always from the east they came, but we had been over that area many times, it just opened up into miles and miles of forest. We had all stood on the brink of that hill during the sunny afternoon, shaking our heads in disgust because we all knew it was impossible to find them in that mess. But somehow, somehow it must be possible. I knew I would have to find a way to detect their hiding place, or we would all be driven mad by their nightly singing and taunting. So one night, I did the unspeakable. I followed them.Lily's Lullaby- Part FOUR  A month now. Dull repition had sludged into the Windsor Mansions. We spent our days filling up with supplies, maintaining our fort. By nights we ate quietly, listened to music or read in the library. I spent many of my nights hidden deep within the library. Fortresses of books hid me, but my real reason there was to learn. I gather books about science and medicing until one day I found it. It had been written a long time ago, by a man most likely put in a penitentiary for such radical ideals. His first page caught my eye.   Vampirism is a rare but real disease. Another name for it is pofiria. It causes changes in the blood formula: shortage of erythrocytes and iron. For a "normal" life the ill people really need blood, but not necessarily human. Receptiveness to the sunlight grows, which can cause burns even after a short period, so the vampires lead a night life, their faces whiten, bodies get skinny and so they look like classical bloodsuckers from books.   Physicians do not agree on the causes and development process of the disease. It is often said that it is being formed at genetics level, but alcohol abuse, hepatizes, some medical drugs overdose can also cause the disease.    I knew immediately that my childhood fear had manifested. Little darlings all over the world gave a silent scream as they shared in my pain. I knew, that somehow I had to stop the Windsor beauties from spreading, I knew that the vampires must be killed effectively and quickly.TITLE HAS BEEN FOUND thanks to one mr.

That first night was pure fear dripped drop by drop into a great basin stored by Satan. They had broken through the windows, running into the house- their bodies mangled and bloody from ragged glass. My father's body we found the next morning, or rather, what was left of it. They had clawed through his stomach, ripping out organs and using the blood to write profanities on the house walls in typical teenage angst. In the house they had reeled, our only reason for survival was of pure speed. All I remember is running, legs pumping heart stabbing and looking behind me. There were three of them immediately trailing me, bodies reeling and eyes glazed- maniac laughter boomed through the house. We lost some of the older servants, but my heart had grown cold and I only thought to Darwin that night. We hid in the basement, doors barred with steel as we listened to their moaning and unearthly laughter beat at the doors. We lay there, water dripping in little rivlets, dark shadows choking us, as they pounded against the great oaken doors. Their need for fresh blood drove them crazy, we could see through their glittering eyes. The sun eventually rose into another cold, frostbitten morning- and then they were gone. We emerged from our black tomb cold, wet and shaken. But we were stronger. From that day forth we experimented and through trial and tribulation found what they feared and what they dispised. My father's death was a model for what could happen to all of us, a vision that made us work all the longer. During the day we would run to the nearby stores just down the hill, ignoring decaying bodies and push our way into the delapidated grocery and hardware stores. Here we stocked up on the essentials- nails, canned goods, wood, tools. These are what kept us alive. We built up our fortress, knowing no other way to live. It was grim, but human instinct kept us from giving up. They showed up every night, always coming from over the hill facing east- brandishing torches that made their faces glow and jump with flame. Their routine never differed. ALways the same horrific, mechanical spinning and jerking that they called dancing. Always Lily looking up towards my third story window where I hid and watched, always her smiling that monstrous smile and singing to me. Her voice always seemed to reach me, shrill and so alarming, yet soothing. It made me dizzy, and sometimes I found myself yearning to be with her. The days grew shorter and shorter, and the nights stretched themselves into great black ribbons of hell. I found myself being driven slowly crazy as I watched them arrive by nightfall, so thirsty and so willing.Lily's Lullaby- Part TWO  I fell back from the window sobbing and shaking. I heard their laughter grow louder and it filled my ears like an unrelenting wave. We sat there in that cold, cold room just listening for a while, as it began to drive us all quietly mad. I looked over to see my father rocking back and forth on the rug. His eyes were glazed and he kept humming soft lullabies. "Pappa?" I called timidly? He looked at me, eyes darting and crazy. "Don't look at the window" He said calmly, and brandished an old wooden bat and walked out of the room. A thin whisper shook through me, knowing that I shouldn't look, but my mind got the better of me. My head turned slowly, eyes wide in anticipation. We had placed wood in front of the window, and as I turned I noticed it was stripped clean.  Lily stood rigid and placid, grinning from ear to ear just staring at us all. A shrill scream filled the room and I realized it was coming from my own throat. Lily's face changed, she grew angry and berserk. Clawing at her hair and eyes, her long sharp nails grew streams of blood from her molding cheeks. She pounded at the windows, and just as they seemed they were going to break she fell. It was too dark to see what had happened, but I heard the bat crack in half just as Lily's insane laughter mixed with the dying cries of my father.   *To be Continued*It would take a lifetime to explain How wonderful you really are It would take me just about forever To raise myself up to your par So for now I'll sit in the shadow of your fame For now I'll be your little secret So there won't be any shameLily's Lullaby- Part ONE  They come at night mainly. Throbbing crowds of them, gaunt and pale. Jeering, singing and always dancing. The dancing was the worst, running through your head like a broke- down movie. Their thin bodies jerked around like puppets on strings. We hid in the Windsor Mansions because they were afraid of them. Of course they were, those mansions had been their homes. They were the Windsor Children, once beautiful, once wealthy. All of the children were dubutants, scholars, athletes and prom kings and queens. Loved and despised, these angels had everything handed to them on a silver platter. And then the plague.  It started as a whisper, a mere rumor. Then one night it was breathing down your neck. It swept through the town of Windsor, killing the old and young, the sick and deranged. It left only the youngest and fittest, mutating them into something from hell. My family worked in a mansion, and we saw the disease coming so we hid. We hid in the deepest bowels of the house that only we the workers knew of. We hid as their once bronzed, toned bodies turned ash grey and limp. Their golden and raven curls fell out in thin patches. They ran around their castles  clawing their eyes out and frothing at the mouth. They ran around in splendor, knocking priceless vases and tearing countless paintings. Out into the roads they tore, horrible and gruesome monsters as a madness began to settle into them. And there we watched, the maids, butlers and gardeners who had know the inner workings of the houses and hid from the contamination that was induced from blood trading. I watched through cracks in the walls as the people I had waited on died of turned mad. It was a cruel sense of pleasure to watch them writhe, a grim satisfaction in being in charge and safe as the wealthy lost their once beautiful bodies and minds. After they left, we crept out from our hiding places, half- starved and scared mindless. The first morning we barricaded doors and windows, turning frantic as nightfall approached, for we all dreaded night. They always came out in the night, going God knows where when daylight broke. The first night was horrible. We sat there in a great dining room that had belonged to the McMasters. John, Debora and daughter Judy had dined there in splendor. That afternoon I had helped to burn the corpses ofJohn and Debora. Judy had been driven crazy, joining the others as the undead. We sat there, a group of ten maybe, huddled together bracing knives and bats. The sun melted, the room darkened and so did our spirits. My brother William sat up stiffly and flicked on a light.  The room filled with light and we could see clearly. That's when the singing began. We were a quiet, grim group until we heard singing off in the distance. We cast quick glances at one another, trying to ignore the horrible noise. Shrill, squealing voices like an out of turn piano. The voices came close to the house, louder and louder the shrillness became. I snuck a peak through the boarded up windows. Splashes of light crept through the boarded glass and allowed me to faintly see the outside landscape. There they were, dancing in circles in front of the house. Their bodies were sickly and thin, pale grays and whites. Their eyes glittered black, their entire pupil a deep tar color. They flaunted their decrepid bodies to one another, laughing at the moon and each other. Their laughter was horrible, deep and trembling, as if it had sprung from the devil itself. I spotted a girl I had waited upon, Lily. OUr eyes met at the same time and her mouth opened wide to reveal a mouth filled with fangs. Her lips curled back in a menacing smile and she began to slowly sing the lullaby I had once sung to her. "Lily my love, now you must sleep" Her body swayed slowly as she sang and her eyes glittered with cruel satisfaction. "Come out and play Meredith!" she called to me, thin arms beckoning.   *To be continued*I lived a good long part of my life feeling uninspired. Sitting there bland on the brink of imagination, tendrils of creativity just out of reach Something snapped then, I remember it one rainy afternoon The rain poured down, creating little rivers on the window I looked out of and then I found myself Thank youSummer Storm  Wind howls, shaking the farm like a monkey rattles a cage. It shrieks, and the old home moans in reply. The dust picks up, whipping around like a pair of jack rabbits. Dirt bites at the man like an angry dog. His eyelids shut and he licks the air- already damp and dark. The rocking chair on the front porch creaks with anticipation Dirt- creased eyelids snap open and survey  "Summer storm" he sighs The corn nods and sways in time.Our society wants so much to exist Reality is such a baled myth. We beat our heads to strive for conformity We sit in rows, and stand in lines because those are the rules.

I'm tall and skinny and pale and dirty blonde and i have worries and problems and factors.

Of course it was him, I'm not stupid. His eyes never quite met mine after that, his arm never again accidently brushed mine. Crazy of course that I ever did care.

Windows open all the way People on thei doorsteps, licking shade from dark corners Swear poured into the sewers The men took their shirts off in protest, as the women eyed them jealously Long hair sticking to their back Someone began singing along in a slow, drunken voice "My baby, she's just fine" The sun rose with the temperature Heat washed over them all.One woman middle of the stage The club is pitch black, on lone spotlight glares down of her. She sits, poised on a black metal chair He black hair swept back into a tight bun Heavy white powder covers her face and neck, thick black eyelashes lay closed. Her mouth lay in a cranberry pout. Her dancer body lay wrapped around the metal, cold mixed with heat. A piano plays a key, the eyelashes open. "Showtime" The cranberries whisperA special goodnight to the man in his car, wishing he was dead Don't worry sir, you're doing fine...just fine.His eyes, I tried, I really swear I tried to look past them. Look at his mouth, the hate, the lyrics, his hair so wild and mad.  But his eyes held me close, strangling me with all the anger they held. Im sorry, I whispered, as I ran away from those eyes.Inhale  The boy and girl are so in love Waves wash across as they both watch the sun melt. Water kisses her freckles, sand hugs his hair She glances over, just as the sun turnes a ruby red His eyes glimmer with sun and love. She nods, and agrees- it is beautiful. She takes her small white hand, and squeezes it. Laying her head on his shoulder, she breathes in. Dont forget to fall in love, she will later tell their children, don't forget.Goodnight to the dreamers, the lovers, the artists the athletes and a special goodnight to the little girl curled up in a window seat, looking at the stars and wishing she was one of them"She was so beautiful, a saint" They all nod and pretend to weep Women pretend to hunt for kerchiefs while checking the time. What to say about Lisa Ann... the preist pauses and looks down in the casket before him There lay a woman, who  was a beauty MOre than a beauty, just amazing But her spite and anger kept them away.

My castle is away from humanity, away from you.  You giggle as if you know me, as if I'm here.Dream of the world. I watch your eyes drip with the dew of the Andes, your forehead sweat from Bora Bora, your body is scented with African dirt. Your mouth opens and you sing, arms flailing like birds, legs like a gazelles- you're so full of culture, so full of magic. Your song is too great for words, too beautiful to be tied down to one language. A thousand voices, a thousand tales, a thousand lives. All from your body- you leap and swing and bound and twirl- singing all the while. I sit perched on a rock, enraptured. SO this is why I love you.Why are we Afraid? Whats in the essence of fear that can silence a room, kill a man- stop the world? Why are some hysterical, and some irrelevant? Fear is not it, but rather manifestated by a little child late at night, slapped into the woman being raped, slammed into the man watching his child die. But fear is delicious. We plunder these feelings off one another to feel good about ourselves. Fear evokes emotion, emotion evokes passion. So why are we so afraid?Sometimes I get inspired Doesn't everyone now and then? It's nothing special to you, but to me it's the worl I judge people too quickly, I say things too fast Sometimes I'll just sit and watch, and do you know what I learned?

Sun beat down on the man and his road Silence beat down on the traveler and the traveled.Welcome friends and foes.... Finally found a way to keep track of all the crazy stuff I write, so here it goes!Star Flight  He watched as the universe soared above, then closer and then past Stars rushed by and planets danced Sparkling diamonds fell within his reach His breath fogged the window of the ship And he quickly wiped it away To drink in more of the amazing heavens So whatcha do boy? The cop asked roughly I killed a man, said the watcher simply The cop shiftly uncomfortable and sidled away from the man Why would you do a thing like that? Asked the cop, raising his eyebrows and exchanging looks with another police man The inmate looked silently out of the rocket that was to bring him to a barren deserted planet for convicted felons He looked into the heavens, into the beautiful belt of planets and stars He stared wide and long, and at last broke into a big smile Where else could I see heave in all it's glory He said with a wide sweep of his hand towards the window The cop guffawed loudly So you're willing to give up your whole life for a three minute glance at some stars?

Getting kicked out of school again was the least of her worries, it was more a problem of her dreams. They had started less than a month ago, always getting more and more realistic. Always the same girl, beautiful and regal with eyes brimming with sorrow. Always the crying and pleas for help. Kaela twisted her long blue ponytail around her finger, tighter and tigher until her finger turned red. Lost in thought she groaned as she heard the bell ring in the distance. Kaela scooped up her bag and sprinted home, narrowly missing students heading home after a long day of school. She used her key to get in, and was nearly knocked over by her oversized labrador. "Hey, you damn mutt" she said affectionately, patting his head and scratching him under his chin. She strode into the kitchen, dropping her bag on a chair and peering at a note tacked on the food projector. Her mother was in Reno again, with that new boyfriend of hers, Sam or Cam or something. Kaela sighed and walked quietly into the living room, switching on the monitor and flopping onto the couch. Cartoons displayed around her head, playing hologrpahic images beating each other senseless. Kaela closed her eyes, lulled by the afternoon heat.  She was back, in that world with her. Kaela opened her eyes and stretched her limbs yawning and looking around. "Please" said a voice quietly. "Please, you must help us Kaela," She strode out from the shadow of a tall building, beautiful and elegant. Kaela turned to look at her, and found she could talk. "Where am I?" She asked slowly, still sleepy and confused. "I've brought you here," The girl said quietly, "I don't know how long you will stay this time, but you're here and you must help." Kaela eyed the girl and her surroundings. She seemed out of place, for her setting was a dreary alleyway, complete with fog and crowded, dirty homes. "What do you want from me?" asked Kaela suspiciously. "It's your time," The girl said as she strode forward. Her hand slid into Kaelas, and the world began to melt, "It's time for you to meet your destiny."Silver Sun  It started a long time ago. She knew of it every since she was a young child, barely able to stand. Their ships had flown down, gleaming underbellies glaring in the hot sun. Naive young civilians crept out of their houses and cramped apartments, curious as wide- eyed children. They played music and marched gaily in the streets. Visitors! They cried with jubilancy. From another planet! Another cry rang out. Warm, stiff July breezes rose swirling dirt around the landed rockets. Too many to count, like silver sardines lined up in a row. Alice was there, just like all the others, pigtails curled up with red and blue ribbons, eyes glowing and streamers in hand. That had been many years ago, the streamers and ribbons and music all swept away by the July wind. They doors had opened up. Great steel fortresses pried their mouths open, leaving gaping black holes. The music and giggles died down as steamed hissed from deep within the shining metal rockets. They stepped back, slowly at first and then a stumbled run, panic flew through Alice as they emerged. Gaunt, tall skeletons, lean and musclular. A dullish rubber sheen to their skin was dulled in comparison of their rockets. Their eyes were insect like, and clicked and hummed. They twitched their heads, rotating them and moving their joints like newly oiled machines. Their limbs were long and thin, but strong like wire pulled taut. They wore no clothes, baring smooth strong skin. They raised their hands to the people, fingers outstretched and long. The humming and clicking grew louder, and more metallic. Her mother gripped her hand tightly and whirled to run away. A stinging metal shot fired through the air, hitting Alice's mother square in the back. Alice felt the impact and was pulled down with her mother. She screamed as her hand was pulled from her mothers. More metal zings followed, and Alice watched in horror as neighbors and teachers and former gardeners fell to the ground, gasping for life. She ran, ducking and dodging the falling bodies, blocking out the screams and chaos. Her streamer was torn from her hand, trampled by boots and heels. She tripped and fell, knocked to the ground by a falling body. There she lay trapped, for many hours until at last, all was silent. Alice lay crying, and for a child of five she lay very still and was very good. She knew that her mommy would be proud of her, and would maybe even take her down to the soda fountain that next afternoon. So she lay there, very quietly and very good. The stars crept out, shining merrily and twinkling down on the little town, that lay so quiet and still.He crept silently through the kitchen, down on all fours to avoid being seen. He was silent and dark, hidden in shadow. Quietly he crept across the floor, pausing only momentarily once in a while to cock his head and listen to the quiet hum of the stove. The back door was locked, and he grunted in frusturation. He squeezed himself through the dog door and tumbled head first into the wet lawn. Shaking his head, he smiled and walked slowly over to the pool. He dipped a foot in cautiously, teetering from the change of balance. The water was cold, and dark and the ripples lapped softly away from him, into the darkness. He fell into that black pool, plunging deeper and deeper. The moon got smaller and smaller and he smiled as he silently closed his eyes. Deep inside the house, the babysitter looked up suddenly from her magazine. "Johnny?" She called with bored concern. "Johnny, I can't hear you playing mister!"Carnivalé   The roads of his small, peacefull town whispered quietly that fatefull evening Shadows danced in the flickering candlelight in the frosty windowsills The cobblestoned streets were dusted with dry, crackling leaves jittering across that one, lone night He couldn't sleep, so he crept to the window The shade pulled back just slightly, revealing a slice of crescent moon The moon shone down upon the street below, it's faint glow lighting the old, weathered stones Silently, he watched as they approached Dark, massive structures and cages being pulled on bumpy old wheels Men and women, silent and unrecognizable teetered and danced and trudged along They made no sounds, save for the squeaky patter of the old, painted wheels A lone man walked in front Broad, tall, strong and powerful His face a mess of shadows The little boy watched silently above as they trudged through the town The man stopped at the center of town, the procession behind him coming to an abrupt halt. The shadows swirled and danced His hand rose up to twirl at a black moustache His eyes flickered in the candlelight A hiss sounded from one of the covered cages A low growl sounded from another A woman began to sing softly From within a covered cage The hissing and growling ceased The man smiled, revealing a showstopping smile "Carnivalé "  He whispered, his accent deep and thick The candles flickered out The Carnivalé  had come to town.Dreamcatcher  She was falling Faster and faster Past blurred faces and claws and fire and screams Yet she sat there so calmly Not the least bit alarmed Somehow she knew Knew it was a dream Just a light figment, just something she would get out of Of course she was right And as she awoke from her slumber She smiled a cocky, I'm too rational for you kind of smile She rose from bed and stretched Yawned and put feet with floor The Devil stepped out of the shadows of her room A dream, he said with a quiet whisper You may realize this is a dream, his whisper getting louder But what you do not realize, his voice now booming off the walls Is that time is forever in my dreams, His laughter piercing her ears Slicing that coy smile clean off her faceHome  He sat that cold winter evening Back against a cold hard lamp post It's glow faint and seemingly far away His eyes looked out beyond an ancient furrow brow, seeing only cold swirling snow He sighed, a deep push of air that sent a white cloud spiriting away from him Larissa darlin, He said in a deep grieving voice Larissa, why'd you leave me here precious? A tear slid slowly down the face of a fresh mourner Mate gone, hopes and dreams with her The man, bent with age and sorrow curled into a ball Arms wrapped tight around his scuffed up pants A thin, wisp of a wind ruffled his hair Those ancient eyes looked up Back on Earth, an old woman, was alone in her home Mrs. Larissa Thompson sat in that lonely old house, grieving for her recently dead husband. Wesley She whispered timidly Pale thin hands wrapped up in one another Why'd you leave me here all alone? She shook and tears welled up in her eyes She swallowed, and the hands unwrapped themselves Reached under the bed, to where Wesley has kept the gun I'll be home soon Wesley She said in her quiet, but firm manner.Pale Assassin  His pale hands shook with cold and fear Trembling veins froze into tiny blue rivers His eyes shot through the heavy mist Making out a dark shadow of a man Coming towards him, knife in hand The old man stifled a scream and fell back into a black shadowed alley Falling onto cold wet pavement He looked up into the eyes of  his assassin Deliverance his pale lips trembled Deliverance is for cowards growled the murderer A silent scream filled the deep harbor docks that fateful evening As blood mixed with salt water The gas lamps flickered and purred with content.Wonderland  The sky twinkled overhead Sparkling little diamonds He plucked one gently from the heavens Smiled, and then smashed in to a pulverized mound. He looked upon the peaceful earth Sang to the people and the trees Then stomped and thrashed until all was still He then went back into his home and sat down quietly Opening his book he began to read Once upon a time there was a horrible ogre What a strange story he chuckled to himself....and popped a few children in the oven on broil.A little conversation in the life of highschoolers:  Diane:. . .hey greg, who helps you with eng. hw Greg: . . .hey diane, who helps u name ur story, makes the final climax of ur story, teaches you how to properly bruise hands, provides love for KC, and gives u emotional support?

One of the girls shouted and wiggled with joy The other sat sullen and brooding The marbles rolled Towards the angry girl Shaking little piles of glass The wiggler stopped and looked in shock How did you do that?  The wiggler asked quietly The girl gathered up the marbles and stood up silently Her shadow blocking all sunlight from the wiggling little girl I'm just special She said in a whisper And walked across the playgroundAll That We Live For  I was in the car One late winter night Highway lights Colors like shiny presents Blurred together in bright ribbons Mist fell deeply like snowflakes When I saw him there A young man, like all the others Homeless, just sitting on a bench Arms wrapped tight around himself Rags as clothes I sat in my car Heater blasting Radio on christmas songs I glanced over, as the bright lights caught my attention He and I looked at each other But unlike all the others  I didn't forget him Because he smiled And he meant it I smiled back, and we knew one another We were in the same place Just watching all the cars run past On their way to homes and loved ones I don't know why he mattered so much to me But that night I cried And my tears were for that man That had his arm wrapped around himself because he was so cold THis isnt a poem, a writing or even me trying to be creative It's me coming to the realization that we do live in Fairy Land And I guess this is just me being thankful SO thank you to my parents, my society and my friends And most of all thank you to that man WHo smiled at me like I was a real personLily's Lullaby- Part SEVEN  The next few days I spent engrossed in thought. I knew I had to get rid of them, but how? I sat pent up in my room- only telling the others slight information. They dismissed me as crazy and generally left me alone. Then one night it hit me. I watched as their torches came slowly over the horizon and I knew what I had to do. The Mayson residence was their safehouse, their haven. To get rid of their haven would be to get rid of them. It was dilapidated, dying already. It wouldn't be hard to burn the hell hole to the ground. I spent that evening looking down upon the monsters, smiling and waving sweetly at Lily who howled and leapt and clawed at the ground and walls. I spent that night anxiously waiting until they left, trudging back to the forest. I slipped out of the house, provisions in my cloak pockets, kicking aside their now dead amusement from hours before. My foot got caught in the man's jacket and I pulled sharply. Something caught my foot and I fell to the ground hard, hitting my head on a sharp stone. I became groggy and everything blurred. The last thing I remember seeing was the dead man's face, leering at me, putrid stale breath choking me slowly. It must of been much later that I woke up. My head throbbed and I could feel the dried cracked blood on the back of my neck. Why was I still alive? I thought desperately. And where was I? I tried to rise, and felt a reeling in my head, and a dull pain through my body. I sat into a fetal position and had a look at my surroundings. I was in some kind of a barn it looked. The room was small and dark, furnished with nothing but a cold stone floor, some dry pieces of hay and a shivering candle. The one lone door was heavy oak, and had been most likely locked. Sure enough, as I rose slowly and walked stiffly over to it, I was unable to open it. I looked over to the candle, and my first thought of burning the house down came to mind. Good idea Meredith, I muttered. Never smart to burn a house down while you're locked inside. I looked all around the room in vain, trying to find a means of escaping before my captors came back. I sat down against one of the cold slabs of wall and sighed. A beetle scuttled in front of me. I eyed it, and my mouth began to salivate. A hand shot of, crushing the beetle in it's grasp, juice oozed out of it's decaying palm. The hand rose to my mouth, and I realized it was own. I swallowed the beatle ravenously, smacking my lips. My mind began to work faster, the room began to spin. Click, click, click- little pictures of what had happened began to form in my mind. My body seperated from my mind, both reeling and lurching with new rythyms and motion. Inside I was screaming, outside I was a beast. They had blood- induced me, Lily herself smiling broadly eyes blank and round like those of a great white shark. She had taken me as her prize, her toy. I was half awake when she pulled me to her. Her body was dead and rotten, chunks of flesh had dropped off, leaving molding pieces of bones and muscles filled with maggots. She pulled my face to hers and kissed me lightly on the cheek, her lips dry and cracked with blood. I pulled at her hair and her face in vain attempts to get away, but she just laughed darkly as her cold hands gripped my tighter. Her lips left a trail down my cheek, towards my neck. I felt her sharp fangs plunge into a big, fat juicy vein and for a brief spasm I shook with pain. My body crumpled after that, and I fell asleep- only to be thrown into this cell. It was complete I thought bitterly, as I snapped out of my reverie. I sat there, calmly watching my body lurch and grovel around the small barn, reeling and banging itself against the walls. I wanted meat, and blood and pain. I wanted to cause pain, and feel hurt seep within my pores. I knew it wasnt right, but then a deep laughter filled the tiny room. Maniac laughter that sputtered and kicked and growled. I looked around the room in surprise, only to find the laughter coming from deep within my soul...The monster had been born.Her hands ran across the keys Pail long stems pattered on the ivory Slow and graceful, like waterdrops The notes sounded from inside of her She closed her eyes, her body swayed so slightly I watched her intently Hands gliding over the piano She smiled Her eyes opened The stems drooped The waterdrops stopped and ran still Water running along slowly upon ivory hills She turned her head towards me And at that moment I would have given to world To give her my sight And to let her see how beautiful her playing really was But she will never see For her life is shrouded in darkness She will never see How inspired we all are by herDown the hole she fell Spiraling and swooping deeper and deeper She began to slow The air now warm and soft What a wonderful way to die! She thought As she plunged through the center of the earthI've lost my mind many times, I've lost my wallet many more- KCEmotions hit like sledge blows Tears fall so easily when you're in love Pain is felt in each touch when you're alone Melody super imposed on skin That is what I view Your voice is a song to me A sweeping crescendo that makes my breath lift Your hands play an unspoken tribute to lovers all over the universe your eyes script life's climaxes And put them down on paper That is what I read  My heart is found in your lyrics My soul in your tune Thank you for living in my world That is why I love you.Ok, no offense to anyone who actually does read this, but I'm feeling quite frusturated.

Unreachable, just out of thought and conscience it dwells. For faith brings us upon the boundary of this unthinkable pleasure Makes us question who we are, what morals we live upon If longevity were to become obsolete, infinity would prosper What time would be treasured, what memories replenished At the end of the day- you have to ask yourself Would eternal youth really be a thing of beauty Or an afterthought that holds us in the prisons of our souls.Prodigy  and she dropped her paintbrush on the palet Blood-red paint spattering her shirt Like a horrible incident She leaned on the edge of her chair to admire her work She viewed her subject as it lay now decapitated on her bed Once a lover, now a forgotten enemy She smiled with grim satisfaction The pen is mightier than the sword  she sang in a light voice And swept out of the room to create more masterpiecesHe sat calmly Almost serenely I guess you could call it The radio drifted in through the window Lazy and slow But calm and happy The news blared from the living room Another dead, another murdered said the solemn anchor All the same, he murmured and shook his head Good thing I'm not like them, he smiled And Sat on the cold bathroom floor- razor slowly slicing away his life Blood pooled in puddles on hard marble A man lay dead- to be known on the six o'clock as another death People would shake their heads And listen with grim satisfaction Good thing I'm not like that, they'll nod to each other And go about their lives in a rapt ignorance that keeps us goingonce i remember a time when i cared when laughter mattered when you were a facet of me Once I think we even cared about each other Once I think we would hold each other and just smile Once, I think- but I could just be dreamingLeave me a comment kids and ....non kids tell me what you thinkOnce in a while The world will tilt upside down Just to see what it's like to smile againswim out past the breakers  watch the world end rolling sun lays in clouded sky smiles across the bend yeah the truth is I'm sicking of having to pretendand the people turned their skys to the heavens, as the clouds roared with fury and the sky snarled it's head in rage. Tremors shook the earth like a rag, violently and without shame. Deep cracks flew through the land, fire rose and destroyed all life within it's path. Icy tendrils ran rampant through the northen hempisphere, freezing and torturing and sealing off the innocent. Trees were tossed in waves of havic, animals burned, villages plundered. A silent scream silenced by a giant hand. An eerie death filled the smoke-raped land.

Perhaps indeed, I had been man for far to long to have any boy left in me. Cora was the same. Her small body was fragile, especially for a girl of 10, but when I looked closely I could see the old woman inside, gasping for breath and hunching over so many burdens and so many memories. Cora and I lived in such a different time then now. Our time was 100 years ago, 1850 back in Wyoming out on Poppa's farm. It had been a happy time, an era of wealth, prosperity and a myriad of friends and family. Cora and I were but young children, mere babes as I see it now. 10 and 12, Cora and I respectively had helped Poppa on the farm, doing chores, cooking and greeting the unending river of friends stopping by in rushes of hugs, warmth and fresh bread.  I still recall those days with a satirical laugh.  Such naivity and freshness we had exuded, Cora and I often lament, such easy prey we were.            I remember the day he came. "Tall man!" Cora had whispered in a awed, hushed voice and she darted into the barn. I was gathering Chicka's eggs and sat down on a bench and wiped my brow with a dirty hankerchief as I had seen Poppa done a thousand times before. "What's this about?" I asked solemnly. Cora had a way of creating myths and fabrications, and thus I was not alarmed. Her dark brown eyes opened wide and she tried to measure this man's length with her pale, slender arms. "Bigger than the horses!" She crowed, brown eyes dancing and sparkling. She danced around and twirled her arms, sending tumbles of dark black hair tumbling out of her bonnet. "Coraline Maria Solden!" I admonished loudly, standing up and knocking over my basket of eggs. I yelped as they tumbled out, rolling over the hay and across the dirt. Cora laughed and we both plopped down on the ground to start retrieving them. I crawled around on all fours and was just about to scoop up the last little white treasure when it was picked up for me. I remember his hands being the first thing I saw, and already I knew something was wrong. Long, pale, sharp fingers. Fingers the color of milk, unlike the tanned, calloused fingers I was used to seeing around the farm. They transformed into long arms, covered with a stiff black suit. So long, so lean and so wrong for our sunny, informal home. I rose slowly, letting my eyes soak in the abberation. "Here son, you dropped this," The voice was stiff, as though mechanic and not oiled properly. I took the egg from the outstretched fingers, careful not to touch them for fear of catching the length disease this man obviously had. I looked up and gazed at his face. Pale as his hands, if not paler. Wavy black hair, black as Cora's tied into a neat ponytail at the nape of his neck. Pale lips, thin and parted slightly to reveal two perfectly lined points of white soldiers ready to fight. A thin, slanted noise pointing down sharply, black eyes, blacker than coals or midnight. He rose to at least 6 feet 6 inches, from his black boots to his coarse, brown felt hat, maybe more, for as a child I was inept at measuring distances with my eyes. I muttered a weak thank you and fell back in line with Cora, who looked just as forlorn as I. My father stepped out from behind the man, wringing his hat and refusing to look either of us in the eye. "Kids," He said in a fallaciously cheery voice, "This is my....friend Lukander Voss" Poppa tried to meet my eyes but couldn't. "He's going to be...staying with us for a while- he has business in town." Cora and I exchanged furtive glances. Business in our town of 5,000 consisted of a new plow or buying live stock- neither of which Mr. Voss seemed familar with. Mr. Voss coughed uncomfortably and shifted his feet. His boots scraped on the dusty barn floor, sending up a cloud of dust. "Well, I'm very happy to be staying with you!" His voice was loud, and out of place. I looked over to see Cora wince slightly, my reaction as well. As he and Poppa stepped out into the sunlight, Cora and I sat down heavily, leaning against Chicka's pen walls. She led out a whoosh of air and I merely nodded. As we look back on these times of trivial youth, we become furious with our past selves for not beingmore aware of the ominous feelings we were both having.Prologue   "Cool night," I whispered to her, shaking sand from my hair. She was next to me, silent and noble as a cliffside and merely nodded. "Do you think they know?" I whispered quickly, almost frightened.  Her form moved slowly so I could see her whole face. She sank one hand into the cool, damp sand and began to sift it thoughtfully through her fingers. She gave me a comforting smile- always so affectionate. "No, my dear,"she said slowly, as though words were a burden, "They have no idea. Let us rest now." I turned my gaze away from her and back to the ocean. Vast and powerful, it raised its mighty fists and surged great white stallions ahead, careening them dangerously into the mountainside. So quiet, I thought, so quiet on such a painful night. I kicked off my scuffed shoes, tossing them towards a blanket we had set up, then forgotten. My feet wriggled into the cold mush of sea water and sand. She looked over, shot me a glance and opened her mouth as though to ridicule, but then closed it promptly. Her mouth made a loud popping noise as it closed and I giggled. She looked suprised, but then laughed faintly, turning back to watch the ocean. I leaned against my palms and began to rise. "Parker," She said softly, "Oh Parker, where are you going?" I stood up, brushing the sand from my faded trousers and shaking my limbs as a boy of 12 does. "Just to go feel the water, Cora" I said in an almost pleading voice. Cora's eyes turned upwards towards me. The moonlight lapped in those dark, serious pools, "Oh...please Parker, just stay with me and wait." Her small form pleaded silently with me.I sighed loudly, an exasperated sigh but a defeated on at that. I dropped to the ground, sending a spray of sand into the dark night.And I'm the kinda girl who doesn't take anything for granted And I'm the kinda girl who leaves a scar And I'm the kinda girl who wears black with white and doesn't leave you behind  My name is love My name is vengeance My name is the words that men utter right before they die  They call me killer They call me bitch They call me two minutes in the fast lane  Brown eyes Brown hair White skin  I am myselfAnd lately I'm been thinkin I don't give a shit Lately I havent found anything new to hit All of a sudden my world is black All of a sudden you've turned into an attack  When the world's colors drain away I'm just left livin in yesterday Trying to get to where I should be But what's really the point of dying to be free  Heavy black boots Used to walk all over people like me and you That's what they're given That's why my eyes can only see NightThere's a cure for you and me There's a little thing we never did see Deep inside each of us Is just a little bit of soul Worrying about everything will take it's toll  So my friend why do you worry About the constant scurry Life is full of it Can't you just take it all in turn Baby just watch the sun burn  A little sun and a little rain Take it all in place of pain The sun can cast a shadow But just take it as a pleasure Laying in shade is a happiness you can't measureTribute to My Ancestors  dirt land hit hard with triumph for we are the chosen neanderthals who toil under plastering sun for we are the endless ants that carry our burdens silently the soil may look plain to you But Oh! let it be heard and proclaimed It runs deep within our veins Like a river of wealth we feed from our own calloused hands Here is our oath to nature and to ourselves Let our forefathers remember a time of toil, heat and work a time of thanks and blessingFor we Are the Fortunate Few   sometimes my view of the world seems slightly askew Sometimes I see dreams float away When they should have never been lost Sometimes I watch men and women weep For companions that should not have died Sometimes I watch the news To forget about my happinessConstellation going up, let's forget about our problems, and baby we'll just run, just to watch the heavens and  have a little funPlayroom  A childhood dream manifested into plastic happiness A playroom built for these little darlings Feast upon their innocent minds A cube of color, sound and light Designed to enrich and love Their own little room  They whispered Pigtails bouncing, shoelaces tripping Bright chrome doorknob opens into the womb Inside their toys giggle and breathe The door clicks behind them Hard metal sliding into the lock They giggle and pretend as the lights turn off A silent hand takes their screams Their pasted smiles cut off As the darkness turns into a growl What was supposed to be a electronic mother A safe living quarter Decided not to let her children ever leave again Better they stay safe in the dark, still and quiet then have to brave the outside world Their parents lay sobbing on the outside Pounding on the metal walls Begging for their offspring But the circuits shook their head and tapped their foot No, no she crooned Their safe, and so so quiet now.Your Results: The top score on the list below represents the faith that Belief-O-Matic, in its less than infinite wisdom, thinks most closely matches your beliefs.

How do you describe torment to it's justice? How can you ever really capture security and the presence of instability? I want to share my story with you Will you listen to what I have to say More importantly, will you care The effect of myself on people is minimal If I were to never exist the world would still spin, the lottery would continue ripping people off and you would most likely still fail your math quiz tommorow So how do we know whether or not youre missing someone? How am I supposed to tell  the story of my life If I don't even know if it's the real version The fabric of life is full of wrinkles and holes Have I just slipped through? How am I supposed to relate to this world of complexity When I find myself searching for troubles of my own A story that has no beginning No middle And no end? So I sit here, friends and foes, without a means of retaliation All I know, is my hair is still tucked behind my ears, and my lip is still being bitten All I know is that I'm here, and my life is mine to ownTrying to breathe but finding it hard What's the point of crying out for help If no one cares enough to hear your call I'm slipping into point blank death A quiet time, a place for resti have wounds that never heal i have scars that go deeper than you can see i've endured hurt and  i've endured him i'm stronger than you know strong enough to let you see my scars strong enough to tell you who i amand here's a toast  to the mother fuckers who burned me into the ground i raise my glass and tip my hat to the knives that made me cry out loud so here's my salute i'm oh so  proud of all the pain i've endured if it werent for you and all you shit my past would still be blurredWell kids...I'm off to Maui for a week, so an extended absence is to be expected.

One more silen tear and another brave boy has died for his country.And I'm coming back Back to when I was much stronger than you I'm picking up slack And running towards Everything you though you could ignore I've become much stronger Through all the hits you've dealt I've picked up that extra adrenaline That you thought you bottled up and stored away Now I see your illusions Now I can see who you really are And as I'm running past you and yours I see only blurs As your try to reach out and stop me All you grab is air Thank you Thank you for making me realize That I am so much more than thishmmm a much needed re vamp of the blog always is refreshing, no?I'm just a girl Such a little, tiny girl Sitting on a park bench Wrapped up in dad's old Harvard Sweatshirt Eyes dropping tears onto the cement slab That I sit so quietly on Passerbys hurry past Eyes sliding from big department store to the next Not even noticing me Suddenly I'm in highschool Sitting at a desk, one of thirty five in a tiny classroom A teacher stands up front, eyes cold and hard Sliding from person to person Not even noticing me As I sit here with the same silent tears And the same old sweatshirt All my life I've just wanted to be noticed All my life I've just wanted to careI remember so distinctly being a scared, skinny twelve year old staring back at the dirty mirror in a Macy's dressing room. The glaring light beat down on my stringly hair and gawky limbs. I remember so clearly tugging at a pair of bell bottoms that were too big and not right and watching as a silent tear fell down my freckled cheek. You see, when you're little the world doesn't seem to care at all. I've grown up from that little girl into something more. Last night I sat cross- legged in front of my own mirror in designer jeans and a victoria secrets bra and pushed back a lock of hair. Biting my lip I came to realize that my body may have grown up, my hair may have become more stylish, and my friends increasingly more high profile and abundant, but I am still that little girl. To society I have always been an abberation. You've all tried to pin me down as one teenage experiment but I can't tell you the hours of self pity I have accumulated.I have popular friends, gorgeous amazing boyfriends, wonderful parents and a beautiful home but inside I still am deep within a dimly lit Macy's store, trying so hard to fit in and just be part of the teenage masses. I remember wearing those bell bottoms to the first day of sixth grade, so nervous and hoping just anyone would talk to me. I remember just as well going to first period and tripping in the door to have some 6th grade punk laugh at my shirt and pants and hair. I was gawky yes, but ironically the same boy commented on how pretty I was just last week. To all of you, I've grown into something pretty and funny and strong. TO me, I'm still stuck tugging at a poorly cut shirt and trying so desperately to figure out why you all laugh at me behind my back. When you're little, the world doesn't seem to care. When you're big, you come to the realization it just doesn't. So this is a story, a tale of a little girl who has grown into her body, but has yet to grow up.sitting here trying to figure out if you have a place for me i know it's strange for me to be here that i know you could have so much more i realize now how lucky i am i just want to be good for you  i just want to be good for you....shhhhh just for one night lets let the night slow down just for one fateful evening let me place my hand in yours as we watch the summer sun set quiet down and realize words arent needed as we walk together  as the world goes spinning by come rest your head on my shoulder and we can watch the fireflys wrap your arms around me and tell me you love me just as the moon rises into it's final resting spot the sun may be jealous, but the moon will be the final witness of our last days togetherFriends! He said so gallantly Hands sweeping up the air and turning it to gold Welcome to my Oasis! His teeth grinned and his eyes winked a cornflower blue They shuffled their feet uncomfortably and looked around Convicts, murderers and and rapists stood huddled in a group Scarred, tattoed, dirty bodies stood awkwardly in formation My brothers! He called out in his starched, tailored suit Do not fear, for I have  saved  you! His coal black shoes shone silently like two patient puppies Sitting by their master's sides The men relaxed a little, one tittered softly, another lightly chucked his neighbor's shoulder and they looked at their surroundings in awe Welcome! His voice softened and his brillant twinkling eyes danced Embrace your new home His tanned long fingers parted and raised towards the heavens The men by this time were laughing and smiling, one had taken off his cap and flung it gallantly into the air My father! Sang one of the men to all the others I see my faith in God has paid off! He crowed to a particularly violent serial killer next to him The man in front of them grew agitated at this outburst The shiny new shoes clicked and tapped on the ground You realize you're dead then, all of you He said, eyeing them cautiously This is most unfortunate... His hands wrung and twisted the beautifully crafted browned fingers The men slowed their dancing and came to a halt, once again in the awkward configuration that they had begun in A brave soul, a young rapist, stepped towards their savior eyes full of trust and hope We've come to serve God he said in a small voice I can speak for my brothers when I say we know we've made mistakes but... Silence! Savior's voice grew sharp and tense, cutting through his gold polished air and dulling the shine of his eyes As I said before, I've rescued you! He grew excited, hands twisted more, sweat appearing on his brow You will not have to have faith in God any longer my sons! For I am your new savior! The assasins, slayers, killers and pain inducers of the world began to tremble in fear Their spokeman, a young man who had silenced the woman who had said no, now walked towards Savior once again  Where are we father? He asked submissively, eyes downcast and cap in hands Savior's eyes flashed, now as jet as the tailored suit Well don't you know boys? His voice was no longer welcoming, but sarcastic and cruel Oasis, Oasis! He said, maniac laughter bouncing off the walls The young man tried once again Please, father- are we in limbo? Is our fate decided yet? His eyes seemed hopefull as though he thought he had a chance Father looked down upon the men and began to chuckle softly Your fate, little soldiers is already done His hands, long and tan pointed downwards From here, we only go down and down, deeper and deeper The men began to tremble, fear began to pump into their hearts His million dollar suit seemed to gleam importance Normally I don't come up here for just anyone, but for a group of men as important as yourselves... His smile grew large, his eyes grew a dull film over the brillance How silly of me, I have yet to fully introduce myself He stood tall and made a most gallant bow to his subjects I am The Devil, and this, gentlemen is Hell....enjoy your stay.What it is to cry what pains have we reached in our lives To show this brushing of weakness to the pillars of society That seem so strong and brutal They're made of stone and are never to be broken  What makes a weaker man weep upon his eminent death when fate has already played a steady hand Such a subtle way of expression such a gentle thrill released through sorrow Sorrow, oh what a fitting word to describe these tears sorrow has been a dark shadow, hidden but always in attendance To the men and women who are the supports and backbones of this society to the shoulders who have felt such a heavy burden to keep us all normal and unassuming Your tears are dammed, hushed and dried your tears are the water we use to quell our starving minds a silent toast, watch as we raise our glasses to you, my silent friend who writhes in unvoiced agony a toast to your pain, a toast to our gaini've got too much life runnin in my veins going to waste won't you take some of this take a little time out of that plastic life cut me up and leave me broken take a piece of me home and at least love some of me i've got too much life runnin in my viens won't you take that blackened knife you call affection and slice through my heart black and cold as your weapon of choiceCant think of a title- something like "dr. seuss on depressants?"  something from deep inside my head fills my heart with a resonating dread whispered rumors form into whispered tales they take shape and substance and float upon gales softly they drop atop my shoulder tiny but deadly, as they sit each a boulder their songs lick my ears and prob in my morals the yarns tell of stories, of old and new quarells they leave my heart blackened, my soul feeling week for they have left our outcome love, as very near bleakThis is to be the last post on my blog before I leave...I'll be gone for two months give or take some breaks so try not to die without me people ::insert hysterical laugh here:: and all i have to say today is: stare out at the stars  BREAK... this is jessie muahaha i dont know who all reads this but diane is awesome and her and greg and i are all eating really good brownies, harlem shaking (actually jsut greg) and chillin like villians....welp here is back to dianes ranting readdddddddddy???

Posted by  urlLink HelloOk so since I obviously am addicted to the computer I might as well make this my daily rantings too. Sister left today and for those of you who don't know her (be thankful). Valedictorian, graduated Stanford in three years and now anal as hell. So my foil and my foe is related to me- ironic. Luckily she's 9 years older (big age difference because I was adopted) and is the homeowner of some overly expensive apartment in San Fran with her husband who is brain blessed as well. As my parents and sister left for "quality bonding time" I decided to fake a headache and procrastinate packing. I leave for Kansas tomorrow, you know that state that's flat and Dorothy rocks out with that little dog, Frodo or Kiki or something. I'm going to visit relatives, which will actually be fun because I'm sandwiched in age between my two closest cousins- cool cats all around.

Posted by  urlLink HelloIn life I feel like sometimes letting go Like sitting on the edge of a bridge, looking out onto a river Those men you see on TV who sit there sobbing Hope already down in the raging water below You see them shaking and feel a fleeting glimpse of compassion for them But I I relate to these men sometimes In life It's those cold autumn nights that leave you lost Sitting in a window seat blowing hot air onto frosted panes Look out and notice me In life It's just become easier and easier to sit down and bow your head Fingers clasped and eyes shut In life It's become simpler to use a excuse to come go home rather than to live under the stars In life, the world has been turned inside out, enveloping us allOut upon the evening sky Lay spread a tangible faith Lept among the stars it purrs A divine intuition too great to grasp  Here a mind lay in it's deepest recesses Poured from the blackest midnight Stolen from the pools of the deranged A horrific speculation too horrible to convey  As fog lifts its veil, her eyes are shown Look, they murmur, how her beauty does glow Like the brillant sky, her charm is unsung Her eyes, they whisper in hushed tones, are as raven as the night  But what they fail to see comrades Is the vacancy from within For deep within this hallowed place Lays a writing, wickled, screaming faceurlLink    Annika I warned you....Kids don't do this at home (or at least don't take pictures)  Posted by  urlLink HellourlLink    Dark....a lot like my sense of humor  Posted by  urlLink HelloSo I've decided after that mad blast of pictures....that this blog will not only be Diane poem land but Diane picture land as well....deal with it :)urlLink    Yes, the arrow is pointing the correct way  Posted by  urlLink HellourlLink    Not saying WHO that is....but it's definetly a shirt worthy of owning wouldn't you say?  Posted by  urlLink HelloI've posted a new test on my AIM profile...you can now discover your alcoholic personality!  Take the test and let us all know by posting your results in the comments section of this blog!  I am a MARTINI, described as follows:  Rich, and refined you're smooth and saucy. You're the butter on the bread, the lube on the hinge, the teflon on the pan.   How about the rest of you?  Let's hear it!Happy Turkey Day, boys and girls!    There's nothing like heading home for a holiday in anticipation of being reminded about how dysfunctional your family really is.  Don't get me wrong, now, I absolutely love my family (and the fact that we are dysfunctional is actually quite comforting bc I fit in so well)  In any case, I'd like to share with you all this evening the top five family stories (cliff's notes versions, of course) about my family.  As a sidenote, I often refer to my mother and father as Sue and Larry, so keep that in mind as you read on to avoid confusion!  Number 5, The tailgating and chugging of Smirnoff story in which Sue and Larry so affectionately offer to buy beer for us in fear that we won't have enough.  Direct quote from Sue, "What number is that, Al?"  Al: "It's only 3 mom"  Sue: "Well, you better get to work, kid, you have to have at least 5 or 6 more before you hit the stadium."  In "chimes" (get it?) Larry: "You need anything kids?  Beer, money for beer, anything at all?"  Imagine the blank stares of the LSU tailgaters at first interaction with the parents of yours truly  Number 4, The my dad will wear the ugliest shirts ever sewn together as long as they have pockets and this saved him from being stranded on the interstate story.  As stated above, the man has to have a pocket on his shirt.  If there is no pocket, he will bluntly tell you that you have wasted your time and money and he is unhappy with your selection.  No matter how ugly the shirt is, if it has a pocket, Larry will love it.  He gets stranded on the interstate one day (a car he was working on broke down) and a friend of his saw him and stopped to offer him a lift.  Says the friend to Larry, "I looked up as I passed you and I thought to myself, that has to be Larry, because nobody else in the world would wear a shirt that is that ugly."    Number 3, The my niece is just as outspoken as her mother and her aunt put together and this got us into an interesting situation at a Chinese restaurant story.  Here we are at China Jade enjoying dinner, when our waitress (who, by the way, has an extremely short haircut) walks up to ask if we need anything else.  My niece, Emily, chooses to ask her, "Are you a boy or a girl?"  For those who have met the mother of Emily, my beloved sister, Christine, you understand where she gets her big mouth from I am sure.  Number 2, The my other sister has no common sense and asks a very very stupid question on the day of my 21st bday about my new and still healing tattoo story.  This requires very little more than her question, "Why did you get a frog that has blood on it tattooed to your back?"  WOW....  Number 1, The my mom was never really much of an English person and this proves it story.  This occurred at the time when Lord of the Rings was first in the movie theatres.  Sue: "I'd like to see that new movie, isn't it about those boys who get stranded in the woods and that one kid can make a fire with his glasses?"  Al (banging head against the wall): "No, mom, that was Lord of the Flies"  Well, there it is...5 of the many many I could share...so how about some comments?  Post one of your stories about your own families, or for those who have spent some time with my family (I apologize) let us know your story about that experience!  Have a great holiday weekend!OK then, let's talk about the penis...  Well, it's not what you expected to see as the opening line of this post, much as it was not what I expected to hear as a transition into tale number three of Delany's "Tales of Neveryon" (a book that I am "reading" for an English class).  Nonetheless, I had to suffer through it, and as they say...misery loves company.  Ahh, the infamous "they" always causing trouble...have you ever imagined a world without "they" or "them" who would we blame things on?  "Oh, well they told me to do it that way"  Who would we use as a scapegoat when we didn't know the answers?  "Well, they should have that info for you very soon"  It would be a different world, indeed.  Now, back to English class (try to follow the bouncing ball)....this teacher of mine is a crackhead.  He characterizes himself with these funny looking hats and always relates whatever we read back to sex, orgasms, or male anatomy.  You should see my notebook.  So, in keeping with the traditions of this Tues/Thurs class, we will now have a Freedman Quote of the Week...today's is (drumroll please) "This guy was a renowned writer, so renowned, he got more pussy than Frank Sinatra"  Yes, that is right, he actually said that in class and I actually wrote it in my notes...LSU is indeed a fine institution of higher learning.  Today, we were even entitled to a little joke...transition into the joke from Freedman was..."Oh, I'd like to share my favorite sex change joke with you all."  (Apparently, he has many from which to choose.)  So it goes: Person asking about sex change:  Did it hurt when they cut off your penis? Person who underwent sex change: Not at all. Person asking about sex change:  Did it hurt to have to grow breasts? Person who underwent sex change: Not at all. Person asking about sex change:  Did anything hurt? Person who underwent sex change:  Well, just one thing... Person asking about sex change:  Well, what's that? Person who underwent sex change:  It hurt when they cut my salary in half.    As a "mild" feminist, I can see the humor and hear the truth of past inevitable discrimination, but I can also see the ignorance in making a joke like this one that undermines the value and capability of women.  Leads me to a little saying I like...For most of history, Anonymous was a woman.  Any one want to make a comment on that one?  Feel free.  Moving on, I just came from my Best Buy training, where I got to watch some team building videos and take a tour of the store I now call home.  It was all very fascinating, a lot to learn, but looks fun nonetheless.  I saw Dan the man from CKI leaving as I was coming in, apparently he too is jumping on the BB Bandwagon...I am such the trendsetter (shut up Adam, it doesn't matter that you worked there first)  :)  Well, that about does it for me and my randomness for the day.  If you made it to the end, congratulations!  You probably will be rewarded with a headache for your efforts!  Leave me some comments (props to Bobby for helping me set that up and to Kevin for sending a comment to prove that it works!)    Til next time, remember that Reese's may be ok, but if you are what you eat, should I be concerned that my roommate is obsessed with Trix?I've never really been a sucker for peer pressure, but I guess that since everyone else had a blog, it was only a matter of time before I got one too (besides, I was running out of jokes about them, so if you can't beat 'em...join 'em, huh?)  So it's Monday of Thanksgiving week...it hasn't really occurred to me just yet that Thanksgiving really is this week.  That's what you get for burning yourself out with other things I suppose.  But, as the end of the semester approaches, so does the fun!  I got a holiday job at the Best Buy in BR...I'll be working with one of the funniest guys around, Mr. Adam Wilson (did you know that I know two AW's?  small world)  I'm looking forward to training tomorrow for this little gig and seeing how it all works out.  Anyway, in case you haven't noticed, I tend to be a talker and I like to ramble...so there's never any telling what you may end up reading on these pages.  I tend to be pretty honest about things as well, so there's your heads-up gang!  I'm sure that a lot of what will be here will pertain to CKI as most of the readers will be CKI'ers, so should you find your name here, remember that I only bitch about those that I love, and I only yell at those I love very very dearly!  Let the good times roll....Wow, I am a slacker!!  Time for some catch-up.  Seems that everyone had a great time last Friday night, other than the vomit and the fact that Bobby refuses to accept that he is now my understudy, that is.  All in good fun, I am glad so many of us got together, I would say we should do it more often, but some of you are organ donors, so your liver shouldn't be so abused.  The Saints game Sunday was also incredibly fun, I loved the Explorer cramming, and since I drive an Explorer myself, I now know the limits!!  This week LSU had a blood drive and jambalaya sale outside of Best Buy...here's a little hint for everyone, if you decide to stop going to work and then go to former place of employment to collect blood and sell jambalaya, be sure that you have a secure hiding spot for when your old boss comes out to give blood...thanks to everyone who came out to help, it was very successful and we had a good time...but only here in Louisiana could you have a Decemeber blood drive and go home with a sunburn.  And the line dancing to Footloose was pretty fun, I think that we drew a little attention to ourselves with that one.  Funny story about the Blood Drive, there were two Kiwanians there and they had a glass of champagne, they offered me some, and (here's the funny part) I said no because I was at an official CKI event and was not allowed to consume alcohol.  Have you ever heard of such a thing?  Well that about takes everything up to speed, quit the job, collected blood, turned down alcohol, oh and I spent some time with my family last weekend as well.  Here's the Sue and Larry story of the week: Driving in the car with Sue and Larry (aka mom and dad) and Larry says the word "retarded" Sue:  Don't say that around Emily (4 year old niece) Larry: Why not, she's gonna learn it anyway...I mean, you did, didn't you? I love that guy!  Happy Holidays everyone!So it's Wednesday which means it's almost Friday!!  For those who don't know, we are going out on Friday night.  The plan is to meet at the Boot uptown on Broadway for 7pm and then head to Vera Cruz on Maple for 8pm and then barhop.  Gimme a ring or send me a line if you wanna join the fun!  After all, what good is sitting alone in your room?  Come hear the music play....Life is a cabaret, old chum...come to the cabaret!   I love Broadway...enjoy the rest of the week!Well, day one of finals is over for me, and I get a little break until the next one.  It's going to be a busy week with one of my best friends from high school getting married on Sat in New Orleans.  Since I am standing in her wedding, I have to drive home Thursday for the rehearsal (picking my dress up on the way) and then drive back to LSU Friday to take a final, then back home Friday afternoon to party and then the wedding is Sat night.  That makes me tired just thinking about it!  She did have one hell of a bachelorette party last weekend, though.  We rode out to Bourbon in an Excursion limo...seriously pimping with lava lamps and strobe lights and all kinds of other neat shit that amaze you when you are drunk.  We met some fun guys who were from New Zealand and Australlia (I am such a sucker for an accent)  And, it was my first time at Pat O's and I loved it!    I am getting excited about my winter travels in January to Denver and then Michigan, and I am starting to not like my job at Best Buy quite as much as I thought I would.  Let's recap the events of Best Buy so far....I had a man tell me I didn't know anything about video games because I am a girl, I had my car broken into, I had to take out the garbage (yes, this is a serious problem for me), oh yeah, and there's that whole thing with the place being REALLY LOUD ALL THE TIME!  But, I'm trying to stick it out a little more to get some extra cash for my trips.  Well, since I know this is officially the most boring thing I have ever written, I think I will stop now.  Oh, update on Friday....it's looking like we will be swinging uptown after dinner.  Start thinking about what clubs you'd like to hit and start spreading the word...we're getting close now!  Can't wait to see you all then!urlLink        You Are An Intense Kisser!  Deep tounging, nibbling, and locking lips for hours are on your agenda.  You've been known to wear lovers out with your kiss,  before getting to anything else on the menu.  And given that you kiss so well... imagine how you do everything else.     urlLink   How Do *You* Kiss?       urlLink More Great Quizzes from Quiz DivaRandom thought: If assholes could fly, this place would be an airport.  Happy Sunday everyone and welcome to finals week, otherwise known as the week from hell.  So as not to dwell on the negative, let's get an update about next Friday night's plans.  The current rankings of our destination are as follows:  37 % for Screw this bullshit, let`s just get shitfaced!! 18 % for Dinner, then Bourbon Street 18 % for Dinner, then Rock `n Bowl on Carrolton to see the Molly Ringwald`s and drink, dance, etc 12 % for Dinner, then Rock `n Bowl, then Uptown 12 % for Dinner, then the Uptown scene (ie, Waldo`s, the Boot, etc)  So the way it's looking is we are either going to Bourbon or we are going to see a band.  If you haven't yet voted, you must do so before Tuesday so we can finalize the plans.  The poll will be cut off at 8pm.   When that poll is over, we will have a new one to decide our dinner destination.  Requests have included Houstons and Bravo on St. Charles.  You are all welcome to make a request and it will be included on the poll.  This will be decided by Wed at 8pm.  Don't you just love democracy?    And finally, who the hell is planning to go to this little event?  If you are definitely in, let me know so I can start to get an idea about how many of you I will have to deal with (ie, how much I will have to drink)  Just kidding, I love you all and hope that you can make it to party with me!!!!  Good luck with getting through the week and I'll be in touch about our adventures!Freedman quote of the day: As we had a discussion about how the author of the novel we are currently reading also writes porn, Freedman goes on a tangent to say, "This reminds me of a poem by a man named Alan Dicky" (oh the humor of a good pun)  So it's crunch time and everyone is busy studying for finals and getting drunk inbetween.  This will be a short post bc I quite frankly cannot think of a single interesting thing to write about.  I mean, there was that midnight trip to Morgan City last weekend, followed by that midnight trip to Lafayette...quote of the weekend goes to Andy McDonald..."Wow, girls, we haven't hung out in so long and now we are all sleeping together!"  Just use your imagination....  Update on Dec 13th party time!  I have created a poll on my AIM profile to see what you all would like to do that evening.  I have consulted my committee (ie, Beth) and we decided that we would stick with having dinner somewhere on St. Charles...probably Houston's or Bravo or something.  If you have a suggestion, let me know via the comment link or in an email.  I think the tour idea has fallen through, it would be an extra amount of money on top of dinner, but if anyone is interested in doing it another time, let me know.  I did it once before and I just find it really fascinating.  Ok, options:  Uptown bars, Downtown bars, the Quarter, Rock and Bowl to see the Molly Ringwald's perform (80's cover band)  no, we will not be bowling, they have tables and a bar and a dance floor.  Should we choose the band, we could also leave there and go uptown if we wanted to.  That is, if you guys can hang with your one and only "district drunk".  Take the poll or just let me know via comments or email (is this redundant yet?)  What can I say, I believe in democracy and I want us all to have a great time!  Well, that is all from me...good luck with your finals...and in the words of Socrates (thanks, Jeff) "I got the bottle, you got the cup, c'mon everybody, let's get fucked up!"Well, it's Tuesday and that means it's time for another Freedman quote of the day...and for today, it is this: "The penis is big, it's there, and it's fun, but the clitoris is so small, I mean, many men can't even find the thing most of the time." For those interested in getting the course info for this one, jot me a line and I will fill you in  Moving on.... I've decided that the leaderhip of LSU CKI can best be put to use in word problems for a fifth or sixth grade student.  It would read something like this: If you start with 5 board members and 6 committee chairs, and 3 board members quit, allowing 2 committee chairs to move up to the board, and 2 more committee chairs quit, leaving 2 club members to move to the steering committee, and then one of those 2 quits, leaving another club member to move up...what percentage of the original leadership is still intact?  Or maybe the real question is, what affect does this have on the potential leadership within the club?    Let's face it, with all this shuffling, the members of the club are losing faith in those that are responsible for running the club, and so those in the club with the potential to be great leaders are shrugging off that calling because of the instability of the way in which our organization has been run.  For the sake of all parties involved and interested, I would like to borrow some simple suggestions posted by Bobby Schroeder on his blog last night.  Apparently, there are several clubs in the district who are having problems lately, and I think Bobby is on to something.  They are as follows:  1) Leaders should listen to the opinions of others, and take advice when offered. They should make their own decisions, but at least get input from others. If 90 percent of the members hate 100 percent of the decisions, then something is wrong.  2) Leaders should go to as much training as possible, and read the few intelligent and simple damn rules we have. Such as, you have to be enrolled to be a member. Seems simple enough, but I guess it is not.  3) People need to realize that CKI is not the be all and end all of one's life. Clubs should be happy that people are members at all, should not take them for granted, and should appreciate them for the time they CAN commit. This is CKI, not Greek Life, where you get fined if you miss stuff. That ain't our thing, baby!  4) What has happened to interclubbing? What ever happened to a bunch of people jamming in a car, driving 150 miles on a Saturday morning, doing an all day service project, then getting dinner at Wendy's, going to someone's house, and getting as drunk as possible? I learned at least 20 times as much about CKI, and the people who are in it, at parties, football games, and the like as compared to stuffy meetings. I am telling you, the board that drinks together stays together! And that goes for clubs, members, etc. Some of my best memories are Xmas parties that Charles threw, going to LSU football games and drinking with CKI people but it was not a CKI event, going to parties after dances, projects, and open houses, and all that stuff. Why are we so friggin scared of post parties and alcohol? That is the best way to get to know people. You don't have to drink, you don't have to go, but for goodness sakes, don't prevent others from doing that if they want to.   With that said, I would also like to post an invitation to do some of that fellowship-ing that we all love so much to celebrate the end of another semester.  On December 13, in New Orleans, I am thinking one of two things.  The first is to do dinner and then go to the quarter and get shit-faced (I can see the surprise since everyone in this district apparently thinks that I am an alcoholic)  The second option is to do dinner and then take the New Orleans Haunted History Tour through the quarter...I think this would be something kinda neat and different to do on Friday the 13th (see the element of spookiness there??)  In any case, send me a comment or an email if you are interested and let me know which option you like better.  Of course, if we do the tour, we will have time to get shit-faced after, so don't worry about that.  Hope to hear from some of you soon and good luck with your finals!Hello hello hello again. It's lovely to speak to you all. Really. Let's see... seeing as my mother is off at work for another 40 million hours and I have neither A) a license or B) a car (though I have a permit and could easily drive anywhere I wanted to had I my Jeep), I am inherently under house arrest.  'Oh,' you say, 'But it's such a lovely day outside! Why don't you take the dog for a walk, or go for a bike ride, or read a book in the sun?' Well, first off, I will not be taking anyone for a walk because I am just now regaining said gift of movement back myself. Yes, I have begun training for cross country, and it  hurts . Secondly, my dog is quite content to nap, and continue on in a napping way until about 6 o'clock when he will undoubtedly begin to go mad with hunger. Yes, I starve my dog. He never eats. He is bone thin, and can barely survive on the bits and scraps from the garbage left over from the feast last night.  Actually, he is getting rather portly.  We feed him the same two meals a day, it's just that he hasn't gone for any walkies in a bit. I should go throw the ball for him outside. But not now, he's napping. And besides, that much physical exertion after a long and strenuous day of, err, doing stuff, might just kill me. And I have practice tomorrow. Need to preserve my energy, I do. Of course, the scheduled practice was to go swimming. Well, coach calls it swimming, it's really treading water for forty minutes. But it  is  much more fun than drills and sprints, or even a long run. No, though. We can't go swimming. The swimmers are going swimming. Wait a bit, it's not even the swim team. It's... the children! Little children who are afraid of the water and cling to their mother's legs before getting thrown into their cold, wet, doom, only to be met by some overly-perky girl with a long blonde ponytail, enthusiastically encouraging the little kids who are innocently flailing their arms about to "relax... be one with the water... and blow little bubbles... and..." So, while some children will become forever aqua-phobic, I and my fellow cross country runners will succumb to the pain and torture that is... the DP weight room. Again, actually not as bad as some workouts. It's just that, well, we did it on Tuesday. And it hurt. A lot. And it smells. A lot. And swimming is just way more fun. Ah well. C'est la vie.  Friday's workout is going to kill me. Sprints. I hate sprints. Sprints are the reason (besides wanting to devote my precious time to the beautiful art that is theatre) I quit track. And not only are we doing sprints, oh no, we are doing sprints  on the BEACH!  Ooh, it just keeps getting better. (Dear reader, you must know that, while I do seem rather sarcastic and cynical, I really do love cross country. Besides the pain, it's a fantastically fab group of people. It's just that it's very easy to complain about. Not that anyone reads this... but I digress). Yes, so, anyway... ah yes. And, on Saturday, whilst everyone is dragging themselves up Gaviota Peak, I, in my Jeep, will be happily driving around in Los Angeles, shopping for back-to-school supplies, writing (in Italian) to  Sig. Cicale  back in Prague (or are they in Italy now?), and maybe taking in a nice leisurely bike ride around the lake.  Oh, and shopping for something to give to Ariel for her grand birthday spectacular that I know she will have in a few weeks. I feel like an old lady around all my DP frieds. Well, all my freshman friends anyway. I was just at Karisa's for her 15th birthday, and Whitney hit 15 in March, Ariel will be on the 16th of August, and Molly - not until January  of next year!  However,  I  shall be happily celebrating my Sweet 16 come November.  A round of huzzahs!, if you will. Well, I suppose I must be going now. I've loads of important people to see and many things that need tending to. Perhaps we shall chat again sometime soon? Baci, ~KSo hello.  I've become so fed up with my other blog that I just need to start a new one. I've littered the other with stupid quizzes and mindless babble. So here I am.  I've not much to say right now, but I just can't leave a brand new blog naked, so I thought I'd post a quick note.  That being done, I shall leave you now. Tata. -KOK here goes nothing, I'm starting over. My old online journal is no more, I have a new address, I'll ahve a new look, more links, a profile, pictures and all that lovely stuff not to mention a knew look on myself. Ok so this is how I'm going to start out, so far this is my first year of High School at Abe. It's great minus a bitchy drama teacher. I have found a new guy to call my own, almost and this time he doesnt live in a different provence. Exsept I'm not sure how its working out, sometimes i love to think hes totally in love with me, but something show otherwise. Jared seems to be now out of the picture. Hes off girl searching and he already has two trying to go after him. I think he's overly enjoying it but hey, its not my job to judge, its his life. Jon's girlfriend Kristen haha.. she kissed him yesterday and hes overly happy which is great, Jon needs to be happy and someone to look forward to seeing. I guess its the same with Jared although, he seems content with or without someone. Danielle, my best friend, well she has had guys all over her as well and now is dating a guy named Jeremy and she seems exsteamly happy which is great. Me as a whole I've been bored as hell. The phone never rings for me, the guy i like is too busy and has let me down more then once, I get my homework done in hours my tests are going great I love my english class. I have no one to call and well... thats it. Everyday I have no choice but to sit around and think, usually I'm fine with that, but I dont have anything to think aobut anymore. I just can sit staring at the wall untill its like 9 or 10 so i can go watch a good tv show. This week I dont have much planned as of yet. I have a band consert and that should be good and its my first real consert for choir as well. Also mom asked me to go to work with her on the 5th for a take ur childern to work day but... she told me that i shouldn't go because it would be a waste of my day. which is almost a laugh .. lol cause i have nothing to waste. next semester im going to be so busy tho so i guess i shouldnt complain ... this is my break.. so i dunno.. i hope i do ok.... anyway i guess thats it.. so goodnite everyone  MOOD: Bored...   MUSIC: Staind - So Far AwayCATCH UP TIME   OK! well, the last few days have been lightly more interesting then before. I'm starting to read To Kill A Mockingbird in English which is cool, cause I've heard its a good book, of course others hate it, but oh well it gives me something to do.   The guy I liked he well, told me not to call him anymore. Thats the last I've heard from him and really, I'm ok with it, I had a feeling it was going no where and I heard he likes some other chick so I'm fine.   I went to the dentist yesterday, I found out in december they are going to put me to sleep cut my gums open chop my wisdom teeth into 3 bits and then pull it out peice my peice.. to all four of them.. so naturally i'm... scared to death!!! .  On a lighter note, lets see, miss oboe lady, the one that stalks me and is into everything that i am, and does better then me in everything and talks to much and is really ugly, WELL it turns out i kick her ass in singing... which is of course no doubt, but FINALLY the drama teacher put her down for once and not me and it was sweet revenge... and I was happy. I also got a 90 on my poem i presented and im awesome.  As for my music.. GOOD all GOOD ... umm I got Jared ( my ex)'s birthday gift ... and its music notes for piano guitar and vocal so im soo happy... I'll be playing it forever... and so far that is it for my life....   so I will let u guys know anything else interesting that turns up in my life....   MOOD:  Content   Song:  Still Staind :P - So far awayACHIEVEMENT?   Ok so my goal was to stay alone today, take a book and think, relax, avoide all human contact. Well I woke up this morning, go everything ready, made sure I had my new book "About the Author", My song writing book and my cd's. So i walk down to the bus stop alittle later so i would miss the early 20, because i know for a fact Danielle takes that bus.  (ps: Aside from my hate for most of my friends at this point I am also very mad at Danielle for yelling at me last night, on how i told Fred (her ex) she had a new bf.. which i dont even recall anyway) I'm almost at the lights where i cross the street to the stop and the 20 roles on by.. being the smart one that i am i dont run to the bus knowing there will be a 73 coming down the same way that takes me to the same stop in about ten minutes.  I slowly trudge along, but when i get to the lights, i notice, Danielle had gotten off the 20... that right she got right off of it   "WHY?"   I'm asking my self as i mouth the word "shit" I cross the street and go up to tlak to her.. it turns out she saw me walking and got off... just to talk to me... and tell me how sorry she is for being a bitch yesterday...  haha if only she could say shes sorry for being a bitch everyday ...  anyway so i said .. ok cool... disappointed that my days goal was totally over at that minute. eventually she asked me what was up.. i told her i've been going throughs tuff and i didnt want to talk about it .. and i was mostly tired i know she knew i was lying but oh well i dont care... so once again ... danielle starts talking about her life, and her new bf... and how all this stuff is wrong with her and thats why she spazed at me... and eventually she ran out of things to say.. and we were quiet ... i walked in the school and she followed me everywhere i went, so my idea for a nice quiet break in the morning was canceled as well.... so i did the smart thing.. i sat down next to fred in the caf... knowing danielle would talk to him.. he was also with steve and stef so i chilled out in my own little world while they talked... adding small... smart comments along the way..  then the bell rang we all went our seperate ways and i was happy.... everything else was good until lunch THE ONE TIME i NEEDED to get away. so i grabbed my lunch sat downstairs and ate.. low and behold... Katyrna, Danielle, Steph and  a few other people come sit down right next to me and start talking.... so i just sat there and ate quietly.. i had my discman on and ignored all of them... then when no one was paying attention i got up and walked away.... i went up stairs.. got out my book and ... 2 minutes later ... steph sat down next to me.... she asked me if i was ok because danielle told her i was "depressed" I hate that word anyway so ... she sat down next to me and i told her to define depressed.. and she couldnt so i said im fine just tired.. she asked me  if i wanted to be left alone... i would of said ya .. but i gave her the option... all she wanted to do was write a note... to her seceret lover.. so we sat together i read and listened to music.... steph wrote.. it was relaxing.. and that was my lunch.. it felt good... im just curious if its an accplishment or not....   after school i was hoping to get straight out of there .. but danielle caught me at my locker and took the bus with me home.. ugg.....   *sigh*  just one more day of the week Kris.... just one more day....

I went to starbucks... and talked to a lady, for an hour and a hlaf, about life, and books, and people, interests, travel... it was cool but god i need a GUY that is that.. i just need someone.. im going insain... its like in really cheesy movies where u look everywhere and someone is in love..... the only thing i really have ... to charish right now is my cd player and my music..  so life and times of what NOTHING... a boring ... life....  I dunno... mom is suddenly being nicer... homework is easy, no guy to call my own  the one mysterious guy i DO like (who isnt Jared btw) well... there are some ... technical difficulties there......   SOMEONE SAVE ME  Music: Breathing - Lifehouse            Numb - Linkin Park  Mood: DEATHENING BOREDUMSURPRISE!   Ok, I said i would keep you posted... it turns out Jared was refering to the past... before when I had to choose between Jon and Jared SO everythings good.  Ok now for the surprise... You know how i was desperatly waiting for someone great to sit beside me and try and get to know me... a few days ago that happened.. and A guy too Yet he never sat next to me.. while i was avoiding my friends... Anyway he told me he liked me...  The only problem this is one of my friends bfs... but that friend is also one of the many few i have a grudge on..  Ok so during these past few days I've been talking to him, calling him and such .. and hes not happy being with his gf at all .. so he wants to dump her but doesnt want her to be depressy ... but.. id unno the thing is...  this guy asked me out on friday and i dunno what to do.... im afraid he'll stop liking me and all will come to an end and ill be on the waiting list of nothing all over again... i dunno thats all that is new so far...   So i will now refer to this guy as  Mr. X  .. untill i think its safe to reveal who it is... and  Miss X  will be my friend....    MOOD: Scared, Happy, Slightly Hyper, Kinda Cold, thats it..  Song: Jacks Obsession - Nightmare before Christmas..   PS! I talked to Jon last night and I really wish he was here.. i wanna go out with him!!... I'd drop Mr. X as quick as i could... if I could have Jon lol... sorry anyway   GOODNITE!Here is the deal...   Ok friday my new friend Jenna, came to school after being sick for awhile so I had a real reason to ditch Danielle and Kat for a good reason, with someone knew to hang out with ... so Friday was great.. I also got to school early and I got to spend basically all morning alone reading.. Until Fred joined me for a little conversation..  This morning.. I woke up to the phone ringing... of course im not one to get up and answer it knowing its most likely for my brother.. but a minute later my brother knocks on my door, grabs my phone, gives it to me and says its danielle i think, shes crying.....  of course i grunted and answered the phone and asked her what was up she was upset because Jeremy and her had gotten in a fight, and she had just thrown up and she had to go to work in an hour and her mom didnt believe her that she was sick and .. made her go.. so she was crying and... i didnt care.. as much as it must be painful for her...  as little as it seems... i've done it.... oh well .. its her life not mine.. i just wish she would keep me out of it...  OK so most of the rest of the day .. i spent dragging my ass around.. I actually had a good conversation with my mom about school and driving and life and such... and well .. thats about it...  well aside from jared .... actually talking to me today  i was watching a movie and i had come back to a message from jared telling me to go to his journal page... so im like... ok ..  this is what he wrote... well the important stuff .. considering Jon and I and Jared and the situation..  It all started back in the day with Kristen Loader, who I will from this point forth call Krissie, to avoid getting her confused with Kristen Sigmeth, who will be known as Kristen. Krissie and I had our share of troubles, as most  couples  do, but we always had a way of handling them. But Mr. Jon over here seemed to think he needed to help us with our problems and then suddenly he was involed.  Now what I'm upset about is that Jon always feels he needs to be helping Krissie, or Krissie and me as a whole, whichever the case may be. He doesn't need to be helping hey or us! She/we doesn't/don't need help!  Note to Jon: Please understand that Krissie and I can work through our problems by ourselves. Remember--it was you getting involved with them in the first place that caused a great deal of new problems, and solved few, if any, others.  Note to Krissie:  Yes, I'm still interested in working everything out between us so we can be good again. I haven't stopped caring, and I hoped you haven't either.   Ok, if he only knew, I have no idea what Jon is doing, if he is trying to help Jared and I, I don't understand why, He knows I dont like Jared anymore... so.. i dunno ... Im going to need to give him a talking to......  "couples" "as most couples do" ?????    EXCUSE ME??   we arent a couple no more... sure we worked out our differences before.. but .. not now.... i guess he doesnt see that im not interested and neither does jon.. do i have to screem it for the world to hear.... Jon knows i like him... if i havnt told u guys that I  DO .. its the truth .. hes got himself a gf.. so hes good as a best friend.. but if hes going to like me back why is he helping Jared try not to lose me... jared is right its not his place... but im only getting this from jareds journal... so i guess ill talk to Jon later.. Ill keep you posted    SONG: Denied - Our Lady Peace  MOOD: somewhere in between, confused, bored, tired, sick, happy, and madurlLink    urlLink audio post  powered by  urlLink audblogurlLink    urlLink audio post  powered by  urlLink audblogJust when your at you all time high   OK .. I have a solo in band, that i won fair and fucking square and well 'Oboe Lady' (adrien) is a quick who is in my drama class and band class, gets the same monologs as me, the same parts as me, she has the same insturment, and she thinks shes better then me... so when i get a solo in band... she gets all jelous and crap.. and her ego goes way up thinking she can do it way better then me so she should get it.. so today in band class we start the song for the first time...  and i start my solo and i screw up on this half note continusly and the teacher gets frusterated and makes a big seen .... then he asks oboe lady to help me out.... and play along with me.. LIKE THATS GOING TO HELP.. anyway so i gave my teacher a dirty look and went with the flow.... her reed wasnt working so she was aweful and i felt great... but after awhile she starts coping down the notes for the solo.. and IM LIKE... NO U DONT THIS IS MY SOLO ... but i didnt say that .. and i tryed to make it so she couldnt see the notes but she just kept looking over my sholder and all taht stuff... then FINALLY before she can finish... i put my music away and she asks if she can see my notes.. and i basically said no... because ... she wont be playing it for long..   also i got hit by a car and almost ran over walking home after band practise  and OH KEON.. ok i called him last night and the phone conversation was great and he was happy and everything.. and he wants to get together tomorrow.. but i havnt been able to get a hold of him so i think its off... ill try right now..and HES HOME.. i have to call him back in 15 minues... i wonder who hes on the phone with.. anyway so i guess i willb egetting together with him... i think he likes someone else too tho so... i dunno ill have to get it out of him..    MOOD: MAD!, happy...., kinda mixed other wise  Song- Breathe - by someone... lolIts amazing how something so small can warm your heart and change the way you see everything   Ok, I have to share something with u guys, i was talking to Jon, of course he read my journal entry and he is well... appologizing as much as he can, i dunno... we kinda talked things out... i think im just bitter cause well... everything lately sucks...   but in a cry for someone to talk to ... I called Keon, knowing he wouldnt answer and.. low and behold i was wrong... he picked up.. and he sounded happy.. and he knew who i was.. and he had to go cause he was talking to his dad long distance .. but i can call back.. in 20 minutes! .. so... YAY .. I thought he hated me.... i dunno .. i think its wrong cause he stood me up a few times.. but .. i dunno... im asking for trouble.. i know it.. but im desperate.. and he is sweet... just alittle odd at times.... well .. i know... things turn around quick dont they....  Ill get back to u...   MOOD: EXSITED!The weirdest days are yet to come   Jon and I faught yesterday, although i have such strong feelings for him, i also feel a sense of resentment towards him, maybe its not resentment... but I ... I seem to have problems talking to him sometimes, maybe jelousy, or something else, i dunno...... Anyway, that date with  Mr. X  was no go, No show, I got stood up, wow did i see that coming or what, he was too busy and I had to tell mom about it and when i called him asking where he was she dictated everything for me to say and my mom scared him away. so he said "forget it"... a day after he broke up with  Mrs. X  and now... I'm alone again... and not even able to have ... Jon in the back of my head... he said something last night, hit me kinda hard, because well, i realised that its no different with him or Jared, I'm no good this far away from him, so whats the point of gapping over it..... I didnt talk to anyone today...... at school... i was by myself .. and i could care less if people missed me or not...   MOOD: Lonely, Sad, Lost  Song: Hello -EvenesenceWednesday of this week, my wife Elizabeth and I found out that we will soon become parents! Soon, if March is soon for you.   Funny because my wife has always been the one saying "I want to have babies", while making cutesy hands, but since the news has come, really doesn't act all that excited, but nausea can do that to you. Really, the depth of the revelation has not fully hit us yet, but we are very happy.   One of the main purposes of this Blog will be to document the belly growth visually as the next 6 1/2 months pass. Oh, and I guess I will put up some photos when the little one appears.     Also in other news...           I am leaving work soon  (don't worry, I've earned this break)  to head down to Noblesville near Indy to see Sting! This will be my 3rd time seeing him live, and a delayed birthday present to myself. I'll be meeting Jenn Swift and a friend of hers. I'll give an update on this event next posting.Man In Superman Costume Attacks Motorists     Yesterday we reported that a few dozen Spider-men took over a Peruvian university.

Be good ...    urlLink NBC 4 - News - Man In Superman Costume Attacks Motorists    A group of college students in Lima, Peru donned Spider-Man masks, took over several campus buildings, and demanded the removal of the university dean. Good thinking, kids. Because nothing says "I mean business" like Halloween costumes. I'm going to go put on my Aquaman suit and ask for a raise now ...    urlLink News StoryLive From Ohio, It's Youth Night!     So, the Youth Rally was tonight. I think it was a success. Maybe not. We expected 200 or more kids from different youth groups all throughout Ohio, but only 149 were in attendance. We started with the skit, which I'll get into a little later, then the activity, then we ate, sang discordantly, and had a sermon. The sermon was great, done by a Mr. James Hawkins, future missionary to Spain. The singing was bad and not from the heart, then again we wing it when we do sing at Youth Rallies. The eating was good, and there was a lot of extra pizza and soda, some of which I brought home due to excess amounts. The activity looked complicated and confusing, but luckily, Tim and I didn't have to do it -- instead, we got to make sure others were doing it right. And finally, the skit...  It was genius, or something close to genius. The whole activity was basically a spy thing: aptly named "Mission Possible," I won't explain the rules because they were complicated, but everyone was on a mission using their Bibles to stop sinful things like bitterness and laziness by looking up verses talking about each. Well, the opening skit went like this: I, in a shirt and tie and carrying a briefcase with a cell phone on my belt, started walking down the main aisle of the church. Halfway down the aisle (it's a small church) the phone rang; I answered it, had a one-sided conversation ("Yes, I have received the instructions... yes, we will be rendevouzing at the church tonight..." etc.), then proceeded to the front of the church. I laid down the briefcase on a table and started a conversation with Tim (who played "Agent Banks"). Following the few short lines we exchanged, I pulled out a tape, set it in the tape player, and turned it on; one of my teachers then, over the microphone, acted as the tape and explained the mission. She said it would self destruct in ten seconds, so I pulled it out, fumbled it around, dropped it a couple times, then dropped it back into the briefcase. There was a piece of flash paper resting on some foil near the top; I took out a candle lighter and lit it to make it look like an explosion. Then we exchanged two more lines and prayed, and it was over.  At least, that was what was SUPPOSED to happen. And for the most part, it did. But at the part where I was supposed to light the paper, the candle lighter decided that it didn't want to work. So here I am, holding the dumb thing and pressing the button -- click, click, click -- and there was supposed to be a self destruction. Finally it worked, and there was a flash of fire, then we went on.  Next order of business: I hate ProHosting. I set up the YDKJ forum (check the links) on free.prohosting.com, because they offer unlimited bandwidth for no price. Now I get an email saying that they want a one-time $10 membership fee to remove the ads. So I need a credit card and I have to pay $10 once in order to have an ad-less forum. I don't even *want* the ads gone, but I don't have a choice. It's pay or wave goodbye to your account. I'm upset about this, and emailed them saying that they need an option to keep the ads for people that don't want to pay, but the stuck-up woman simply replied "we've offered free hosting for years. Please continue to support free.prohosting.com." Grr, it makes me so mad... anyhow, I posted at the forum, asking if somebody with a credit card was willing to contribute through PayPal. No luck so far, though. If I don't get it paid in fourteen days -- well, thirteen, since I got the letter yesterday -- then the account is deactivated. Thirty days, and it's deleted forever. So... what's a guy to do?  Okay, I'm about done for tonight with my ranting and all. I'll post again tomorrow night, same time, same place. Oh, by the way: Priscilla complained to me and whined that I didn't put her into the blog, so I say: Priscilla is a girl. There, I mentioned you! Happiness! Good night.This Tape will Self-Destruct...     Hello again, friends and strangers. Time to make another page in the chronicle of Blog Blog Blog Blog.  Today was an okay day. I practiced more for the skit at tomorrow's Youth Rally. Tim and I really aren't prepared at all... we got barely any time to practice our lines, and only have a bare understanding of the core of what we're doing. Luckily, we're allowed to improvise, since it's only a short three minute skit. I want it to be a surprise for those who have yet to see it, so I'll post up the results of what happended tomorrow night. It is REALLY cool, and if it wasn't serious, would leave a lot of room for comical mischief. (All those that don't care, say aye.) Anyhow, we have maybe an hour and a half of rehearsal under our belts, so luckily it isn't TOO important, and the job we have to do will be done easily.  Dad picked me up today from school, and we went to my favorite toy store -- Best Buy. I need a new hard drive for my computer, so we took a look at what they had to offer; I expected to walk away with a 60-gig 7200RPM hard drive, but they didn't have any, and even if they did, we found a better deal. For about $20 more (after rebate) I found a 100gb hard drive. As soon as Dad gets paid, he's gonna grab it and bring it over to me. I can't wait. Right now I'm running a 7-gig... the new one will be nearly  fifteen times larger  than what I have. I've had this harddrive since 1997/98 when it came with the computer, and it's about high time I grab a new one. I'm giddy. Now all I need to keep my computer as up-to-date as possible will be a new motherboard and a new processor (400mhz isn't quite sufficient anymore, especially to a multitasker who uses Kazaa, Flash 4, and sometimes RPGMaker2000 at the same time.)  Ben Folds is amazing. I just watched his limited edition live DVD last night for the first time... he completely turned around Song for the Dumped from an upbeat song to a sadder song with a slower tempo and a different tune, plus he added a lot of extra stuff. I've never had the privilege to see Mr. Folds live, but the DVD proves that seeing a life show would be simply awesome. (Army was cool, too, I love the audience interaction.)  That's about all I have to say, so I'll close with this: HUZZAH, FINAL FANTASY X-2! Farewell.Judgment Day     Today was a day I like to call the Day of Reckoning, or Judgment Day, or Happy Chainsaw Thursday, if you choose. First, foremost, and most important to me,  I passed my Biblical Ethics test today!  I scored a 94%. That had to be the toughest test I've ever taken -- the questions were hard, but, if I failed, I would have basically let my Pastor down, so there was an added sense of urgency. But I didn't fail, I passed! Yeeee!  Otherwise, Kevin was expelled today. The dummy got what was coming to him. Finally, after the supervisors and Pastor have been putting up with his crap for a long time, they dismissed him. A sad thing indeed, but I have no remorse whatsoever for their actions. He promised the school in a formal statement that he wouldn't participate in immoral and un-Christian things. Yet he did anyway. He got so many chances to change himself, and I mean a lot of chances -- even after the Pastor found out that he smokes and after many, many disciplinary efforts, he still got more chances to change. They believed in him, and he threw it all away. What a dummy.  And so I refer to today as "Judgment Day," the day that futures were decided. I kept up the work and devotion to God, and he kept up his wrongful ways and his misbehavior, and now the good Lord made some changes... I passed the test and earned the Pastor's and the supervisors' respect, and he lost it all. Pity...  So... Happy Chainsaw Thursday. I passed, he left. I'm happy, he's in big trouble with his life. The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; in this case, well, both. But now I have some American History to bother with, so good bye for now -- if there's any new developments, I'll update.HAHBHN-Day     I'm baaaaaaaaack.  Today's the first day of my real journal-y existence.  Today was, in summary, a happy-angry-happy-bored-happy-nervous day. I went to school. HAPPY! My supervisor was on my case all morning. ANGRY! I learned of my passing of an Algebra test. HAPPY! I went home and did homework. BORED! I went to church. HAPPY! I came home and have to study for a big Biblical Ethics test. NERVOUS!  I'm almost through with the Biblical Ethics course, I finished the eleventh lesson today and will test tomorrow. I'm scared out of my dress shoes. I've learned a lot from the course, though; as much as it took away from my mornings for the past two weeks, it's been real helpful in teaching me how to deal with life and how to live happily. God is spiffy. Anyhow, I have a lot to study, because I do NOT want to fail something like this.  Oh, and Edmund Randolph was in George Washington's cabinet. (Washington decided to save him for later so he stored him in there for safe keeping.) Dumb statement, but that was the main thing I forgot on my American History test today. Jefferson was Secretary of State, Hamilton was Secretary of the Treasury, Knox was Secretary of War, and dumb old Randolph was Attorney General. Why I'm reiterating this, I don't know.  The Youth Rally is coming up this Saturday evening. I can't wait. Other than that, I'm done. Good night, friends!Ahoy, Thar Be Blogs - Part II     Look! I'm updating again on the same day!  King's Quest 2 VGA is also spiffy. Go check it out.  urlLink Tierra Entertainment is spiffy.  GO THERE, OR GET POKED WITH THE STICK OF DOOM AND LUNACY!!Ahoy, Thar Be Blogs - Part I     This is my blog. I don't know what a blog is. Is it a journal? Yes? No? Why am I asking you?  I'm going to write something here. Let's see.  Eternal Darkness is fun. It lets you go insane, something too many people say they are in the first place, but it really lets you go insane. You get a sane-o-meter that goes down when you go insane. Oooo. Lots of fun.  I'm done talking about that. Now let's talk about what I did today. I woke up and went to school. I am exciting. What can I say, I have nothing to talk about. So goes the life of the lifeless. Ooh, look, potatoes!Smelly fish fin made the tea?     Think of what tonight's title rhymes with. Here's three clues.   1. It's like Television, only it's grape or strawberry. 2. It happened yesterday and I'm really happy about it. 3. If you can't get this one, then you really don't know jack.   Give up? Of course you do. Tonight's title is a Gibberish question from the ultimate quiz show party game, "You Don't Know Jack." And what does it rhyme with? Of course, stupid, smell fish fin made the tea! That is...  Jellyvision paid the fee!  That's right, my ProHosting problem from a few days ago is been and past, because the makers of You Don't Know Jack -- who are really happy with the forum I put together and the fan support -- are paying the ten dollar fee! I emailed them and asked for webspace, and instead they offered to pay off ProHosting. Not only that, but they're also going to register and maintain our very own www.ydkjforum.com web domain! No more long URL! No more short-but-not-working URL! A real, live, .com address, free from our pals at Jellyvision! They have to be the coolest game designers I've ever known.  That was yesterday. I would have posted here as it happened, but I was too busy with my brand spankin' new $200 digital camera. That's right, we finally bought one, and now I can take high-quality pictures for things! Overjoy! Rapture! So yesterday was a really, really, way cool day.  Oh, and also, I never mentioned that I found a place to stash MOL. anytimenow.com offers 20 megs of storage space, I love it! So now my game is up for download. Check the Deli's Pick (link's at the left) to pull it off the web.  That's my post for tonight. Life is spiffy.Austin Powers: "Mole mole mole"     Major accomplishment today: I finished the demo for my RPG,  The Quest for the Meaning of Life!  I'm proud of the ending I put together. I not only added the ending, but I fine-tuned a lot, like EXP and enemy strength. I sat through the whole of MOL today and did some bug testing, which led to the tuning -- I found 21 things that needed a fix. I fixed it all up and prepared it for the public; I'm not, however, going to put it online yet, not onto my limited Tripod account. I need to find a storage place like I-Drive used to be to put it up, because even though it's only 1.3 megs, I'll run out of bandwidth. (Heh, I could use prohosting, but prohosting isn't free anymore.) That's all I really wanna share for today. I got to boast my Gamecube to my cousin today. It was quite fun. So long.Work, work, work...     Current Song: "I'm Moving On," Rascal Flatts     How things happen the way they do, I'll never know. Andy (you know, YDKJ host and Jellyvision webmaster) and I had been exchanging emails back and forth, discussing the legal matters of JV paying our fee and all. Finally, after several emails to and from each other, he emailed me and said, "Look, why don't you call me instead of all this slow email? It'll be easier." So, I reluctantly (yeah, right) landed a phone call to Jellyvision HQ, Chicago. My dumb voice cracked twice... Puberty's been and gone, maybe my larynx'll catch up to me someday. Anyhow, we spoke for sixteen minutes, discussing the board and chatting about Jellyvision and the hosts of YDKJ and all. It was a grand old time.  So much to catch up on... well, business first. Adam, Jellyvision's tech guy, asked me to port all the crap from the current board to a brand spankin' spiffy new account. I downloaded it all, and... well, let's just say, headache. Here's an excerpt of my letter to Adam last night at 3.   I downloaded all the files directly from the current account into a folder on my hard drive, and downloaded both the Perl and CGI versions of the YaBB source code (partly as a source for default files, and partly since the newest version contains security patches). I uploaded everything from the old board into the new account directly (making sure to upload everything in ASCII as per the instructions) to cgi-bin/YaBB/ and tried to run it; I get a 500 Internal Server Error from ProHosting. I messed with a few of the files, reinstalling the defaults of files that could've gotten accidentally changed or corrupted, and tried again; nothing. I created a different folder -- this time named "yabb" instead of "YaBB" -- and decided to try installing the entire system all over again with the CGI version. I uploaded everything in accordance to what I remember from my experience with installing YaBB before, and tried to run it. Once again, it didn't work, so I decided to give the Perl version a try, and made one last folder -- "forum" -- and followed the instructions exactly. Figuring from the footer on the error messages I was getting, I assume that it's a Unix server and requires chmoding of the files, so I chmoded each file as the instructions requested, and after I had done everything just as it was asking me to do, I tested YaBB.pl and got the same vicious error message. I went to the unofficial free.prohosting.com FAQ to see if they had anything to say about my problem with the scripts, and I found instructions to chmod each file differently than what the YaBB instructions asked, because "that's how Prohosting works."   Shew! What a load of garbage. Oh well. I posted at the yabb support forum. All should be well, if I ever get a reply.  Neeeext... using a Best Buy giftcard, I bought a copy of Dance Dance Revolution Konamix and a dance pad recently. Like, the other day. I had to return the pad a few times due to defectiveness, but now I have a working dance pad and I've burned 200-something calories.  Cody invited me to a Bible study that'll happen tomorrow at 1. I can't wait. One thing I've always liked doing is discussing the Bible with other believers, as I told Mewd earlier after a similar discussion. It'll be super-spiffy. Maybe even spiffalicious?  One final note that I won't touch on: my dad is getting remarried. I don't know what to think. More on that later. Goodnight, Saigon!The old words are reiterated again     Current Song: "Smoke," Ben Folds Five     This entry isn't going to be long. I pointed IE to Blogger ten minutes ago and it just now finished the loading process.  Today, one of my first friends at my school, David, left. It just goes to prove one of my mottos.   Life happens, things change, people move on; can't expect things to stay the same forever.   The reason is really complicated and I'd rather it go without saying just now. But, my dear friend David has left the school, and I've probably seen the last of him today.  I added a song thing under the title bar. Other people do it, so why not. I don't feel up to avoiding conformism tonight.  This has just been an all-out terrible, stressful, depressing day. I want to end it with God's gift of sleep. Oh, wait, I can't -- homework. Overjoy. Well, I'll be off to do my homework while eating pizza and waiting for The Cosby Show to hit the air.   Note in advance: I apologize for not changing the "last updated" thing beside the link to my blog on AIM. I signed off already and don't wanna get back on. And I also apologize for the wrong coding in my last entry; I used [b] instead of   (without the period there, for the HTML deprived). The YDKJ forum uses [b] for bold, and I just finished posting there, so I used it instead. I'll fix it now. End this day already...!Unessential     Current Song: "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road," Elton John     I don't know why Goodbye, Yellow Brick Road is my current song... it's going through my head.  Sorry for the lack of updating. Haven't found the time. I got it up and done Friday, and the YDKJ Forum is now the lowest of my priorities. It's all finished and together again, just waiting on the .com to be prepared.  Next... one of the two biggest things on my mind at this time: the weekend. I don't know. I love my dad and want to see him happy, but he's getting married on Saturday, and I'm very uncomfortable with it. I like Chris, I really do; but there's just something about seeing my dad marry another woman, somebody that isn't my mom -- and furthermore, I'm his best man and, since there's no priest (it's only a ceremony), I'm reading his vows off. That's a major struggle right there, reading off vows from my dad to another woman... I'm not going to let him down, though. I'm going to swallow my emotions and do it in a happy manner. But there's just inner hurt that I don't quite know how to deal with.  I won't get into the second big thing now. I won't boast about tomorrow until I know what tomorrow brings. (Not tomorrow per se, but tomorrow as in, the future.)  I just feel unnecessary, unessential, that everything I'm striving for is in vain. All the work I do, the hope I reserve, and the promising I make, it all feels like the wall's crumbled down and there's nothing to inspire me to pick up the pieces. I just feel like nothing I'm doing has any reason and that everything I understand is slipping away from me.  Pray for me, I need it.One hundred two point six     Current Song: "Hot Blooded," Foreigner     Hot Blooded's been going through my head a lot in the past couple days. Well, one part specifically: "I'm hot blooded, check it and see -- I've got a fever of a hundred and three."  Yes, guys and gals, for the past three or four days I've been sick with some kind of flu or something. Tuesday night, I came home from my aunt's house and felt my head burning. I took my temperature, and clocked in at 99 point something... great. I felt like I was gonna throw up. Luckily, it's Friday night and I'm happy to announce that my face has not hugged the toilet bowl. However, it  has  hugged the ice pack.  Wednesday I had no school, my teacher's mother-in-law died and since it's a really small school and everyone's close to each other they called it off Wednesday due to her funeral. I wasn't feeling too bad Wednesday afternoon and all, and Wednesday night wasn't too bad aside from my eyes starting to burn.  Now we shuffle along to Thursday morning. I sat up and asked Mom if I could stay home since I'd been feeling a bit under the weather. She decided to try and get the best of me and said that the only way I'd be kept home is with a temperature of 100. She didn't think that would happen. I shoved the thermometer under my tongue and waited for the woman inside to announce my temperature. Okay, so I cheated a little -- I looked at the digital screen and saw my temperature in advance, but nonetheless I pulled it out of my mouth at 100.5. I was happy -- no school! Mom didn't really know what to say, but it WAS over 100 and thus I stayed home.  It was cool that I was staying home... until I awoke again two hours later. I spent all morning and afternoon in my bed, mostly watching SNL reruns (Alec Baldwin is awfully unfunny) and stand up comedy on Comedy Central. At three, I started surfing the channels looking for something else to watch. I turned on Montel Williams. Rape victims convict a serial rapist -- the topic caught my attention (no, I'm not some freak that's turned on by rape; I just love hearing about people bringing a criminal to justice) and that occupied my screen till 4. By that time, my eyes were burning up and watering like a broken faucet, so I rested my head and tried sleeping. Mom returned from the store and I took my temperature. I felt lovely after hearing the tinny woman in the thermometer announce my body temperature -- 102.3. Mom gave me an ice pack for my burning head and I tried sleeping. Somewhere in there, the temperature climbed to 102.6. Mom called the doctor and asked for her advice. The doctor advised her to give me some Motrin. I took the medicine at 5:30 and by 6:30 I was up and out of bed. I ate (veal parmesian, yum!) and got onto the computer. My fever had managed to drop to 98.8 -- joy. Time passed. At 11:45 I got offline and took my temperature. It was back up to 101. I ended up taking two more Motrin pills at 12:45 or so and tried watching two of the final three episodes of Cheers. I fell asleep at 1:45.  Woke up. Friday. I wasn't going to school. I relaxed in bed for a while; turned on the TV and watched more standup comedy. I don't really remember what all happened today, aside from playing Metroid Fusion and eating chicken-broccoli soup. I took more Motrin at 3:30 and got out of bed at 4:30. I fed the cats, drank some Mountain Dew and got back on the computer... and here I am.  So, that's my last couple of days. Still with me? Good. I'm sorry I haven't updated recently, it's sort of obvious why I haven't. So here's the update. Now that you're done peering into my life, why not download  Opera 7  and see the browser I'm now in love with? It DEFINATELY beats Internet Explorer and looks pretty cool, too. Yeah, Opera rocks. There, I plugged them.Life Simulation's a Hoot     Current Song: "Zelda: The Music of my Groin," by Shael Riley     Don't ask about the song. For your sake.  Life simulation's a hoot. John's gotten me hooked on the Animalese-speaking world of Animal Crossing. That game is more fun than a life simulator should be. Of course, it was only a matter of time before those people hooked on video games and computers would need a life sim, and it's only those people who get full satisfaction out of living a pretend life. The game is increduously fun, and even the "real-time" bit feels appropriate. For the first time in a game, I actually felt "just seconds too late" as it was 10:02 and the store closed at 10, making me just two real minutes late. It's just the weirdest thing, a game that's awake when you are.  Anyhow, I don't have very much to speak of now... everything's back to normal and all, and things are quiet. I follow up a giant post with a tiny one. Faretheeallwell.Hey! I didn't die!     Current Song: "Yesterday," by the Beatles     No! I'm alive! I just haven't updated, and for a good reason:  Because I don't like Microsoft.  Yes, Microsoft ties into it. Recently, well, not recently, about two months ago, I changed browsers to Opera, and Blogger doesn't work right with Opera. I guess they changed something or something like that, but now I can update in Opera, although the window's a little small -- anyway, I couldn't use Opera and would have to use IE, and I hate IE, mostly because it doesn't work on my computer, and partly because it's slow and Opera has a lot of cool features. (You get spoiled on being able to move Back and Forward with the mouse.) So, that's why I haven't been updating.  That, and my life is boring.  If you must know, recently: I got into Magic: The Gathering, I got into Zelda: The Wind Waker, and I got into bed and slept a few times. I don't really know what else interesting has happened. Steve's gonna come up to Ohio and visit this Summer, which I'm really excited about. I'm itching to face him in Super Smash Bros. Melee. Oh, and I've relaunched my  urlLink site , and now have a redesign and more content. Last night I finished The Bed That Ate You -- why not go take a look?  Oh, and I had a birthday! Yes, I'm another year older. And for my birthday, I received two tickets to see the all-time funniest comedian ever tomorrow night -- Bill Cosby. I CAN'T WAIT. (This entry says April 19th because it's 1:30AM, but tomorrow night means the night of April 19th.) It's gonna be spiffy!  That's all for now, I'll update again soon. Now, back to my song.I am  too  a nerd.     Current Song: "A Certain Shade of Green," Incubus            urlLink take the nerd test.   urlLink  and go to mewing.net. a nerd utopia.       Yeah, Bill Cosby was awesome. I'm so glad we went, I had a blast. It was over too soon... just when I wasn't expecting it, "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, have a good night." It was a lot of fun and it was great to be seeing the man in person.  I really don't have very much to say... went and bought a Sliver deck in Magic. I love Slivers, they're spiffy and useful. But now I have nothing to spend...Stuff and computer upgrades     Current Song: "Bring Back the Sun," Our Lady Peace     Today's just not been a good day. The start was fine, the end is... eeech. That's all I'll say.  I got my laptop about a week ago... $50 for four gigs, 80 megs of RAM, and 233mhz processor. I like it, it's useful, mostly for keeping my journal protected and hidden. (It's also a great way to play Half-Life.)  I also got a new hard drive from my dad... eighty gigabytes as opposed to the seven I had. It was all installed on the same day I got the laptop (April 24) and it works fine. And there's nothing much else new, so I'll just end this entry now.The Dragon at rest     Current Song: "Mercyful Fate," Metallica     Okay, so we didn't drop SBC after all. Heh.  Mom managed to somehow get an SBC technician to come to our house for free, to get everything taken care of and out of the way for no charge at all. I'm impressed, dunno how she did it, but she did, and now we have our DSL up again.  I guess I can trust it. As it turns out, Brad found problems with our phone line. Surprising, considering our wires are so old, they probably gave Moses his phone line. Furthermore, the modem was shot in the first place, and the guy replaced it for free. I don't blame SBC for the problems; I originally thought it was the weather giving us problems, but it was our wiring all along that must've been jolted by the stormage. So now I'm back on my high speed. I love it, and missed it.  But now... I have nothing to do online. Maybe I'll go download some E3 trailers... Metroid Zero Mission's gonna be spiffy, by the way. Cheerio.Urgh... times infinity.     Current Song: "Yesterday," The Beatles     Yes, I already used this song a few entries ago. But you know what? It kind of fits.  Saturday was wonderful. I installed a DSL router and we picked up a wireless card for my laptop, so I could plug the ethernet cable on into the router and have a split connection, the PC and the Laptop both online at once. It was COOL. The wireless connection rocked, it gave me hardly any problems and was a sinch to set up. I was up till five in the morning, just talking away, surfing, using the internet from my room.  Then Sunday struck. And when Sunday struck, "Yesterday" came into play. "Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away... now it looks as though they're here to stay."  Sunday morning, I woke up, and guess what. The DSL light on my modem -- off! Yes, boys and girls, my DSL just stopped working. I spent most of Sunday fooling with wires, talking with technical support, scolding my modem, everything... it just didn't work. The DSL light would flicker, and sometimes it would stay on for two minutes, sometimes five minutes, sometimes it wouldn't even find a connection at all. Eventually, I deducted (yes, deducted -- not deduced, deducted) that something was wrong with the phone line, seeing as our phone was really staticy, but I wasn't sure.  *Click, click* Monday! I came home from school, and the DSL light was ON. Yes! It worked! For about fifteen minutes, that is. Then it flickered, and came back on within fifteen seconds. That's the story of yesterday. I'd be online for a nice chunk of time, then get kicked, and then get on, then kicked, and eventually it started kicking me into submission and I couldn't even get online. That's yesterday.  *Click, click* Fast forward to today. I come home from school... nothing. The power light was on, but the others were all off. No signal what-so-ever. And to top it off, our phone didn't work. It would be on for half a minute, with a bunch of static, then I'd get a dial tone. That was definately from the phone line, so I was right that it's giving us trouble... it's just too coincedential to not be the phone line. The phone problems and DSL problems started at the same time. Not that it matters anymore, though, because after watching the modem do absolutely nothing, then turning it off and on and watching it malfunction a bit, I called technical support. Guess what? My DSL modem is dead. Shot. No more. Down the drain. Kaploosh.  We're at a decision point. Either we sort out the many, many problems with the DSL, get a new modem, and then go through more trouble later... or, we kill the DSL bit and switch to Adelphia PowerLink Cable. I'd like to keep the DSL, because I don't wanna change my email address and I get 700mb or so of web space that I need to house files for my website. However, I am TIRED, sick and tired, of putting up with it! I want to get something that works. DSL was fine for a year, no problems whatsoever, nice speed, etc. But when the problems started hitting, they weren't minor problems, they all had a huge payload that threw me into a boat somewhere in the middle of Lake Erie and ran off with the paddle. So, I don't wanna put up with it anymore. Unfortunately, until we get things sorted, I have no broadband connection... but I have a solution.  While we get everything all together with what ISP we use, I'm going to sign up for a free trial of AOL. LUCKILY, my laptop came with a 56k modem, so I popped that in, threw in a phone cable, installed AOL, and got online using my uncle's screenname. (Sorry, it was my only choice... besides, you guys were in bed when I got on anyway!) That's where I am right now... on AOL. Tomorrow I intend on going for a free trial, so I can at least correspond with the world while we work on getting together broadband. Ahh well. That's my entry... huge as it is. That's my last couple of days. Aie...  OH! BUT BEFORE I GO! LUCASARTS RELEASED A TRAILER FOR SAM AND MAX: FREELANCE POLICE, THEIR NEW SNM GAME!!! WAA-diddily-HAAHAAA!! ...anyway. Yeah. Go watch it. Now. http://www.lucasarts.com  "WHY... WON'T... YOU... JUST... DIE?!"'Could it be? Could it really, truly be?'     Current Song: [Space Quest Four MIDI soundtrack]     We may have isolated the problem. Every time it's rained since we got the router two weeks ago, the DSL's been killed. The first time, Brad the Tech Guy came out and solved our problems. Until it rained again. Then the DSL was killed. That would be my last entry, 5/20.  Well, two nights ago, my youth minister suggested I unplug our cordless phone from the wall and see what happens, if it was fixed. So yesterday, I unplugged our cordless. After about an hour and a half, the DSL was stable. So today, I plugged it back in after school. After an hour and a half or so, while it drizzled a bit, the DSL flickered back out. I unplugged it. Hour and a half later, it came back. And that's where I am now. It seems that the cordless phone is our problem... however, it's supposed to rain more this weekend. We're going to keep the phone unplugged and if the DSL goes out when it rains, then the phone isn't the problem.. but as it seems right now, the phone is the problem. At least, the phone jack could be it... I don't know. But I seem to be back online now... I keep watching the modem to see if I lose the connection. Hasn't dropped it yet, and as of this writing, it's been on for half an hour. Well, thirty five minutes.  So, we'll see.The Re-revenge of Yesterday     Current Song: "Yesterday," The Beatles     I am so mad right now.  It's been four glorious days of broadband for me. After the tech came out and fixed our lines, I was online again. IT ALL ENDED ONCE MORE TODAY! Ugh! I don't know if I can take this anymore! It stormed again, and now that it stormed my DSL flickers in and out. I'm back on Dialup... AGAIN... and I hate it...  Is it so bad for me to have a working connection?  Gah... well, I have this AOL trial until June 20 or so, so it'll be available until Steve comes to visit. Around there, at least. I guess a month is more time than I think, so hopefully it'll be once again sorted out. Things looked so good, too...  We want to stay with SBC, we really do. What are we supposed to do? I'm not going to keep this up. Here's to praying we get another free tech if needs be... because right now, it looks like it needs be. Sigh...  On another note, I've modified my layout, and changed the header colors to fit. Don't know why you care, though.The World Has Turned and Left Me Here     Current Song: "Selfless, Cold, and Composed," Ben Folds Five     I hooked the phone back up at three to call Jessie today. My DSL's stopped really kicking me off... it stopped responding once, but it was different. It didn't flicker out, but just kinda froze while the router tried to contact it. It's now 11:43, so it's been solid for the past eight hours and forty three minutes... except that fluke. What do I make of this? It's not the phone that's the problem. It's OBVIOUSLY the wiring, and since Brad the Tech Guy fixed our wiring -- not to mention the fact that our phones and the phone upstairs in my aunt's house is screwy -- it's most likely outside the house. On the phone with Jessie earlier, it was kinda staticy. The DSL isn't following a pattern as to how it shuts down... it just stays on or doesn't. I managed a few games of Starcraft with Mewd earlier, too. I have no doubt that it'll flicker off again. But for now, it's okay... and the phone works and all... so... yeah. I'm going to bed.Been a while...     Current Song: n/a     Hi there. I'm finally remembering to update my blog again... so, yeah.  Steve's here right now, sitting in the chair next to me, looking tired. He's been here for a couple days, and will be here until tomorrow, when he flies back across the United States to go home to his room decorated with the colors of his site.  Anyhow, I'm going to make this entry short; ever since June 4th, my DSL has been fixed. Pete the Tech Guy came out and looked at the wires, and sure enough, they were crappy. They were so messed up, any rainwater would screw over the line... so, yeah, it's been fixed and stable, and I haven't been on dialup in ages. And that's just about everything I have to say. Cheers!Wooohoo! I win! One to nothin!     Current Song: "Tribute," Tenacious D      Mwahaha! These past couple days have been wonderful.  First off, and most importantly, yesterday, I asked someone very special to me out. I don't want to say who -- it's kind of a surprise right now. But I'm no longer single -- sorry, ladies, I know you were all after me, but that's the way the ball drops. (Okay, so only one lady's been after me, and she's now my girlfriend. Sue me.) So, yeah, that's great.  Second, I got my job! Finally, after stalling a phone call for a long time, I am now a maintenance assistant at a hotel. I'll be doing some janitor work and helping the maintenance guy, but now I'll be working! Finally! Money to go toward my new iBook! And I get the hours that I wanted! I am so happy about it... and can't wait till next week when I start. I asked for something after eleven, and the manager agreed whole-heartedly. So... money! Work! Responsibility! Tithe! Woohoo!Tired and jaded     Current Song: "Emaline," Ben Folds (live)     Work is already makin me tired. I've only been on the job for two days, but my feet hurt. Poor me.  But I'm complaining. I really, really like the job. I'm basically, a janitor. I sweep, mop, clean the pool, help out Dale (the maintenance guy), take out garbage, etc. And I'm paid pretty well for my first job. Plus, I'm working a steady noon to four, weekdays only, so I get my nights and weekends. I'm gonna have that iBook!  I went out and got a Blockbuster Freedom Pass today... mom's paying for it, but I'm gonna pay her back when I'm paid. They're doing the freedom pass year-round, now, not just in the summer... $20 a month, and I can rent a game, keep it, exchange it for something else, anything I want for a whole month. And if I like it, I reinstate it and get it next month. And etcetera. It's a great deal. Tonight I rented MGS2: Substance, but I'll be taking it back tomorrow and probably getting Enter the Matrix. I just wanted to see how Substance was, and what was in it... but I've already beaten MGS2 several times and don't really need to go through it again, so I'm gonna go grab something else. So... yeah.  I'm sorta worn out, so I'm gonna probably get in bed. Bed, at 10:50... a summer first for me. Oh well.All the children, siiiing...     Current Song: "Song for the Dumped," Ben Folds (live DVD edition)     Nothing eventful today, except that tomorrow I start my job... woohoo. I dunno why I'm suddenly feeling regret about it. I want to work, and make money, and get my uncle off my back about getting a job... And it's not like I won't be able to get online anymore, I'll be working four or five hours a day, nothing huge. And the work won't even be HARD. I'm basically a janitor, and the hotel doesn't usually need cleaning. I'm just afraid of it, I guess. Responsibility. Yuck.  So, yeah... that's about it. Talked to Jessie today on the phone, again, and beat Quest for Glory II with my wizard. Woo, now he is Deathfoot the Paladin! Yeah, baby, over 110 honor points. Oh, and last night I changed the picture of myself at the side, to reflect the fact that I've been in a good mood lately. The other pic was depressed-looking, because at the time I took it my DSL was down. The new one is happier. But, that's about it... so I'll just kinda sign out for now. Have a nice blog.  (By the way, the current song does my no means reflect current events. I've just had that version of BFF's Song for the Dumped in my head for a long time... and Ben makes it hilarious on the DVD, so, that's my current song. Woo.)   Late Update: Me again. Just posting some last minute worries about the job. I'm jittery, and want to find out just what's going on with my scheduling and stuff. I really want weekends off... all I need is 20 or 25 hours a week. Hopefully, 25, so I still have around $100 a week after tithe... but whatever I get is good. I'll hopefully be able to work after school when I go back, so if I don't raise the $1000 by the end of summer, I should still be cool. We'll see... I just don't want to give up too much time with my internet friends. The few people I constantly talk to are pretty much my life. Especially my girlfriend. So.. yeah. 1:08AM. I oughtta go to bed soon. I gotta wake up at 11. Hrm. I'm nervous. Pray for me.What a wonderful woooorrllllld     Current Song: "Dope Nose," Weezer     I feel great right now. Just got off the phone with Jessie, so, I'm in a good mood.  I start work on Tuesday... noon to four. I'm really excited about the job, I just hope the maintenance guy doesn't schedule me for weekends... but if he does, I don't mind, I can get by on a few hours of sleep, I've gotten up for school and all okay, so. I'm sure I can handle it all. I just can't wait to start earning my money... check it out!    urlLink    The Apple iBook... 800mhz of notebook glory.     That is my goal, to raise $999 this summer and purchase an Apple iBook. I love that computer. I want one, badly. I'll need a new laptop, this one is spiffy but it's not too powerful and I don't know how much longer it'll last... so, yeah. I need a new one. I've had my eye on a Mac for a long time, and now that I'm getting a job my dream may become a reality.  Oh, another thing: I have a new host for my site! Update your bookmarks (yeah, right). Instead of http://renomasterson.tripod.com, it's now http://renomasterson.shadowonline.com. My new host gives me unlimited bandwidth, 20mb of space, CGI, PHP, Cpanel, the works. And if I need more space he can give it to me. Lorenz Pleiss is a very cool person. Anyhow, yeah, I have a new host, but the site's the same... GO SIGN MY GUESTBOOK! Time to blow this seafood restaurant. See you all later.   I got a job!Find Therma.     Current Song: [Big Band, Bebop, and Bones: The Grim Fandango Soundtrack]     Been a long while, hasn't it? I really figure I should update this thing...  I'm definately not getting that iBook by the end of the summer. I was just laid off for two weeks from my job... they decided that they don't have the money to support me, so I can't go back to work until Jason, the usual evening maintenance guy, leaves to return to college. And besides, I'm spending my money left and right as it is... I ordered Discworld Noir last weekend, and just ordered Tony Tough and Gabriel Knight 3 tonight... all adventure games. I won't play GK3 until I've played GK2, which Jessie's going to lend to me. But Tony Tough just looks plain cool. It's a revitalzation of hope for our little genre. I mean, come on, any developer COURAGEOUS enough to make a 2D game in late 2002, and to make it really, really good for that matter, PROVES that there's hope left in the world for adventure gamers.  And Discworld Noir's pretty cool, too. But that's a couple years old and 3D. I'm not saying it's bad, by no means. But Tony Tough is just really refreshing in that it's brand new, pretty much, and 2D.  I'll shut up now.  So yeah, my job WAS going good, and it will be going good again when I go back to work. It's a cool job, I enjoy it, and I get a good pay for my first job and all. But, whatever, it's a good vacation and I'm glad to have some more time off. I'll be working the school year, too, so... yeah. It's a good thing, because I have things to save up for -- Castlevania: Lament of Innocence, and Sam and Max: Freelance Police, and Full Throttle: Hell on Wheels, and other various wastes of money I might find.  Ahh, the working life is good.

So visit! Please! Populate!  Annnnnnnd... I'm off!And then... I WASN'T HERE!     Current Song: "The I'm No Longer on Blogger Anthem," Reno Masterson     Well, lookie there. I have a whole new blog. And it's owned by yours truly, me, not theirs truly, Blogger.  So yeah.  http://renomasterson.shadowonline.com/log  There's the new one. Go. Enjoy. Indulge in news that belongs to someone else.  I suppose this is a bit of a landmark post... my last post on Blogger. I've been here for eight months... blogging away. Memories are stored here... from Youth Night to The Great DSL Loss of '03, to my summer job, I have eight months of memories sporadically tossed around in this little corner of Blogger. I guess I should say something meaningful, or philosophical. I mean... this is it for renomasterson.blogspot.com. It's time for a whole new era. So, after all the memories... I guess there's only one word that's appropriate for my Last Word on Blogger...  And that word is...   BLAEH!!!!Erm... ahem.     Current Song: N/A   Current Mood: Apologetic     Ah... um... haha... yeah, well... hmm, and... ah... yes, with the, ah... and... hmm.  I'm back.  ...and I owe Blogger an apology.  ...sorry, Blogger.  I couldn't make it on my own. I'm coming back to Blogger. It's been exactly three months from today -- well, no, three months from yesterday, technically, but it's 3:52AM on Thursday night to me, so therefore it still feels like the 27th. Three months ago, I left Blogger forever, to start my own blog hosted at my own web space. Well, I posted... maybe four times there. Literally. I hardly used it. I didn't like it. So here I am, back at Blogger, because I need a place to vent my life to the unsuspecting universe.  Welcome back to my story. Get comfortable. This could last a while.  The first news item of the day is as such: ShadowOnline is shutting down. Yes, the best host I've ever had is going under. Lorenz has every right to close it, as he did it for free anyway... but still. I wish there'd been more notice. Bah. Oh well.  I'm very tired, so I think I'm going to go on to bed now. Tomorrow's Friday, and, and... ah, and... and I don't know how that's relevant to anything. Oh well. Sleep tight.Luguuubrious.      Current Song: "Richter's Theme," Castlevania: Dracula X   Current Mood: Quiet... where is everyone?     Well, the Christmas season is upon us. Well... the Christmas season is upon YOU. It didn't really come upon me. It snuck up behind me and nailed me in the skull with a blackjack.  Where did it come from? I don't know! I mean, I KNEW it was the Christmas season, but it's December 23rd! TWO DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS! And I didn't even REALIZE it until a couple days ago! Where did December go? Where did NOVEMBER go? Oh, I know where November went. It sped past as I pushed myself through NaNoWriMo. Which, by the way, I completed. Yes. I finished NaNoWriMo. I wrote a 50,000 word novel in a single month. Well, to tell you the honest truth, I wrote 12,000 of those words on the last day. Yes... the  last day.  Twelve thousand.  ...wow. It STILL surprises me.  Anyway, my novel isn't quite up yet for anyone to see... I didn't exactly finish it as much as meet my 50k quota. Mind you, though, I did do it. It's just nowhere to be seen yet.  Mainly because my website is dysfunctional. As I said in my last post (about a month ago... I am lazy.), ShadowOnline closed its doors. I moved to ProHosting. After Christmas, I'm going to use $10 to pull the ads off of my webspace. See, I wasn't sure if it'd be worth it to buy ad-free-ness, but seeing as my account name is renosix ( urlLink http://fire.prohosting.com/renosix ), I figure that if anything, it'll be great for any pages I make, since it's not exclusively titled after The Deli's Pick. So once Christmas is done and past, I'm going to use that $10 in my wallet to buy my page away from adscurity.  And when I do, I'll be much happier.  Otherwise, you know what I did today? I finished up Fario's first demo, that's what I did. Well, the first OFFICIAL demo, of the fourth incarnation of his first game. Get all that? I haven't uploaded the ZIP file to my Yahoo! Briefcase yet, so it's not quite on the web yet. But it will be. Soon. I'm really proud of it. It consists of World One, and the World One boss fight. That's right, boys and girls, you get to  take down King Poopa with a shoe cannon.  What fun! What excitement! What a moldy loaf of bread it was to program! Hey, it's done, and that's all that matters. Now I have seven other worlds to create...  I've been playing Baldur's Gate and Riven as of late. I have to get back into BG, I haven't played it in a few days, and I have to flat out explore more of Riven. Wow, it's confusing. A lot of wanderlust... but it's spiffy wanderlust. I got the Myst Trilogy as an early Christmas gift, since it was only $20, and so as soon as I finish Riven (yeah, right, maybe summer 2004, seeing as I'm going to try my hardest to use no hints) I'll be able to play Myst III: Exile. Oh, the life of an adventure gamer...  Steve's been idle for four and a half hours. I brb'd to take a shower, returned, and he was idle. And has been. And has been. And has been. And now he's  nowhere to be seen.  I bet he fell asleep.  Also, Mewd is  completely unaware  of the elephant I bought him for Christmas. Mwahahaha! He'll never see it coming! Well, he will, since it's rather large, but he doesn't suspect a THING. Now let's hope he doesn't read my blog.  Merry Christmas, everyone. Tomorrow I'm going to my dad's house for Christmas Eve, and returning on Christmas Morn. I'll probably blog again post-Christmas... unless, that is, I get really bored on Christmas Eve and end up getting online or something. But I'll probably end up devoting my time to sitting in front of the TV, playing something that's compatible with my laptop. I wonder what Riven's system requirements are...   Edit:  AHA! Ludwiggy IMed me! SOMEBODY TO TALK TO!2004, I likes you already     Current Song: "Brain Damage," Pink Floyd   Current Mood: Much happier     See? See? 2004 fi... fi... repaired my laptop problem. (Sorry, a certain key of mine coming betwen z and c is not working at the moment.)  It was a stupid solution. A VERY stupid solution. I'd done everything I usually did to correct the problem. You know what I had to do? I had to remove the battery while it was booted. That's right. While it was booted. And it worked like a charm.  Well, almost. Because now, after much knocking around of my computer to try and knock some sense into it, I guess I have a stuck key. See, it's weird. My... my... you know what, lemme copy and paste something here... x There. My x key doesn't work. In order to type the letter, I have to have it on the clipboard and paste it in when I need it. I don't know why. Furthermore, when I boot the computer, I get a tidal wave of beeps cursed at me from the speakers. After fiddling around, hitting random keys, the stuck key finally gives way or something. Also, for some odd, odd reason, I can't make a capital S or W with the right shift key. If I hold both the shift key and the letter down, then release the shift key, then the letter is typed in a bold, capital flavor. But ONLY then. Every other key works fine with the right shift. S and W work just like regular with the left shift. What gives?  Ah well. Enough about that. At least the laptop works again. I didn't lose anything, thank God.  I've decided that I'm tired of leading a life of purely digital entertainment. It's great, really, but you know, I haven't read through a book in the LONGEST time. This is all going to change. Today, I picked up the one-volume edition of The Lord of the Rings that I've had in my desk for two years and started to read it. Let's get one thing straight right off the bat -- I'm not a fan of LOTR. I don't hate it, either. I don't have any feelings for it. I've seen the first two movies, the second half-heartedly, and remember neither of them. I've always wanted to read the books, but, let's face it, I have trouble reading. For as much as I love writing, I have trouble reading books. I read words just fine. I don't have any kind of deficiency or anything. I just have trouble picturing things in books. I'm trying hard to get over that. I think it's because I try to picture what the author pictures and fail miserably, instead of issuing every character and place its own characteristics according to my imagination.  I'm trying to do more of that imagining stuff. So, I'm reading LOTR for three reasons: 1, because I'm tired of feeling like an idiot and saying that I have trouble reading the books. B, because I want to read the books and all. And III, because I'm  tired of people watching the movies then claiming to be fans because it's trendy.   Honestly, face it! LOTR is trendy now. It's popular, it's up there. Something once reserved to geeks is now a nationwide phenomenon. I don't have a problem with fantasy or LOTR or geekhood at all, mind you, but it's stupid how people are getting into it just so they can fit in. The movies are great. They're epic, they're detailed, the acting is great, the fantasy comes to life. I don't have a problem with the movies. Get that out of your head right now: I have nothing wrong with LOTR. And I don't have anything wrong with people who watch the movies and become fans through those movies. But many people I know are only into it because their friends are. They claim to be fans, but it's only a front so people will like them. This is why I want to read the books. Before I get into the movies, I want to read the books. It's an American stereotype to watch the movie instead of the book, and I don't want to fall into that stereotype. Movies are wonderful, but they shouldn't replace the book they're based on. In my humble opinion, before you go spouting off about how huge of a fan you are of the LOTR series, you have to have at LEAST a DESIRE to read the books. Josh is a big LOTR fan, but he hasn't read the books. However, he WANTS to read the books. That's an entirely different story. If you're going to be a fan, be a fan of the whole thing, and not just the movie because the movie is trendy and all of your friends like it!  ...huff, huff...  ...I'm going back to reading.One final curve     Current Song: "The Stranger," Billy Joel   Current Mood: ...     Well, 2003 has thrown one last hurdle right at my face. While talking to Jessie and Mewd, I hit that little switch next to my CD-ROM drive that ejects the drive from the laptop, which always throws my computer into an instant suspend, and when I take it out of suspend, it's frozen.  Now, this has happened. Often. And when it does, I just unplug it, take out the battery, then put both power sources back in and reboot it.  Not this time.  The laptop no longer turns on. The light'sll go on and the hard drive will start to creak, but that's the end of it. Monitor never even turns on. I don't know why. Judging from the circumstances, it doesn't look like a virus or anything. For one, this has happened before, just... not for quite this long. Two, this happened because of my hitting the switch. I think it might just be because the computer is a bit overheated -- I always put it in suspend and never in shut-down, and just restart when I have to. Else, I don't know. I have the battery out and the power unplugged. I'll plug it back in later.  At the end of November, I had to reformat thanks to a software problem in which my sound poofed away. As such, I have everything from April 26th up till November 26th saved. 800mb of backup on the PC. Unfortunately, everything from November 26th up 'till now is gone. My SNES ROM collection, for instance. Oh, and  my website.  Yeah, that's gone too. Not to mention my progress in Riven and GK2, and countless other trinkets I've downloaded since. Remember that save file I never told you about where I had almost beaten Zero Wing in Round Three? Gone. This is a major letdown.  No, can't let that mindframe get a hold of me. I WILL fix that laptop. I don't know how, but it will get fixed. Somehow. Anyhow. It will. It must. It has to.  And no, I'm not going to apologize to you, 2003. I'll let 2004 be the year I fix it.The end of an era     Current Song: "Bob," Weird Al   Current Mood: Pensive     Well, I'm feeling a lot better today than I was last night. I don't know what got over me. Jessie left to take a shower, and the whole time I just stared at her IM, waiting for her to come back, while listening to Dark Side of the Moon. I tried to pull myself away, but I just kept staring... and staring... and staring... and... augh! I got depressed! Help! Help! Getitoff!  Anyway, I didn't start this entry to write that. I came to write about 2003.  First off, the obligatory paragraph entitled "Where Did the Time Go (I'm Getting Old)" that starts these kinds of posts.   Where Did the Time Go (I'm Getting Old)   Well? Where DID it go? You know, 2003's been awfully funny. It seems like the year zipped by. I feel like I just took down the Christmas tree at the end of last Christmas. I feel like my dad just married my stepmom. I feel like I just had that sixteenth birthday party. I feel like I just saw my uncle at the Super Bowl party two months ago. And yet, at the same time, I feel like 2003 shouldn't be ending. Seriously. I feel like it's been 2003 for ages, and that it shouldn't change just yet. Why? I don't know. That's why I'm ranting about it. This year feels so funky.  Now, on to the meat of the blog entry:   What a freakin' year.   Lessee... 2003. What all happened? Well, my dad got married to my stepmom in Februrary. I turned sixteen in April. I got my domain name (mwahaha). Well, first I moved to ShadowOnline. THEN I left it and got my domain name. I had a job, for three weeks, then I got fired. Steve came to visit for a few days and put me to shame in Smash Bros. Melee. And most importantly, on June 23rd, Jessie and I started dating. It's been six months since we started now... wow. THAT shot by, fast. Hmm. Really fast.  Well, we're about to head out to dinner at the Olive Garden now. I still have to write a letter to Jessie telling her that I might not be on till later. Anyway, that's my featureette on 2003...  see you next year, hosers!   *sets up a bomb next to 2003*I'll see you on the dark side of the moon     Current Song: "Eclipse," Pink Floyd   Current Mood: Melancholy     I don't feel all that great right now. Dunno why. Just down.  All that you touch All that you see All that you taste All that you feel All that you love All that you hate All you distrust All that you save All that you give All that you deal All that you buy Beg, borrow or steal All you create All you destroy All that you do All that you say All that you eat Everyone you meet All that you slight Everyone you fight All that is now All that is gone All that's to come And everything under the sun is in tune But the sun is eclipsed by the moon.The lunatic is in my head     Current  Song:  CD: "The Dark Side of the Moon," Pink Floyd   Current Mood: Very, very lost     What? Who? Me? No. You? Why? Sure. Huh? Oh. No. No! Wait. What?  Exactly. I've been listening to The Dark Side of the Moon for hours tonight, and it's really getting to me. The music is... confusing. I feel lost. It's entrancing, and VERY eerie. Compelling, too. I'm quite lost. Didn't I already say that? Oh. Yes. Right.  Hmm.It's December 29th! You know what THAT means.     Current Song: n/a   Current Mood: Relieved     What does it mean? That it's December 29th, of course.  Yaargh. At 9:20 or so, tragedy struck: a stinkin' search page screwed over Internet Explorer. I couldn't visit any websites -- anything I'd stuff into my Address bar would be disregarded and instead would take me to the same search page. I virus-scanned. I ad-awared twice. I reinstalled IE6. I mucked about in the registry. At 10:30-ish, I left to watch My Cousin Vinny with mom -- such a great movie. (Thanks, Steve!) 12:50 I came back, and went back to it. And about fifteen minutes ago -- around 2:40 -- I solved my dilemma. As it turns out, I wasn't scanning deep enough into the registry. I found a bunch of wmmse.com strings in there, so I deleted all of them. Stupid things.  Of course, in the process, I accidentally killed the string that told IE to put http:// in front of a URL by default. So while I solved one problem, I had another to deal with. Another reinstall of IE fixed it easy, though.  So, Merry Christmas, everyone! Christmas was wonderful for me. Remember that webspace ordeal I had in my last post? Well, for Christmas, my brother gave me a great gift -- he ordered a premium webhosting package for me. I now have 50mb of space, 10gb bandwidth, and a ton of extra features, including PHP and all that jazz. The best part about it? Mwahaha -- the fact that my new URL is  urlLink www.thedelispick.com . Yes, I have a dot com. I'm rearranging the site again -- my last redesign is way too heavy on the tables, and I want a different look. That one doesn't satisfy me. It's sort of the same, just... just... different. You'll see. Eventually.  Anyhow, I'm back to watching the Cosby Show marathon and working on my site. Stupid wmmse.com... stealing half of my night...Aaaaaaaargh     Current Song: n/a   Current Mood: Half-asleep     It's seven am... I just woke up from two nightmares. Urgh. I decided to go to bed on time last night, and ended up waking up around four or so. I was pretty thirsty, so I had some orange soda. I woke mom up, talked to her for a minute, then came back in and laid down at 4:20. I turned on the TV -- Three's Company was on until five. Good. Closed my eyes.  I couldn't fall back asleep. I laid there with my eyes closed for quite a while, but my stomach had decided to just sort of rumble for a little while. I just could NOT sleep. Eventually around 5:30 I drifted away.  I don't know when I woke up next -- somewhere in the 6 o'clock area. I had dreamt that the house and building behind me had caught on fire, and mom was out of the house. I panicked. I could FEEL the panic, even in my dream. I tried to call 911, but every time I picked the phone up, the dial tone would fade immediately. The phone lines were getting screwed up by the fire. I couldn't get online, or call the police, or anything. All I could think to do was to try and relax and play something on my PS2. I went outside, and my family was on the back porch, with firemen dressed in casual clothes working on the fire. Everything was just fine, but I was really nervous and all now, probably because in my dream my house was all rearranged and so it wasn't familiar to me. That's when I woke up.  Fell right back to sleep. That dream wasn't bad. This one was worse.  I was at Cody's house, and a lot of other people were there, mostly friends of ours. I sat down at a table with Cody and two others, and used the computer stationed there to check my mail. I opened Yahoo! Mail, and it was all weird -- this odd orange scheme. Instead of it saying that I had mail, however, it said this: "Changes made successfully: 1." I thought something was up, so I clicked on the one. It said "password changed." ...I hadn't changed my password. I went to make sure it was the same, and I got a long, huge page. There were tons of subsequent pictures with words on them from the female hacker who had changed my password. It started with an obviously fake error message saying that somebody had gotten my pasword, and then had some more jumble. Some said things like "Don't say some stupid prayer, like 'God please help me' or any of that crap" and whatnot. I was panting hard as I read it all, and was freaking out. I kept saying aloud, "My password, they got my password!" but nobody really seemed to care. Cody just shrugged at it, and everyone else was uninterested. Again, I was in a panic. I couldn't make sense of anything. After all, somebody had gotten into my mail account and changed everything around. Actually, it was all as if getting and changing my password was like giving me a virus, with the way the pictures were displayed. It surely doesn't seem like much of a nightmare to you, the reader, but man, it scared the pants off of me.  I woke up breathing heavily and sweating. I was so glad it was a dream. When my head cleared, I remembered what Yahoo! Mail actually looked like and was a bit relieved. After that, I just had to get into Blogger and write all of this down in my blog. It was my best way of having the dream written down and being able to tell anyone who cares, later on in the day. At any rate, it's 7:26 now and I want to play Castlevania a little before school. Have a good day, everyone.I am the smell of fear.     Current Song: "Drive," Incubus   Current Mood: Relaxed     I haven't done a lot at all in the past few days. Well, I got my site up, and I'm working on getting Between Adventures back. Go check out my site, I'm VERY proud of it --  urlLink http://www.thedelispick.com . And go sign my guestbook. I'd appreciate it, thanks.  One last thing. Please pray for my brother. He's going to Las Vegas for a business convention, and he'll be there for eight or nine days. Thanks.Waltz waltz waltz waltz waltz      Current Song: "Anything by Strauss," Because Waltzes are Cool   Current Mood: Beethovey            urlLink Take the Dead German Composer Test!Bureaucracy!      Current Song: "The Coronation," Falconer   Current Mood: Sick?     I came home early from school yesterday with, supposedly, a stomach virus. It's been going around. Your stomach feels as if you're very worried or really guilty about something -- hunger pains but no appetite. From then on, you enjoy a couple glorious days of discharge, with either diahhrea or vomiting. I had the symptoms. Came home at 11 yesterday afternoon, ate a sandwich, and felt just fine. So I slept. I woke up a couple hours later, called Jessie, messed around a bit afterward, etc. My teacher called sometime last night; they cancelled school today. (When your school contains 16 students, it's easy to get an epidemic going strong.) So I had a nice day off. Furthermore, apparently many are STILL sick, so school was cancelled AGAIN tomorrow. Thus, I get a weekend within a week. I'll have one day of school, then two days of weekend. Mmm-mm.  I've been playing Douglas Adam's Infocom adventure game, Bureaucracy, as of late. The game is very funny, yet pretty hard, but it's one of the only interactive fiction titles I can get into. (Surprising as Cody and I used to make these things all the time in eighth grade.) It's a fun game, nonetheless, full of confusion and annoyances and featuring a llama and a one-winged macaw.  (For those who noticed the Spider-Man 2 template, it's gone now. Why? Because it was annoying.)  And so I end this post with a quote from last night's Conan...  "Ohhhh, what happened? Ohhhh, what happened? Ghandi happened! Goodbye."A Monday for the Masses     Current Song: "The Luckiest," Ben Folds   Current Mood: Choked up      Warning. This post contains mushy romance stuff. If you don't like it, blaeh to you.   Tonight, Jessie spent hours working on a slideshow featuring pictures of the two of us with romantic captions set against "The Luckiest" by Ben Folds, which we sort of consider to be our song. She spent a lot of time fixing it up and creating it and putting it together, but after it was done, she had problems sending the .exe. It wouldn't open for Mewd (whom she tested it on) or myself but it was opening just fine for her. We spent another couple hours trying to resolve the problem. She searched Photostudio 2000 for some kind of help or option or preference and I went as far as to download a couple trial versions of the program, all in an attempt to be able to open the file.  As it turns out, she had to send EVERYTHING -- the MP3 and pictures and all -- with the .exe. After she did this, I started it up, and learned for the first time what it's like to cry from happiness. It was amazing. The words were very touching, and the pictures seemed to fit the words. I won't go on and on about this, as I'm sure you, as the reader, don't care -- but it's my blog and I'm gonna write about things I want to write about, so there.  Aside from that, noooot too much else happened today. So... so... I'm done with this entry. Bye.The Expert Art of Stick Figures     Current Song: "The Coronation," Falconer   Current Mood: Exhausted     Things lately have been a bit quiet. Nothing really exciting has happened before today.  Earlier, I found something incredibly interesting. At the  urlLink Janitorial Times , a fellow by the screenname of TheRisingSun had posted a fix for the SCI timer bugs in the old Sierra games, available  urlLink here . For those of you who know what I'm talking about, go check it out -- instead of slowing down your system with Turbo or Moslo, this is actually a patch for the games. You unzip the patch that applies to each game into its directory, then play it, and the timer problems are instantly solved! No more waiting forever for the elevator in Leisure Suit Larry 3! Space Quest 4, one of the buggiest games in Sierra's history thanks to the screwy time, works like a charm!  The desert in Space Quest 1 VGA is actually playable!!  As I write this post, he's only got a fix for SQ1VGA, SQ4, SQ5, SQ6, LSL3, LSL5, and PQ3, but as soon as he can get a copy of QFG4 he's going to patch that game as well. I'm sure he's also got other things planned. Either way, these patches really honestly fix the games. The timer problems become nonexistant, from serious problems (SQ4's Droid o'Death, Skate-o-Rama, Sequel Police, etc.) right down to animation problems (SQ1VGA's constant head-swivelling, super-fast cartridge retrieval droid bouncing, etc.). It's like a miracle cure, only it really IS a miracle cure! Sierra fans with timer issues, check the patches out!  Secondly, Mewd and I buckled down and got to work on Sandwich Quest today. I decided that to get more work into my projects, I'm going to base my focus on one project and stick to that instead of bouncing back and forth between games. I decided that the one solo project I have that I want most to do is The Quest for the Meaning of Life. As such, MOL is my main goal right now. Well, kind of. I want to focus my solo effort on MOL, but I want an equal emphasis on Sandwich Quest. Basically, instead of having several projects, I have two that are what I want done most, and those're what I'm going to stick to.  Anyway, yeah, Mewd and I did a lot of work on Sandwich Quest today. I had accidentally deleted the original file back a few months ago when we were working on it, and so I started rebuilding it today. We didn't have much anyway, and all the stuff that was in the file was still on my hard drive, so I managed to keep all the art and stuff. I have the entire first room rebuilt; aside from that, I have the kitchen scene done and ready to be made into a room, and Mewd already has a lot of the descriptions written. Basically, I've pushed myself all night, and it's paid off. I'm proud of what all we have, even if it isn't a lot just yet.  However, it's 5:53 in the morning, and I'm going to bed! I emailed Jessie a half hour ago as I usually do and said that I was going to bed, and then I decided to update my blog, and here it is, six in the morning, and why am I still up? Sheesh, you'd think I was some kind of freak.I AM dexterity.     Current Song: "December," Weezer   Current Mood: I dunno, anxious?        I did it in   1    seconds. I deserved an A++!!

Current Song: "Substitutional World," Falconer   Current Mood: Happy     I dreamt last night. And it was a weird dream.  I think I was in some kind of game. But it was all very realistic. I think I was kind of like Dante, from Devil May Cry. I was near the end of the game, as it was really short. I told mom that I was just going to leave and go back to doing something else, but as I was walking down this long hallway to leave, I had a feeling that my arch-nemesis would show up -- and he did.  He fell from the ceiling in front of me. I don't remember much about his appearance except that he had these glowing white eyes, and strong, last-boss-like red and black armor.  We then fought. It was a REALLY taxing battle. He had very strong attacks, but I could block all of them with ease. But I could never hit him.  He would spawn these... zombie things. Only they were zombies also wearing red and black armor. They were tall and very thin, and I really couldn't do much damage. I kept on pushing them out of the way, hitting them against walls, elbowing them and the like. I guess eventually I'd kill them, but I was juggling between then and the boss.  I kept trying to figure out how to kill the guy, but I couldn't. I think I had a sword and a gun. Well, I know I had a gun. I could never harm him. He'd do this huge dash, then leap a couple times into the air and wail on me with a huge combo, but I would block it. When he would run back to the center of the hall, I'd attempt to run and hit him with a clothesline with my sword.  I thought this was effective, but I don't think it was doing much. Finally, after a long battle, I managed to get him down onto the ground. I straddled him, curled my fingers in his hair, and pounded his skull mercilessly against the floor while calling for backup.  A few of my friends came and used some kind of ritual to draw the evil spirit out of him, and he returned to normal. Then I remember drawing my gun and saying, "No, I'm not going to let you live," and trying to shoot him, but the gun wasn't firing because the game was over.  And then, I woke up.  I also had a short dream about Jessie before that, but it was so  wild and passionate  that I don't DARE talk about it here. (If seeing her sitting on the couch and reading is wild and passionate, that is.)  Anyway, it's now 4:57, and you can bet your pants that they're going to be calling soon for us to go to dinner. So until they do, I'm going to continue listening to Falconer. I've spent the past ten or fifteen minutes getting my blog to publish onto my website, instead of on blogspot.com. However, Blogger can be an unfunctional piece of crap, and so it isn't working. I'll just stay on Blogspot. It's not that bad. And it's a heck of a lot easier than fighting this thing.You shall be slain; all of you!      Current Song: "Just a Phase," Incubus   Current Mood: Fired up     I'm going to be performing tomorrow morning in church: a dramatic recital of Psalm 62.   Truly, my soul waiteth upon God. From him cometh my salvation. He only is my rock AND my salvation. He is my defence; I shall NOT be greatly moved.  How long will you imagine mischief against a man? You shall be slain; all of you! As a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a tottering fence! They only consult to cast him DOWN from his excellency! They delight in lies! They bless with their mouth, but they CURSE inwardly!  My soul, wait thou ONLY upon God, for my expection is from him. He only is my rock and my salvation. He is my defence. I shall NOT be moved. In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.  Trust in Him at all times; ye people, pour out your hearts before him! God is a refuge for us. Surely, men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity. Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery! If riches increase, set NOT your heart upon them! God has spoken once, twice have I heard this -- that power belongeth unto God!  Also unto thee, o Lord... belongeth mercy; for thou renderest to every man according to his work.   I especially like the second paragraph. I get loud, forceful, and convicting with my words. For now though, I depart; I'm gonna get a quick haircut then come back and play more of Gabriel Knight 2. It's really heating up. Anyway -- gotta run. So long.Episode 263: "Soliciting Prayers"     Current Song: "That's Life," Frank Sinatra   Current Mood: I think I'm still shaking     Just earlier I had a discussion with Kat about God. Kat, if for some reason you're reading this entry, I apologize for keeping you for so long after you first stated that you were going to leave, but I really thought it was important that I speak to you about God. There is so much I have left to say, and so many things I wish I would have said differently -- it's a struggle to pick and choose what you want to say in the flash of an instant -- but I hope what I said had some effect on you. If ever you need to speak to me about God, if you ever feel compelled to go one step over what you've learned in all your therapies and whatnot, to lean over the calice you've built up toward God, IM me. Please, IM me. I'm more than willing to help you and encourage you. I guess all I can say is one thing Mewd mentioned: there's a big difference between religion and God, and though your religion wronged you, God is completely different -- and from what you told me, entirely contrary to what you were taught. God loves you; I love you. Come to either of us and we'll help you. I really don't want to sound pretentious, but I would just like to stress how important it is to me -- somebody that barely knows you -- that you wind up with peace in your heart.  I won't go into details -- here I am, writing in a public blog about somebody else's personal life. I'm not saying any of this to embarrass her; rather, to rally a call for action. My Christian friends, please, PLEASE keep Kat in your prayers. You may or may not know her -- probably not. Still, God'll hear you. Please pray for her. Pray that she recovers from her ailments, though most aren't things that can just fade away. Pray that she learns the truth about the Lord, and His plan of salvation for us. Most of all, pray that she accepts Him in time, that she finds that He really is the closest confidant one can have. Again, not trying to embarrass her or pry into her business -- far from it. I'd just love to prove to her that God and His followers DO care about her, and the 'cruelty' she saw in Him was an object of the devil.  That's really all I can say about anything right now. Aside from my girlfriend's birthday and my horrendous pile of a day at school yesterday, nothing terribly exciting has happened lately. Go read "The Hiding Place" by Corrie ten Boom. Great nonfiction novelization about a Christian family in Holland that fell under Nazi oppression in WW2. The author, Corrie, became a "militant leader in the anti-Nazi Dutch underground." She risked everything to save the persecuted Jews from Hitler's rage. Really interesting book. Very inspiring.Weapons of Crash Induction      Current Song: "Loverman," Metallica (Been a while since they showed up here...)   Current Mood: Excited     ROOTERS -- At approximately 9:30PM EST on February 11, 2004, the assault began on the dictator, Error the Fifty-Second.  President Carnahan gave a propagandous rally speech before the event.  "The preparations have begun in our attack on Error," he began, invoking resounding applause.  "Our troops will raid the swamp. They will find Error. They will annihilate on sight. This is not a test."  The operation's treasurer, known anonymously as "Reno," finished paying off his debt to the operation's commander, also known anonymously as "New Rising Sun."  After the transaction was complete, the commander began his ambush on the unprepared Error the Fifty-Second.  At the time of writing, Error is in exile. His land now occupied by the Forces of Good, he can only manifest where he is unexpected.  Sources say that Error the Fifty-Second had many sub-errors, lurking in such places as the slippery slope and near the wraiths.  Commander Sun is confident that the sub-errors will be brought to great justice.  Minutes after the launch, President Carnahan claimed that "A full solution to the evil, vile, wretched beast that is Error 52 is at hand."  ---  Amazing, no? An actual news story. Huh. Very interesting.So new, it still smells like Lysol!      Current Song: "Wield my Sword," Nightwish   Current Mood: Content     I've changed things around considerably. I was getting online to update my blog and noticed a link at Blogger.com about... something about Networking, and checked it out. A click or two later and I noticed something about finding new templates for my blog. Since Blogger.com's supply is AWFULLY limited, and I've been wanting a new template for some time, I took a look at the first link on the list of sources --  urlLink BlogSkins.com . I looked through the templates available there, and eventually, under the Digital category (I was drawn here due to my geekhood), I found this one, liked it a bunch, and saved it to my drive. After a bunch of editing away at the sidebar and stuff, I present to you -- my new blog. Very cool, huh? I love it! It spiffs! Immensely!  Immensely!   (And a bajillion thanks to Steve for hosting that above image while my site refuses to let me into cPanel.)   On to more pressing matters, though! Last night I finished  The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery.  Yes, Gabriel Knight 2, the only game from Sierra's FMV era that's actually good. The climax was a thriller. That opera... hoo, that opera. It had me shaking, not from fright, but from sheer excitement. But I finished that game, finally -- the museum in Chapter 4 held me up  forever.  Man, that was annoying. At any rate, I'm done with the game and am now moving on to Gabriel Knight 3: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned. It's about vampires, and ancient castles, and other stuff --  in 3D.  The interface is a bit cumbersome so far, but I'll get used to it. Also, Tim Curry is NOT Gabriel. Dean Erickson is. I can't stand Curry's rendition of the novelist. Which I make a point of in the sidebar.  Anyway! I'm going to post this now, because I have to, because, I do. Gotta study for Social Studies. For an era as cool as the middle ages, the work is awfully confusticating...Funeral for a Friend     Current Song: (my Launchcast station)   Current Mood: Very unhappy     The deed is done and all is lost; my laptop is no more.  Day after day, I've struggled with that beast. Every other day -- quite literally -- it would develop bad sectors. Its performance fluctuated. The sound card was somehow becoming physically dislodged from the machine, as in the past couple of days it's been suddenly cutting out sound-wise. I've had to tap or hit the chassis of the laptop where the sound card was in order to get the sound back. The monitor was already going bad, and would sometimes display funky lines on the screen. I would have to hit it a few times to knock it back into place. The thing was really banged up.  Tonight, I was hitting it to try and get my sound back, and it just blinked off. So I turned it back on. It would get past my Windows screen, then eventually just lock up. I rebooted, and Scandisk prompted; so I ran a scan. It tried to scan the directory structure but hung at 31%, claiming that a bad sector stopped it from being able to go further. It would try its little heart out to scan it but nothing was doing. I turned the computer off then back on. I was prompted with the menu that lets you boot in normal mode, Safe Mode, etc. I chose Command Prompt as I usually do to scandisk again. Typed scandisk at the DOS prompt.   Bad command or file name.   ...Okay, change directory to c:\windows. scandisk.   Bad command or file name.   Um. Dir scan*.*? There was no Scandisk.exe. Anywhere.  Scandisk.exe had been wiped out.   Alright, so, maybe I can catch a fluke and load Windows. Restarted the computer. Not even my Windows 98 screen came up. It hung right after I entered my hard drive password. Crap and a half.  I eventually popped in my Windows 98 disc to see if I couldn't use it as a boot disk, or just reinstall Windows. It did an automatic scandisk to check for drive integrity. Aaaand it hung again, just like last time, at 31%. I shut down and rebooted, and then copied scandisk.exe from the CD back to my hard drive. At least that was resolved.  However, since my laptop used interchangeable CD-ROM and Floppy drives, I had to shut down in order to switch drives. This posed a huge problem -- I could only get to my command prompt using the Windows 98 disc, and I needed my floppy drive to back up things. I looked around and eventually found my old Universal Boot Disk -- if I could use that to boot my computer, I could use another disk to back stuff up.  The idea worked. I managed to get into C: and grab some documents and images. I'm going to go back sometime in the near future when things have settled down and see if I can somehow get back into Windows. There's a lot more I want to back up. Ohhh, is there a lot more. However, I'm not nearly in the mood to fiddle with it all now. I'm finally starting to ease up a bit. I've been very upset ever since it happened. I really wish I could just avoid school tomorrow and stay in bed, or maybe do something to cheer myself up. Whatever. The whole thing's a mess. I've written too much already so I won't go into my options for room-based personal computer replacement, or "What I'm Going to Do to Get Back Online From My Room." I still have the PC out here, but mom uses it too. I need privacy.  Top it all off with the fact that I've had the menacing smell of grape soda stuck in my nose ever since Tim drank a can of it during our Chess match earlier, right now I'm not feeling my best. I have homework but I want to play Callahan's Crosstime Saloon. Maybe I'll just shrug my homework off for a while. I need something to cheer me up.Ease of Use? On a PC? What!?     Current Song: "I Get No Kick From Cocaine," Blazing Saddles   Current Mood: Surprised     I set about the gruelling task today of setting up, breaking in, and paper training our new computer. Amazingly enough...  Brace yourself.  While keeping in mind that this is Windows XP.  Still braced?   Things worked very, very, very well.   I mean it. Aside from a bad product key which disallowed me from the Office 2003 free trial (which I fixed on the phone with a Swede in tech support) everything's gone smooth. Even my printer setup!  And I've never successfully set up a printer on my first try!  It was spiffy! I managed to even print out a working page! Without hassle! AYAYAYAYAYAY!!  Yeah. I'm happy. The whole thing is wonderful. The monitor's a tad smaller than the old one but that's fine -- it's still a great picture and all. And I can bear XP. Overall, it's spifftastical. Three thumbs up.Chapter 2: Everything Happens for a Reason     Current Song: "Superman's Dead," Our Lady Peace   Current Mood: Happy     Welp, we got a new computer today. One that DOESN'T suck.  2.8GHz. 256MB SDRAM. 80GB hard drive. DVD-ROM. CD-RW writer. USB ports out the yinyang (it clocks in at six, four in the back and two in the front).  It's on like Donkey Kong.   I'm really happy about the new PC. It's very spiffy; very smooth and sleek. It runs things in a very... very... very new-y manner. It's all Windows XP so the bells and whistles are present. I don't intend on removing it; I have the other PC in my room now (which is where I'm at) and it uses Windows 98SE, so I'm happy. Yes, speaking of, I'm glad about having the PC in here now -- 400mhz, 80gb hd, 128mb RAM, it's not as good, but it's still spiffy. It's been the best I've had for years and years. And while now a new computer has overthrown it, it still lives on in my room, thriving and giving me privacy and other neat stuff, like doughnuts.  But yeah, new computer, replacement for the laptop, and I'm happy. Finally, my computer desk has a use!Troubled Waters     Current Song: "Like the Rain," Clint Black   Current Mood: A bit upset     Many things to touch on in this update of El Bloggo.  First and foremost,  The Passion of the Christ  is one of the most powerful, influential, and humbling movies ever produced. The film speaks so much strength and really is a very refreshing event. People direly need to see just what Christ went through when He was crucified, and it took Mel Gibson to show them this side of His life.  Secondly, LucasArts has officially lost about 5,000 fans with their  urlLink cancellation of Sam and Max: Freelance Police.  A petition has risen to save the game from the knife of the LEC Glukkons. It's already been cancelled, but we're revolting in protest of the cancellation. Please, if you have any adventure game spirit in you or if you're a big fan of Sam and Max or if you loved Hit the Road or if all of the above apply to you,  urlLink write them a letter expressing your disgust  or  urlLink sign the petition to bring it back.  This is an outrage. They'll know their mistake.  Thirdmost, Warcraft III is the most fun I've had in a real-time strategy game since, well, since forever. As much as I liked starcraft, WC3 changes everything around and turns the RTS genre upside down. I LOVE the single player campaigns; I'm actually rather good at them. I REALLY suck at multiplayer, though, so I stray from battle.net play. But for an introvert, single player is enough for me. And when I finish the four campaigns of Reign of Chaos, I have the expansion, The Frozen Throne, to look forward to. What a wonderful world.  Anything else? No, don't think so. Go see The Passion of the Christ. You must see this film. You need to see this film.Lovesick     Current Song: "A Kiss to Build a Dream On," Louis Armstrong   Current Mood: Melancholy     The current song is a really, really good one. Mewd sent it to me; it's the theme from the PC game, Fallout 2. I was looking for some 50's-style music for something I'm working on, and while it isn't bouncy like I wanted, it's a very good, very slow song.  I'm really feeling out of whack and disoriented right now. My grandmother, great-aunt, aunt, and uncle are going to Florida for ten days with travel time, and again, they're calling on me to mind their house while they're gone. I'll be watching over my aunt, uncle, and grandmother's house while two of my cousins are taking up my great aunt's house next door. With my cousin David living at my aunt's house, it'll essentially be four cousins watching two houses.  This usually isn't a problem, but apparently, David's recently started to use the computer after everyone goes to bed. Hopefully there's no contention for computer use. Also, since my aunt wants to use AOL in Florida, and doesn't want the account tied up, I'll be installing SBC Yahoo! Dial-Up over at her house, and using that to get online. I may just take my computer over and hook up all the peripherals to it, so I can have a familiar experience over there. With this there, my cousin probably won't be too inclined to use it as it's mine. However, I'm not sure. I'll probably just use hers, and if I direly need my own PC, I'll take it along. I'm not sure.  At any rate, the whole thing has me discombobulated. I've been sick for the past couple of days. Nothing serious -- diahhrea -- but all of last night, I had the distinct queasy feeling that I'd be vomiting. I spent two and a half hours going in and out of the bathroom for long periods of time. While I finally lied down at 2:40 or so, I didn't actually fall asleep until 4 -- I just half-dreamed (you know, that thing where you're conscious, but vivid thoughts are swimming in your head). I woke up again at 7 when mom went to work, and then actually got up at 11. I felt much better, at least. Still, that's the second day this week I've taken a sick day, the first being Tuesday (I had the bug mildly but thought I had it bad). I'm not ready to go back, and I still don't feel all together. I feel like things are happening really fast. And at the same time, I'm really emotional -- maybe it's due to lack of sleep, or a combination of that with the traces of the bug still in me, but since Jessie left about half an hour ago, I've really, really missed her. Maybe it's because the song is really romantic and melancholy or something -- I dunno. All I know is, I really wish I could talk to her again soon. I'll probably call her before bed, as I always do, but... I dunno. I miss her.  Soon, we're going over to my aunt's house again. It's 9:45 at the moment I write this. They're leaving at 5:00am. Thusly, we won't be there to see them off, unless mom and I wake up early. Anyway, we're gonna go over there to say goodbye and for last-minute instruction and all that. I guess I'm just really nervous. I feel very alone, and I don't know why.  Have a great weekend. I'll write again when I'm all settled in. Sorry for the delay between posts.Current Song: "Wayfaring Stranger," Trace Adkins   Current Mood: Tired    Seriously.Current Song: "Whiskey Lullaby," Brad Paisley   Current Mood: Melancholy?    I'm sorry that I've forgotten lately to update the ol' weblog. When I was at my aunt's house, the dialup, combined with the forced 800x600 resolution and ultra-dim monitor, didn't exactly leave me wanting to update.  The housesitting went about as well as possible. Catch an update: the ten days went slightly roughly, with me spending a lot of time cleaning and my cousin spending a lot of time not cleaning. When I'd finally be done cleaning and doing homework, he'd be online. For the most part, everything was alright, I suppose. Well worth the $100 pay, even though I wasn't really doing it for the money. A few days after finally leaving their place, I spent a weekend over at my brother's. Talk about refreshing. I had minimal cleaning up to do and plenty of freedom and aloneness. They didn't pay me, but that's no problem at all -- I didn't expect any money for letting the dog out, eating Chips Ahoy and playing Baldur's Gate. It was more of a vacation than anything.  Now, back to the present. I've had both Whiskey Lullaby and A Kiss to Build a Dream On in my head all day, and I was listening to both as soon as I got home, but eventually dropped off Kiss and am now just listening to Whiskey Lullaby. It's a really sad song, about two people who drank themselves to death over each other.   "She put that bottle to her head and pulled the trigger, And finally drank away his memory. Life is short, but this time it was bigger Than the strength she had to get up off her knees. They found her with her face down in the pillow, Clinging to his picture for dear life... We laid her next to him beneath the willow, While the angels sang a whiskey lullaby."   Mewd once said that he thinks it's silly when people post lyrics, because you don't get the full effect unless you hear the song. This applies. The song, as Jessie described it, is painfully eerie. Definitely the saddest song I've heard in a while. And you know what? I love it. I really dig slow, sad songs like this.  At any rate, today wasn't too bad. The past few weeks, however, have been hellish. My schoolwork is really falling behind, and getting very late. I finally finished another part of Chemistry today -- I surprisingly aced the self-test with a 100 -- but Geometry and English are still nipping at my heels. Once I finish Geometry and English, though, I'm  finally  in the clear. It'll feel good... really good. It's like when you're guilty of something, and the pain is eating away at you, clenching your heart and wringing it out, until finally you confess to someone, anyone, and the pain dissipates. Ashley's felt the same heat I have. We both feel like we're pretty much under the gun -- our infinitely untactful teacher loves to make us feel terrible with remarks that we would readily accept as advice with any other tone of voice. I dunno -- once I get this stuff done and in, I'll feel so much better. Much better.  On the brighter side, I've added two additions to the Compaq -- another 256 megs of RAM and a 64 meg GeForce MX 4000 video card. It's all souped up now, and plays Halo like a dream. Now I just need to get a job so I can buy Armed and Dangerous (the only exception I'm making to my 'boycott LucasArts' mindset -- it's my duty as a Sam and Max 2 revolutionary to support such a wonderfully made original effort at a game). I'm going to take my brother's advice and look into a job at the local cemetary. Nobody would bother me there, and personally, I'd rather be haunted than deal with other human beings.  I think that's enough for this entry, though. I'm going to do my homework then read or something for a while, waiting for Jessie. Heads up, Deli fans -- I have a new design in the works and I'm currently learning the humongously-awesome Inform programming code for making text adventures, or interactive fiction, if you will. IF is my oldest programming passion. One last thing: I've updated the sidebar to reflect current-ity. Catch you later.  > quit  Are you sure you want to quit? (Yes or no.) > yesCurrent Song: "I Believe," Diamond Rio   Current Mood: Productive (!)    Heyo, folks. Ready to blog? I sure am.  Confused by the title? I'm sure you are. Let me run it down for you, nice and easy: I'm wiping away my computer and starting fresh. I've reformatted computers several times; I'm a reformatting  demon.  Let's see, I formatted my computer twice, then eventually got a new hard drive, and I formatted my laptop once. So that's about four fresh starts. Anyhow, this is all ancient history; what you're concerned with is the here and now (or, actually, in your case, the there and then, as you're probably not reading this as I type it, unless you're a hacker watching my every keystroke, and if you are, please bring me a doughnut, I want doughnuts).  Here's the deal. My computer now has taken a liking to the dark side of freezing. It's flirted with such evilness several times, even managing a convoluted fit of blue screens, once, where I could only use it one in four times after booting. It just wouldn't work -- it'd load to the desktop, then, all of a sudden, without warning, without so much as a peep or a click -- WHAMMO! Blue screen! Recently, though, it's decided to itself, "Say, I think I'll just freeze upon the occurance of some random little process deep in the bowels of my monstrous bulk." (And it's bulky, all right. I once found a small child trapped inside.) "Let's see, how can I really ham this up? How can I truly peeve off the Typer Of The Keys? Think think think... aaahhhh... aha! Genius! I'll  stop responding to everything he does,  yet at the same time I'll let him  move his mouse all over the screen!  And while I'm at it, while I'm at it... ohhh, baby, while I'm at it, I'll make a  slow, quiet ticking,  to make him THINK I'm doing something, but then ultimately letting him down when he realizes that I've committed neo-seppuku once more! Whoa! When can I start this... when when when... how about... how about next time he boots! Oh, Gatey," (my computer calls itself Gatey because it's a retard) "you are amazing. Give yourself a pat on the metallic hull, you nutsy beast."  This is the gist of my problem: random freezing. Among other things, of course. My massive 80-gig hard drive will likely take quite a while to format, so I'm going to go take care of that now. It is 4:29. I'll write again in a bit -- sayonara!  -~-  Hey, blog reader! The time is now 7:53, and the formatting is well on its way. It's formatting at about 1%/15 seconds, so that's 4% in a minute. 40 in ten minutes, thus 80 in twenty, thus 100 in twenty-five -- it'll be done around 8:15. There's your Math Example of the Day?, kids.  I have five CDs worth of stuff; three containing data that I'm wanting to keep, and two containing old laptop backups that I don't want to risk losing. I thoroughly, thoroughly scanned through my computer, combing C:, C:\Program Files, and my Programs menu. I found things buried in deep, but the only things I couldn't recover were my Neverhood saved games -- I don't know WHERE The Neverhood programmed them to save to, but they sure as heck don't go in the DreamWorks Interactive/Neverhood folder. Crazy people.  I'm pretty happy that I'm finally doing this. You know, even in its last hours, that computer gave me problems. It developed a nasty habit in which it would freeze for about thirty seconds every time I deleted files. I did a lot of deleting, too. In fact, I even did something childishly destructive, but it felt really good...  You know how, when you go into the Windows folder, it tells you not to EVER MESS WITH THE FILES INSIDE BECAUSE IF YOU TOUCH THEM,  YOU WILL BE TOTEMIZED ? Eheheheh... before quitting to DOS to format C:, I went into the Windows folder, and I  deleted random files!  Oh, it felt wonderful! I drug my cursor into a big box around some files, then hit Shift+Delete and wiped them out. Several times! My Windows folder looked like a post-war street with all the unpatched holes in it. Take THAT, Microsoft! And that! And that! ...And this, also!  So... so yeah. I'm gonna go on ahead and post this now -- thanks for sticking around to read my onslaught of C: formatting goodness. Have a night.Current Song: "Metroid Prime Theme," who do you think?   Current Mood: Ecstatic    Holy crap! Has anybody seen the latest from Nintendo at E3? Another realistic Zelda game! More info on Metroid Prime 2! Just look at all the crap on the Nintendo DS! Holy cow! Ho-lee cow!  I'm sorry, folks. I'm in shock. Pure, utter shock.  The DS will have the functionality of a Nintendo 64.  A Nintendo 64.  And it's a portable gaming system. And one of its two screens is a touch-screen. And it has voice recognition. And it will probably have support for a wireless network for online portable gaming.  PS3? NextBox? Pshaw. I don't care if Microsoft unveils their newest and latest brand of Sensation Heightening Integrative Technology for their new Xbox. I don't care HOW powerful the PlayStation 3's processor is. The Nintendo Dual-Screen is going to do for portable gaming what the Game Boy Advance did for portable gaming.  ...yeah.  Anyway, I would post links to all this content, but I just can't bring myself to do anything but squeal like a little girl.  urlLink Nintendo.com  has a lot of screenshots and info about their latest offerings, and  urlLink Games Are Fun  is always trustworthy for news. Also of note might be  urlLink GameSpot  or something. Just go feed on screenshots and videos of the latest technology. E3 never ceases to amaze.  Before I go, some food for thought: until 2002, Nintendo hadn't released a Metroid game for almost ten years. Two years later, they've announced their fifth since Prime was released. Metroid, Metroid 2, Super Metroid, Metroid Prime, Metroid Fusion, Metroid Zero Mission, Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, and Metroid Prime: Hunters. Does Nintendo know a cash cow or WHAT?Current Song: "Never Loved a Girl," Aerosmith   Current Mood: Giddy    Mewd has a PlayStation 2. Mewd has a PlayStation 2. Mewd has a PlayStation 2.

I'm sitting here at Microsoft Works, pulling my hair out over an English assignment. It's driving me up the wall. I have to write an editorial on some current event, debatable situation, or news item. After several starts, I just can't seem to pull off the assignment.  I started by trying to write about how America hates President Bush, and the world hates America, and everybody thinks we're policing the world. I wanted to take a stance against all this for once, and argue for America instead of against it. I gave up after a few failed paragraphs, though, and now have decided to write about how terribly corrupted America's youth is today. I want to write a moving article about the vices that most teenagers so willingly accept. I'd just love to put together a rousing rally against trendy people with their trendy rap music and their annoyingly "fashionable" clothes  (what is so appealing about the color baby-blue, throwback jerseys, or $200 shoes!?) . Maddox said it best: we don't need 'metrosexual' pretty boys like Ben Affleck. We need real men, like Gregory Peck. I'm tired of seeing all these preppy pretty-boys. We need more lumberjacks and pirates. Men who wear flannel instead of cargo pants. This is what I need to stress in my argument.  But how do I start it?  I've given it more openings than the World's Largest Sponge, but none of them seem to fit. I know WHAT I want to fight; I just don't know HOW. So here I sit, blogging on this  urlLink annoying new Blogger interface  (yes, it's terrible), while listening to Aerosmith and trying to squeeze an idea out of my pea-sized brain.  Speaking of Aerosmith, I just picked up their newest CD today: Honkin' On Bobo. I read about it returning to the band's roots. The songs are all bluesy-rock, and they're very well done. Aerosmith's last CD, Just Push Play, was decent. I liked it, but the novelty wore off fast. This new disc is an entirely different story. The songs are thick and dirty, and have much more heart than the crap running through our airwaves today. (Just where did AC/DC stop and "NoFX" and "Audioslave" begin? "Tantrix?" What? My God, I wouldn't be able to tell you the difference between these faceless, hyped-up numbers if a Soviet threatened to shoot me in the face with a bazooka.)  Anyway, I should get back to my work now... I just have no ideas. I even had trouble writing this blog entry. Everything I say keeps feeling heartless, limp, and flat. Yaarg, I can feel myself digging deeper into the rut with every phrase I guillotine with my backspace key. Look there, I just went back and added a sentence that I missed before. I'm really off the mark tonight. Be glad I left AIM early, Mewd, else you'd get a faceful of stupid remarks and unfunny not-wit.Current Song: "The Odyssey," Symphony X   Current Mood: Quite productive     Triumphant champion of Ithaca! Let a new life begin; this is the end of my odyssey.   I stayed home from school today due to some pretty nauseating feelings last night. I felt a dash of inspiration around noon, though, and proceeded to resume work on my new site layout.  Now, 4:46, four hours and forty-six minutes later, and I'm done and uploaded. I finished everything, added descriptions for all my stuff, and linked up every image and page.   urlLink Go see.    UPDATE: nevermind, not done. UPDATED UPDATE: Redone. Now it works just fine. Check it out.Current Song: "Sonne," Rammstein   Current Mood: a bit down.    Yeah, tonight's been odd. I finished System Shock 2, and it was great -- though the last boss wasn't as drawn out as it should have been. Aside from that, I had a lovely excursion dying miserably in Warcraft III. Lessee, I also watched a bit of the Matrix: Reloaded. Man, that Smith fight scene was spiffy. "Me, me, me." "Me, too!"  Is it just me or do kids suck? A group of three five-year-olds decided to tease the dog today. They accomplished this by pounding on the bedroom window and playing "ring the doorbell then run like little five-year-olds about to receive a bloodthirsty hammer claw in the back of the neck." That game was a blast. Here's how you play by example.  I hear the doorbell ring. "Who could that be?" I think to myself. I look up, and lookie there -- nobody at the door. So I get up and walk to the door, look out the window, and there's nobody there. "What gives?" I ask. Looking at the sidewalk I see three little black kids, two girls and a boy (I think) running from my steps.  "So this is what we're gonna do tonight," I say to myself, and unlock the door. Next time I'll be ready. I sit back down and go back to blasting the Many into oblivion in System Shock 2. Ten minutes later, the dog starts barking.  I get into position.  Looking outside, I find two of the little runts walking up to the front of the house. They stand right in front of the steps and look straight up at the door. The dog is barking, so they know they're seen. Suddenly, one hoots a warcry!  "Boo!"  HWAH! I grab the handle and fling the door wide open. One bugger dashes. The other stands. Staring. Grinning.  I glare. I close the door. I lock the door. I say, "Good riddance."  So after that, they left the place alone for a while. I was still pretty worked up over it, but I probably shouldn't have been -- they were only five year olds. But they were unsupervised! Three five-year-olds, roaming the street, without a single parent watching them. Where were the parents? Why, next door, listening to some awful rap song at volume level 201.  But that's entirely off the topic. Let's go back to the battle. Later on in the night, we get struck again. I hear little feet on the front porch. I get up, and make a quick Solid Snake strut to the living room. I see one advancing up the porch, turning around to look at its cronies as they cheer on its valiant efforts in budding vandalism.  It reaches for the doorbell. PHWAMP! The door flies open.  It stares at me.  The following dialogue is not even worthy of a Battle.net player.  "Can I help you?"  "Yeah."  "What do you need?"  "Yeah."  "Why are you on my porch?"  "..."  "What do you want?"  "I want co' inside."  "I'm sorry, I can't help you."  "Yeah."  "Please stay off my porch. Don't ring this doorbell."  "Yeah."  The little product of unsafe sex starts to run off the porch. No sooner was my door halfway closed -- halfway closed -- when they decide that the dog in the window wanted to be teased.  She's barking, the kids are giggling, and I scream,  "DO NOT AGGRAVATE MY DOG."  I'm fuming. I look out the front door window to see three little cornholes rushing away from the window.  The battle was over, but I was pumped. I tossed on some loud music really fast then proceeded to get offline and brood for a little while. I wanted to read but ended up just listening to Sonne and punching a pillow. I got my frustrations out, then decided to watch some of the Matrix before getting back online a short while ago.  What a fun night!  Before I hit the "Publish Post" button down there on my little Blogger GUI, I leave you with this thought:  urlLink it doesn't get any worse than this.  Notice the Christopher Snow books on the chair, and take note that they were on the table when the cat got up there. G'night.Current Song: Some stuff from Leisure Suit Larry 7   Current Mood: It's 5am. What do  you  think?    So there I was, on my second day of summer vacation, when I realized that I had failed to blog for weeks.  Not anymore. Nooonono, now I'm updating again.  Lessee... what's new... oh, yeah, nothing much at all. I'm on summer vacation, which means either three months of goofing off, three months of working at a job I have yet to discover, or a nice balanced li'l mix of the two. Both have obvious merits. Either way though, I'm happy to be away from school for three months. I'm struggling lately, with work and all. Next year'll be no better, but at least I'll get a good, lengthy chunk of time in which to downgrade myself to an undereducated mass of video games and large dinners.  What else is new... what else... something... hmm, I replayed Leisure Suit Larry 7 yesterday and today. Why do you care? Dunno.  Oh, and I  finally got UHF on DVD.  I'm going to watch it tomorrow. Ahh, Weird Al filmography goodness right there, folks. "This week, on U62, he's back -- and this time, he's mad... GHANDI 2!"  Sidebar has been updated according to my current boringness. And... and I guess that's all I have to say.  Look, I'm not forcing you to read this dribble, you're doing it yourself.Current Song: "Four Little Metroids,"  AmIEvil     If you hesitate before hitting the snooze button on your alarm, are you being lazy?   Good question.  It's now 7:30am. No, I didn't just wake up -- I'm just now going to  sleep.  You know, this post used to say "7:11am," until I  deleted the whole flipping thing on accident!  Arrgh! Twenty minutes, dust! Hrrm.  We got a lot of work done tonight on Sandwich Quest. I finished up the interior of Turnip's car, and Mewd churned out a few more descriptions. This game is really starting to take a great shape. The art is progressing nicely, the writing is, of course, hilarious, and the music is looking quite promising. In fact, Rav informed me tonight that he's already quite a ways through two songs -- Salami Mafia and the tentatively-titled Title Theme. The more we do, the more experienced and hyped up we get -- I'm honestly hoping for a fall release. At least, end of summer.  I had a lot written here, and to be honest, I really don't have the heart to rewrite it. I mean, I had a good four paragraphs -- four long paragraphs. Then I hit control-z to fix a mistake, and it deleted half of my post! Very frustrating. I'll rewrite it tomorrow night, when my feelings of enthusiasm are fresh again. Sorry about this. I'm gonna go get some sleep -- not that I'll be able to; my head is throbbing from my desperate attempts to tear out my hair.  Go read my profile if you're interested in learning more about me. I added a bunch of crap about myself, because obviously, if you're reading my blog, you just  love  to bore yourself to death. Ciao.Current Song: "Buy Me a Condo," Weird Al    Yes, that's right. Tonight, after finishing up our work on Sandwich Quest, Mr. Ravager asked for a screenshot of our work. I sent him a demo instead. When he was finished, this exchange occured.  ElRavager5: ::potential tunes begin coursing through brain:: I it's kewl with you, I'd like to try some concept BG-music... RenoSix: Wait. You mean you're willing to compose for us? Or am I just hallucinating? ElRavager5: I'd be delighted to. It's already very funny, and I'd love to try and come up with a corresponding soundtrack. RenoSix: Whooooa. This is quite a shock, as Mewd and I were just discussing how we wish we could have original music. ElRavager5: Yeah, I'd love compose for it. Most of my recent stuff has been incredibly intense, moody, and atmospherically dark. It would be a great change to do something in the humorous category.  This  rocks.  We were needing a composer. We don't like strangers. El Ravager is no stranger. This rocks.  I can't get over it. We have a team. Team. Team, team. Teaaaaam. Team. TEAM! team. Teeeeeeeaaaaaaaammmmmmmmmmm... teamteam. Team. Team. 4:41am. Team.  I love the sound of that. Not just "Mewd and Reno," we're now "The Sandwich Quest Team." It has such a ring. The Sandwich Quest Team. The Team. Team. Teaaaaaaaaam.  That's all I have to say, though. I'm so happy. We have a composer now! And things are going so swell. Why, so swell, I think I'll post another random chat excerpt. Enjoy!  Mewd6 wants to send file 1-1.wma.  RenoSix: What is it from? Mewd6: Brandenburg Concerto for four Harpsichords, Strings, and Continuo one, movement one.  RenoSix: Ah yes.  Okay, okay,  two!  You earned it. Pat yourself on the back.  Mewd6: Roar. I am Metal Gear Samanatha. Cower before me puny mortal and tremble before my fearsome roar.Current Song: "Sweating Bullets," Megadeth    I changed my layout again. Tee hee. (Remind me to never say "Tee hee" again. Ever.)  Tee hee.  (Ah, crap.)  Let the blogging commence. Lost the old layout. It was starting to rust, and I had to let it soak in the bathtub. I have this odd feeling that my weblog is not at all exciting. There are interesting ones, like  urlLink ToastyFrog  and  urlLink that one that Al Lowe linked to in today's CyberJoke 3000  (Top Ten Worst Album Covers Ever. Devastatin' Dave...  yikes ). Then, there are boring ones, like  urlLink mine . What gives? Why isn't my weblog cool?  I asked a team of real scientific analysts why my blog isn't cool. After much heavy debate and research, not to mention a flat rate of $24.95, they presented me with a fifteen-page report, containing 8,000 words and four charts. Never one for reading, I leafed through it carelessly and came upon one single line that I think sums it all up perfectly.   Your blog, unlike Explosive Mandolin, has no zany, random chat excerpts.   Well, if it's excerpts the people want, it's excerpts they get!  RenoSix: I need to have a random conversation for my blog, any ideas? Ducktor Schmitty: tuna RenoSix: TUNA  My blog just got 21.2% cooler.        And now, for another installment of THRILLING ADVENTURE CORNER!!!1!.   I just  HAD  to write about this. Thrilling adventure always makes for great content.  Earlier, while laying the smackdown on Don Flemenco for the second time in Punch-Out!!, I saw a little figure wobbling by my mouse. A little figure that turned out to be a small roach. Now, we don't get many roaches here. In fact, I've only killed one or two. It wasn't a hollywood cockroach, but a little one that resembled a beetle. They come around every now and then to harass me. I'm sure your house has them somewhere, too. Creepy, huh? Anyway.  I told Mewd about it. He stuck beside me on my quest to find the little turd and maim it. I couldn't find it -- exposure to the light caused it to fritter away at a lightning-fast speed, and when I chased it down with my intense, heavy-duty flashlight beam, it took cover off the computer desk.  I vowed to kill it before the night was up.  Well, just now I was admiring my new blog layout and name, I caught out of the corner of my eye, a little figure crawling up the lamp stand. I muttered a few unkind words, spun around, grabbed the flyswatter, and did another 180 turn to the lamp. It was out of sight, on the other side of the pole. So I struck the lamp to catch the little creep's attention. It frittered around, completely unaware that I'm right handed and I had a perfect swing range. I brought down the flyswatter on that waste of life and drew the flyswatter back victoriously. I think it fell down into my fan and got diced by the blades.  Flippin' insect's got nothin' on me.I'm going to keep this simple: Jessie and her family need your prayers. Thank you.Current  Song:  Video thinger: Weird Al interviewing Eminem   And now, a dramatic reenactment. Playing the part of Eminem, El Ravager. Playing the part of Weird Al, Reno.   ElRavager5: I don't see how you can't not be a fan, ya know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: *smiles and nods* Yes, I know what you're saying. ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: I know what you're saying. ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: Yes, yes, I know what you're saying. ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: ...Yes. I know what you're saying. ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YES. I know what you're saying! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YES! I KNOW! I know what you're saying! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YES! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YES! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: YEEEEEEEES!!! ElRavager5: You know what I'm sayin'? RenoSix: SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUUUUUT UUUUUUUUUUUP!!!!!! ElRavager5: Whatever, man.  There is absolutely nothing new tonight. Well, except the obvious: Rav found, and linked me to, a download of Weird Al's "interview" with Eminem a year ago. Al is a connoisseur of ripping apart real interviews and adding his own bits in the place of the questions. This makes for the greatest interview of Eminem, ever.  "Well, I've been asking all the questions here, are there any questions you want to ask me?" "Y'know, how many times can you rhyme, 'tearin' me apart, breakin' my heart'?" "Well, let's see. Homer and Bart, medical chart, strawberry tart, served ala carte, back to the start, post-modern art, plastic lawn-dart, missing a part, Humphrey Bogart, lighting a fart, and blue-light specials each day at K-mart. ...Eleven!"  Man, it's hilarious. In fact, it's so funny, you should watch it, too. Right click this link and click "save target as."  urlLink DO IT NOW! [16mb]   That's really it for tonight, though. I'm gonna go play QFG4 until 8:30. AM, of course.Current Song: "Breathe," Pink Floyd     Breathe. Breathe in the air. Don't be afraid to care.   Why am I posting this? I dunno. I suppose just reading about  urlLink Vivendi firing off 350 employees and, effectively, Sierra , has brought back a sour taste of Chainsaw Monday. Not that I care if Sierra dies, mind you. No, it's already dead. Here's my post at the QFG forum, last chance to see me there so get it while you can:   I'm not that sad if Sierra disappears. Sierra disappeared five years ago. They're not the same anymore and have no value to me. It doesn't matter if Sierra falls off the map; they're not Sierra anymore, just a bunch of suits with a name that commits blasphemy against a proud legacy. It shames me to see the brand on the dozens of mediocre titles they've put out in the past few years.   Though if the forum falls, that IS a pity. I grew up here.   Aaaand I'll just paste in what I told Mewd to end this entry. Screw Sierra. Screw Vivendi. Screw everybody but Blizzard. Feed Blizzard grapes and give them a private harem. But screw Vivendi.Current Song: "Stuck in a Closet with Vanna White," Weird Al    I can officially say that it is our anniversary. Yes, it's past midnight, which means it's now June 23rd. I've been with Jessie for a year. I still remember this day a year ago -- how anxious I was, and how we were kept waiting even longer when her mom and brother were over and taking forever to leave. But it's  really  hard to believe that it's already been a year. Still, it's been a very, very happy year, chock full of romantic moments -- like when my ceiling started leaking in the middle of the night while I was playing Gabriel Knight 1. Oh, or how about when she fell asleep while online and I panicked for half an hour when she wouldn't respond to anything I did? And I'll never forget the time I called her at 5:30 in the morning, apologizing for hanging up on her, when we'd actually gotten off the phone an hour and a half earlier. (Okay, well, that was just funny. I will admit.)  Still, though... a year. I love her very much, and am really thankful to have such a wonderful girlfriend. But enough smarm! This is a weblog. There'll be no mushiness here! Let's cleanse your palate with a random chat excerpt.  MW Expert Lud: Then I challenge you to a duel of honor! RenoSix: I'd rather have a dual of puns. It's triple the excitement, and quads of fun. MW Expert Lud: Hmm... I accept your duel. RenoSix: I hope you realize who you're dealing with. My puns have roots in all of Europe, even Tree Lanka. I have branched out all over the world, and have even had my photosynthesis taken with celebritrees. MW Expert Lud: Well, umm... darn... RenoSix: It's okay if you can't defeet me. I toed you that I was quite a phalange. MW Expert Lud: LOL RenoSix: *twirls moustache*  I played through Quest for Glory 3 last night. I haven't played it in years, yet I finished it from start to finish in a sitting. Deathfoot is now in Mordavia, mingling with the townsfolk and listening to Igor's droll graveyard humor. I'm looking forward to finally playing through Quest for Glory 4, after finally  urlLink defeating the numerous timer errors.   It's 5:50. Why am I still awake? Have a good day, and remember: if you're not in Rav's last will and testament, you're not a popular kid.Current Song: "Masquerade," Symphony X     First off, apologies to all who did not see me online tonight (last night? I dunno, it is presently 6:30am). I spent six and a half hours on the phone with Jessie tonight (huzzah for 'free nights and weekends'), mostly playing GK3, partly chatting. We decided to ditch our 'competition' and, instead, play the game moreso 'together.' She restored to where I was and we started going through together. Granted, we're now sharing our progress with each other and helping each other out, but this is something we've always wanted to do -- play an adventure game together -- and GK3 gives us a great chance. We're restricting ourselves to only playing while on the phone; I still haven't caught up to her 480pts, but I'm well on my way -- I think we're around 430. Day 2, 5pm - 10pm. It's really getting good, I must say, though awfully creepy. SPOILER:  Man, Prince James' agents being murdered was a huge surprise. Jess and I both have theories about what happened. Jeez, that word really gets around in this game -- theory.  There, no eyes harmed who haven't played the game. Just highlight that huuuuge blank space for things not fit for print.  More cool blank space!  Aside from GK3 and QFG5 (whom I have been neglecting, I'm sorry, Silmaria), I can't say things have been at their hottest lately. I've been reading The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy a  LOT  lately. I haven't read it in years, and it's really great stuff. I'm already halfway through the first book in the trilogy (note: yes, Jessie, a trilogy *can* have five books. You're just anal, that's all.) and it hasn't slowed down yet. I'm rather enjoying the book -- and why shouldn't I? It's the Hitchhiker's Guide!  I  have  been in the midst of a problem. A crisis of sorts if you want to get melodramatic. I spoke with Rav about it... two nights ago was it? I don't remember, these summer days are a blur. Anyway, this has really suddenly sprung up, and I don't like it. It's an old fear of mine, really, and it's been stuck on me for as long as I can remember. (I'm not stalling or setting up for some big comedic joke, just giving you some backstory. Like you care.) I've always been afraid of turning eighteen; not because that's when I 'start' on my life or because I go out on my own or because of college or anything like that. I must admit, to all of you who I've mentioned my fears of getting older -- I've been feeding you a white lie this whole time. No, the real reason I'm so anxious and restless about turning eighteen, despite it being nine months away, is because I've always had a fear, a phobia if you will, of being drafted into the Army. Silly, isn't it? That's what I've convinced myself, but I'm afraid that with our recent war thing and all, by April of '05 they'll be needing to recruit more soldiers and thus, will delve into America's lazy, Gen-X youth.  I know, it's a very silly thing to worry over, as there hasn't been a draft for a long, long time. It's just that, well, I've always had a feeling that by the time I turn eighteen they'll be in a war and in need of more support. Jessie insists that I have nothing to worry about, and Rav doubts I need to be concerned. The rest of you I've been silent about my problem to, either because you won't care or because I don't want to bugger you with my petty worries because I've thrown my burdens onto you one-too-many times (this only applies to one of you and  urlLink you know who you are ). I just... I really don't know. I don't know what to make of my worries. The one thing I've been dreading more than anything all of my life is conscription into the military. I mean it. If it wasn't for that, I'd be perfectly secure in my future. To be honest, though? I think this is God's way of convincing me that I need to attend college.  I've shrugged it off with many, many petty excuses -- I don't need it. I can't afford it. I can live without it. I don't want to go to school for another four years. Every time I make one of these stupid, insignificant excuses, I cringe and realize that I'm stalling. God knows this. He knows my problems and struggles. He's also guiding me through them. I have no excuse against college anymore, and I know it. I'm no longer going to reply "College? Nah." It's college all the way for me. I really do need it, despite my reluctance, and it'll excuse me from being drafted. I don't know if I'll be able to afford it, but there are grants and student loans. God'll protect me. I know it. Why should I have any reason to fear? Really, why? The hand of God is covering me and shielding me; His gift of everlasting love, peace and grace is plentiful and mine for the taking, so why should I hold back? It's like the old hymn; "What a friend we have in Jesus, all our sins and grieves to bear..."  Anyway, I don't want to get overly zealous here -- and I have some reading to do. All of you, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Pray for my peace. The more I write and think about my discussion with Jessie over the topic, the more rest and ease I feel. How great God is.I dropped a Skittle before. My cat kept intercepting my hand when I tried to pick it up. I eventually saved it though, so don't worry.Current Song: "I Believe," Diamond Rio    There's some recent confusion over whether or not I am really me. These rumors are false and must be put to rest! I can't have the general public believing that I am not, in fact, really Ric Carnahan as I claim to be. Imagine the controversy! Imagine the slanderous political mud-slinging movies! I don't need "Celcius 4/8" riding my coat tails. I am here to dispell these crazy myths.   urlLink AMAZING PROOF TO CONTRADICT YOU AND YOUR SILLY RUMORS. GO HOME.   Now that that's settled, on to more pressing business. I had chicken parmesian tonight. It was really good. But the parmesian tasted a little like cheese. I didn't like that. Actually, the food wasn't that good. I wanted my money back, but I just got a rolling pin across the back of my head with a shouting, shrieking voice yelling "THIS IS ALL j00 WILL GET!! LOSER!!" Yeah, sometimes my mom is mean like that.  Oh! The little voice in the back of my head just reminded me NOT to forget this time:  4pm - 6pm in GK3! * Hoozah! Hoozah on highest! I will solve the mystery! The mystery of... of the mystery of the GK3!  Also, I lied about that Hamlet thing, Shakespeare didn't write that. I couldn't sleep last night because I was so sad that I lied to you. I'm sorry.   *I just realized while proofreading this entry after posting it (I like my blog to be done professionally, I actually released about 4 patches for "WOW! Another triple negative!" but you didn't see them because they were  invisible ) that I made a really funny joke. I said "NOT to forget this time:" and I meant, not to forget on this occasion, but I said "NOT to forget this time:" and then listed a TIME, and that made it look like I was saying that I wasn't going to forget the time I put down. Hoo that was funny. I think we've all become a better person after I made such a wily joke.I'm on Day 1, 2pm - 4pm in Gabriel Knight 3!  WOO! YEAAAAH!

And now, I have a headache. Thanks, Rav. I'm going to tell everybody that El Ravager gives headaches for free. Heck, then when you start charging for them, it'll be false advertising and the FCC will kill you.  No, seriously, folks, he doesn't give headaches, just stomachaches.  You may have noticed an abundance of references to Rav. This is because it's become a disturbing trend for him and me to stay awake until around 7 my time (4 his time, mwahaha, I just gave away that you really live in Australia, bet you're mad now) talking about random things. Go complain to him that your regular blog content has been made 5% more interesting. I know you all expect bores by the bushel, but as long as I have a friend, I will not give you the bore you desire! I shall not! I swear it! And I mean it!  Okay! Okay!

I was going strong with rapid updates for a while, but I've sorta dropped off the map for a few days. Why? Read on and find out.  First, I should probably explain my last entry -- things are really hectic with Jessie. I won't go into details out of respect for her and her family, but, well, let's put it this way -- her grandma, after some really unfortunate consequences, is barely hanging on to life. She was bleeding internally, and, while she was given a month, she's barely lasted a few days after they discovered it. Jessie's been really strong, though, and I'm proud of her.  This has caused quite a bit of unrest and grief -- so much that progress on Sandwich Quest has halted temporarily. Well, I can't pin it all on the morbid situation in Indiana -- Mewd's been having some awful connection problems and I went onto a Quest for Glory kick the night I mentioned beating QFG3. I beat QFG4 the other night, though, for the first time ever, and am now on QFG5. Deathfoot the Wizard is on the third Rite of Rulership, and has plans to defeat the vile Hydra once and for all! Or not.  Also: I started up Gabriel Knight 3 the other night, and have since been juggling between Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned and Dragon Fire. Man, GK3 is one tough adventure game. For all you sports fans keeping tabs at home (read: 0), I'm on Day 1, 12pm - 2pm. I was stuck for a couple nights (mornings? What a schedule) in the first time block, but I  finally  managed to trigger the next one. I'm having a good time, though. GK3 isn't nearly as bad as I expected gameplay-wise. The camera gimmick takes some getting used to, but it works very well. I'm content with it, and having a blast. It's really amazing the amount of true history that Jane Jensen incorporated into the game; I never thought France could be so interesting. And it's even moreso intriguing that Rennes le Chateau is a real place. And I'll admit, Tim Curry isn't too bad as Gabriel... but  Dean Erickson is still the real Gabriel Knight.  I insist on it. Mewd, Rav, you can say what you want.  By the way, check this out:  urlLink Andy Kaufman Returns   This fellow imitates Andy Kaufman for a big elaborate hoax stating that he's really alive and never died of cancer. It's obviously a hoax, isn't it? I'm glad we agree. Now click on the "Comments" link under any of the posts and take a look at how  unbelieveably gullible  people are. I mean, just when I thought my fellow man had reached the bottom of the barrel with rap music, they go and pull this on me. I'm ashamed to be human.  My closing thought: I'll never be able to ride the Millennium Force at Cedar Point. I'm too tall. Seriously. The seatbelts were designed for dwarves or something, because people over 6'2", I think, won't fit under the restraints. Pity. Oh well -- not like I intend on going outside any time soon anyway.  I'm off to make a triumphant return into Rennes le Chateau. Later, potater.  Epic metal rules!Current Song: "Theme from Spy Hard," Weird Al    It's 7:40am. Remember that bit about having to wake up at 8:30? I actually just woke up an hour earlier. That is how awesome I am.  Haha, just kidding! Funny joke. Actually,  I HAVEN'T GOTTEN A SPORK-LOVING HOUR OF SLEEP!  Bah! Bah bah bah! I finally settled down into bed around 1 or so after talking to Jessie for a while and packing up my stuff. I had my dog with me, and around 1:20, I fell asleep.  At 2, I woke up. I was burning up (why did I put on a blanket with furface lying against my legs and no fan on? Gee I'm dumb) and had a stomachache. A removal of all things blankety and a quick trip into the bathroom relieved my troubles, so I settled back onto the mattress. At around 4, I had enough of lying around and got some apple pie. I ate, drank, and got back into bed. Nothing. Finally, around 5:30, I drifted for about twenty minutes (I don't remember what episode of Cheers it was, so I must've slept), then woke up. I turned off the TV after Nick at Nite went off the air and decided to try listening to my GK3 soundtrack to calm my nerves.  I got through it one and a half times before deciding that enough was enough. I got up, thoroughly angry, and plopped onto the couch. It was there on the couch, with cat cuddled to my chest, that I decided: I'm going to call Dad at about 8 and ask him to pick me up at 12 instead of 9. I need the sleep, man... I NEED THE SLEEP! Holy crap, I am so out of it, but I have insomnia! I have flippin' insomnia! I am extremely tired. I can feel myself flop down into any chair, bed, or couch I sit in. I'm barely aware of what I'm doing. I don't know what to do! I tried everything. I mean, EVERYTHING. I even counted sheep. You heard me -- I counted sheep. As a testament to how tired and barely focused I am, I went from 59 to 100 before realizing that I accidentally gave 60 a miss, then later on, counted from one hundred twenty-nine to one hundred twenty-ten. Come on, look at me! I'm a mess!  But I can't sleep!    urlLink Curse you, Neptune!   Blarg. I'm going to play TimeSplitters 2 while I wait for mom to come home so I can call Dad. I need sleep. I need it baaaad. Hmm, I also need breakfast. Maybe I'll get some.Current Song: Gabriel Knight 3 soundtrack    Yeah, finished GK3 the other night (July 7). Jessie and I both played to completion together, from 480 points to the bitter end. Not in one night, mind you, but it wasn't until around 480 that we decided to team up and tackle it together rather than compete. The game was VERY good, though frustrating often. There were a couple of creepy parts --  like exploring Montreaux's attic, and seeing Mallory and McDoogal slain on the rocks, not to mention seeing those visions and the pools of blood by every murder scene  -- but you know, overall, the game wasn't so bad. I'd say that GK2 probably creeped me out more, maybe because of the fact that FMV gaming lends to realism. But I have to say,  Le Serpent Rouge is incredible.  Man, I feel bad for all you people avoiding the spoilers because you can't play the game. You must think there's something really, really interesting in there, but you can't bear to highlight the text and read it! By the way,  this isn't actually a spoiler, but I feel like being a jerk.  Wasn't that part GREAT!? I totally didn't see it coming!  Yes, yes. Enough on GK3. I actually started writing this post an hour ago, but then I started to get sidetracked reading  urlLink How Much is Inside  at  urlLink Cockeyed.com . Great, great website. It looks like the inspiration from another old favorite of mine,  urlLink AllTooFlat . Pick one and go to it. No, in fact, go to both! You owe it to yourself to  at least  check out ATF's Lion and Crossing Man pranks, and Cockeyed's Paparazzi halloween costume. Science geeks can be fun!  Startlingly bad transition from humorous to serious topics!: Jessie's grandmother passed away on July 3rd. This afternoon marked the funeral. Thanks to all my blog readers, gullible as you are for actually buying into this whole "Ric's life" thing, that prayed for her and remembered her family. She appreciates it very much. I would say more, but as before, I'll keep it at that out of respect.  So I'm going to dad's house tomorrow morning. This is not good. I love my dad and enjoy visiting, but...  I have to get up at 8:30.  What am I, insane? 8:30? No, no, completely true. It sucketh. BUT! I can manage. By the time I get home on Sunday, Rav's package, chock full of all the Weird Al CDs I could ever want, will have arrived, and I'll be basking in the glory of CDs-I-currently-only-have-on-cassette. Man, cassette sucks. This is especially for you, cassette nerds: your medium sucks! Aahahaha! L0sers! LOL n00bs!  Also -- "Weird Al" Yankovic - The Ultimate Video Collection rocks. This is all I can say about such a breathtaking masterpiece of stereophonic sound spectacular.  Anyway, before I go and end this blog entry, a crime scene revealed its ugly head the other day and I need your help in discovering the hideout of the perp. I was here at the computer, minding my own business, when I looked over, and, well... it's gruesome, but... here's what I saw.       If anybody has any ideas as to the whereabouts of this vicious killer knife, Henry the Hellbleeder, please disclose all tips and tricks to me. Murderers of innocent aluminum must be stopped!   Isn't that little supernova flashy effect on the blade cool? I did that myself.Current Song: "Awakenings," Symphony X    I could have SWORN I just heard Dr. Phil tell a lady "With great power comes great responsibility." Now where have I heard that before?Current Song: "Mr. Popeil," Weird Al      And now, for another installment of THRILLING ADVENTURE CORNER!!!1!.   I was lying in bed last night (this morning?) when I realized that I hadn't written about this in my last post, so I have to do it now. So I was on the phone with The Rav last night when I glanced over and saw a roach climbing the privacy curtain on my door. He was of a good size, and ON MY FRICKIN' DOOR.  Now, naturally, when I see one of these buggers, I tend to shoot my glance around my immediate area to find something that suits the slaughter. I was about to grab my mouse's wrist pad to crush him, but then I saw him: Henry the Hell-Bleeder.  Despite his controversy in the vicious murder of those Mountain Dew cans, Henry's not a bad guy. Sure, he tends to be dangerous, and, actually, quite sharp, but he's used his amazing superpowers for good before. In fact, a nice example of this is last night. Funny story: I actually had to pull the impaled can off of his blade because it had been on there ever since snapping the photo. Okay, it wasn't that funny.  So I grab Henry, explaining to Rav the direness of my situation. Then, wielding Henry in my right hand, I slashed at the beast. Several times. Let me tell you, I put medieval knights to shame. Actually, I think it's more like: I give medieval knights shame. I missed. Many times. In fact, I think the roach was more afraid of the thunderous crash of steel on door rather than the impending doom of a sharpened blade swinging above its doomed person. It scampered about worriedly, always in the opposite direction of the last place I lowered the knife. Finally, the shockwaves dislodged it from the curtain and the creep fell to the floor. Mr. Rav witnessed my cunning fumbling tendancies with a sharp object as I sliced time after time at the roach, eventually crippling it. Henry tasted blood as he made a nice, clean laceration through the center of the bug. It was quite a sight.  Of course, the insect was still wriggling, and now it was on the toe of one of my slippers. I didn't want it to get away. It had already almost scampered to safety upon plummeting to the ground, and I wasn't about to mark this down as a missed opportunity to actually kill something with my dagger. So rather than swipe and slash blindly and risk ruining my slipper, I angled the blade and smushed that sucker with the side. Let me tell you, I've never been happier to see roach entrails. Henry was victorious! Viva la revolucion!Current Song: "Gotta Boogie," Weird Al    Technical date: 7/13 Renoish date: 7/12  Hey, sports fans, welcome to the weblog. Today's been a solidly awesome day. You know how I can prove this? When I woke up, there was a cold Coke in the fridge. You know how long it's been since I've had a real Coke? Nearly two months. I had one at my rich uncle's house, but oddly -- and I'm not exaggerating -- the Coke they have there always, ALWAYS tastes Diet. I think it has to do with the fact that he has more money than humanly necessary. You know how I can prove THIS? He has eleven bathrooms.  If I'm exaggerating, it's only barely.  So after inhaling the Excellent Soda Coke (Double Fine fans, accept this generous injoke), I went on to enjoy a way-cool day. You heard me -- way-cool. I phoned up my buddy Rav and proceeded to make his ears bleed for five hours. That was a lot of fun. I've never, EVER taken part of that many Weird Al references via voice. Heck, I think our back and forth reference-battling has even toppled our online reference-battling. Ah, well, what can I say? I'm just Such a Groovy Guy. If you don't agree with me, tough -- Everything You Know Is Wrong. I would stop my incessant referecing, but why should I stop now? Look, I'll Be Mellow When I'm Dead. Maybe I'm just a Couch Potato, but you can stop me by watching The Brady Bunch. Come on, I Can't Watch This! It saddens me that they even bothered putting it on Cable TV, let alone let the entire block watch it on Frank's 2000" TV. For what it's worth, maybe I'm just Addicted to Spuds, but that's what happens when you're Young, Dumb and Ugly -- you tend to Dare to be Stupid and use Ebay even more than Eddie Vedder. Oh crap, Why Does This Always Happen to Me? I'm on a tangent. I'd better stop before I start talking about how It's All About the Pentiums.  El Ravager now hates me.   And this is at 8:30 in the morning!   (By the way, speaking of, my visit with Dad went just dandily. I called, left a message on his voice mail, then held my breath as I waited for his return phone call. He ended up returning at noon, just as I requested -- I then went and fixed his computer, then spent a wonderfully listless night trying to sleep on the couch, waking up every hour to another rerun of Full House. But his computer is mostly fixed! It still freezes horribly, sadly, but I worked around this problem by installing  urlLink Mozilla Firefox  on his computer instead of Internet Explorer. Seems there's a bug in IE or something that's causing a huge conflict with his computer, because when I cut off its circulation, freezing was no longer an issue. Oh well, Firefox rules anyway. But other than that, everything's awesome and spiffy on his PC. Sucky thing. Don't buy anything from Hewlett Packard unless it's a printer.)MysticalDreams83 (3:57:45 AM): I think I might go to bed... ElRavager5 (3:57:09 AM): I hate to bail so early, but I think I'm going to go to bed. Being tired, an' all that... Mewd6 (3:57:52 AM): And now I sleep.  Separate people.  Separate IMs.  What the crap.  (Despite having stuff to talk about, I'm dodging it this post. Why? BECAUSE I CAN! Neener neener!)Current Song: "I Hate Everything," George Strait    Got office chair?  urlLink I sure do.   So Blogger has this new WYSIWYG bit. I don't know how much I like it. I mean, it's actually really great, because it allows for people without much experience to edit their weblog without needing to know HTML (read: wimps). But I demand hardcode-ability! I'm an HTML veteran, I don't need these easy versions. I type out my code by hand! I'm a MAN! Woof! Grrr!  Right. Lessee, I should probably tell you that last week I went to my Uncle's house for two nights and had a blast. Wings and steak by day, movies and popcorn by night. Watched the western  Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia  Thursday night and  Rocky IV  Friday night. Both really good movies. (Great, my dog just got up and tossed her cookies for no apparent reason. And we're out of paper towels.) Other'n that, we had a lot of fun. Lots of good conversation, and I managed to fix all their computer problems for them. I r00lz.  Man, I wish we had some paper towels.  Hmm, let's see, other than that... oh, we went to the library the other day. That was great. I picked up a whole lotta cool stuff. *'s next to things I needed for research for my newest novel (i.e. it was either a book on the 40's or a film noir).   Books:    The Age of Doubt: American Thought and Culture in the 1940's*      DVDs:    The Man Who Wasn't There*   The Third Man*   Monty Python's Life of Brian   Big Trouble   Office Space      VHS:    Touch of Evil*   The Big Sleep*   Detour*   Monty Python's Flying Circus vol3     Exciting, huh?! Yeah, I know, you're thrilled. The story's doing well, of course, though I need to finish up the plot. It'll probably be set around 1948... good old fashioned film noir detective story. No, not a Sherlock Holmes-esque bit, I'm talking  film noir.  Black film. Struggling private eyes, seductive femme fatales, crooked cops, shady characters, underhanded criminals,  blackmail  whitefemale*, betrayal, disguise, and deceit -- the works, baby. Best kind of movie out there if you ask me. A rainy night, a down-on-his-luck private dick, a damsel with a request, a twisted world where nothing is what you think it is... ohhh yeah, my kind of story. It's a thrill to be writing one of these.  By the way, I've only watched The Man Who Wasn't There and The Third Man since my trip to the library on Wednesday. The Third Man is a classic noir -- wonderful, wonderful story and dialogue and whatnot. I'd seen it before, and so I knew what to expect, but the DVD was remastered and all that and presented a brilliant reparation of the old film. I wouldn't mind owning that movie, to be honest. The Man Who Wasn't There was disappointing. I mean, it was a great movie, but some of Billy Bob Thornton's acting was overdone (he was supposed to play a quiet barber, but he played a TOO quiet, wooden barber), and a few sequences were rushed. Awesome twist at the end, though. This movie was the perfect example of the essence of noir: a sneaky proposition, a risky chance, and from there, a downhill mudslide. I felt very bad for Ed Crane: he only wanted an escape from the mundane, but a few baaad decisions made his life turn upside down and then fed it to a kraken. Like I said, it's really a great movie and I have nothing against it -- but I was expecting a lot more than what was presented to me. My expectations WERE rather high, though.  Anyhow, I'm off now. Mewd is typing something, and I don't know what it is. Wait, no, he sent the IM. Nevermind. G'night, folks! Don't go jumping into any spider webs or getting your limbs deattached by a sneaky government contract.   *Inside joke that you won't understand unless your name backwards is regavar le.So I spent today playing with stuff, and the fruit of my labor is  urlLink here . That's right, I made a new blog, but this one is special, cause I'm hosting it myself :)  Yes, MovableType (a blog making engine) is now installed on my linux box, and so is my blog :-D  Sometime soon, when I get a PCI sound card, I'm going to be transplanting computers around. So I'm *hoping* that all my movable type stuff doesn't get deleted, but if it does, I haven't messed with it that much, so it's all good.Taken from  urlLink This Blog  (the Wireless Blog of Jason Shellen, employee of Google).urlLink This woman  posted "what she wants in a man" on her blog... I find the most recent update to the list quite funny (keep in mind, I haven't read the rest of the blog):   "Part XII  I want a big geek.  I don't necessarily mean a computer geek, although those are fun, and it's amusing to think that saying something like, "but I couldn't, because the file extension was .php! hahaha!" is a turnon.  But I like smart guys, I like men who have a clear interest in something, and I really, really like people who have passions - in other words, geeks.  Particularly ones who babble on like crazy about the thing they're into, and then realize they're doing it, laugh about it, and then maybe accidentally do it some more, realize it again, and then talk about something else.

I'm going to put off the promised post AGAIN until tomorrow. But there is yet hope for my underachievement in this and other spheres.  Remember, "The tallest blade of grass, is the first to be cut by the lawnmower."   That was a cool quote. I had to chuck that in.I would like to post tonight, as I have many things I wish to write. However, I need to study for my Greek exam. I really want to look at what I said yesterday in a bit more depth, and clearing up any doubts as to what I was saying. I also want to define the word legalism, as I use it, and as I have seen others use it. There is an interesting contrast.   Isn't it surprising how definitions can make such a difference in arguments and discussions? One can label someone else a racist, and they may not be one according to one person's definition, but are according to another's.   Interesting, but I cannot dwell on this at present.  Cherio.Here I sit, listening to Brahm's German Requiem, reading my Greek notes and cue cards, with young Jim reading horrible histories (a history series for kids) beside me.  The music is divine, the company relaxing, the temperature comfortable; pity about the Greek! Can I recommend Brahm's German Requiem to you all? Well since you can't reply right away, I will. It's a beautiful work.  Speaking of beautiful works.... Beethoven's fifth piano concerto is amazing. Why do I mention it? Well every morning I stick this CD in the player as I drive out the driveway. I'm beginning to judge how bad the traffic was by where I get up to. This morning was wonderful.  I only just got up to the second movement. The day before was terrible, I completely finished the concerto, and went onto the other pieces included on the CD.  Eccentric?   Just a thought my mother had today, (or was it my sister) anyway, it was a good thought. My mum (or sister) said that the church of today seems to emphasize Grace, at the expense of obedience. Grace is popular, but the obedience and holy living that comes with faith (given because of grace) is almost a no no. When you confront someone about a sinful behaviours, you are being ungracious, and 'legalistic', as if confronting sin has become 'legalistic'. Of course confronting sin can be done in an ungracious manner, but it can also be done in a strong, but gracious manner. Grace does not mean God has saved you and you can go on living in sin, and imitating the world. James 4:4 says that whoever is a friend of the world is an enemy of God. James doesn't really beat around the bush! Anyway, that struck me. It's very challenging.Well as Dan has already announced, last night was a sad occasion. The twits that run our country voted in favour of the Prostitution Reform Bill. What a bunch of godless men and women who lead us.  A passage from Isaiah chapter 3 springs to mind.  8 Jerusalem staggers, Judah is falling; their words and deeds are against the LORD , defying his glorious presence. 9 The look on their faces testifies against them;  they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to them!  They have brought disaster upon themselves.   10 Tell the righteous it will be well with them, for they will enjoy the fruit of their deeds. 11 Woe to the wicked! Disaster is upon them!  They will be paid back for what their hands have done.   12  Youths oppress my people, women rule over them. O my people, your guides lead you astray; they turn you from the path.    13 The LORD takes his place in court; he rises to judge the people. 14 The LORD enters into judgment against the elders and leaders of his people: "It is you who have ruined my vineyard; the plunder from the poor is in your houses. 15 What do you mean by crushing my people  and grinding the faces of the poor?" declares the Lord, the LORD Almighty.   16 The LORD says, "The women of Zion are haughty, walking along with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, tripping along with mincing steps, with ornaments jingling on their ankles. 17 Therefore the Lord will bring sores on the heads of the women of Zion; the LORD will make their scalps bald." 18 In that day the Lord will snatch away their finery: the bangles and headbands and crescent necklaces, 19 the earrings and bracelets and veils, 20 the headdresses and ankle chains and sashes, the perfume bottles and charms, 21 the signet rings and nose rings, 22 the fine robes and the capes and cloaks, the purses 23 and mirrors, and the linen garments and tiaras and shawls.   24 Instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a sash, a rope; instead of well-dressed hair, baldness; instead of fine clothing, sackcloth; instead of beauty, branding. 25 Your men will fall by the sword, your warriors in battle. 26 The gates of Zion will lament and mourn;  destitute, she will sit on the ground.Two things made me mad today.  #1: Everyone know on the motorway, where the third lanes goes out the offramp, and it continues for a tiny way, but after that it's two lanes? Yeah that's the one. Well people who drive all the way up that and then push in the queue really hack me off. Obviously their time is more important than anybody else's. Basically it's called selfishness. #2 What is even worse are the selfish people who run red lights. Today, I had to wait two seconds while my light was green, because of idiots who kept going through a red light. (It wasn't as if it were short phasing either!). Not only is this selfish, but it is dangerous. So the person who does this is saying, my time is more important than your safety (and possibly life). Sick. Well it hacks me off.   On a more positive note I wasn't angry all day! I worked from 7:30 - 5:00 with two 15 minute breaks. I was pretty tired at the end. My shift was supposed to finish at 3:30, but the work just kept coming in. I am finding it really challenging, and really hope it will get easier once I'm familiar with things. I feel quite useless at the moment, and to cap it all off, I'm on my own tomorrow, after only three days training in micro. AAAAAAARG! Well at least time goes because there is so much interesting stuff to do.  Jono Camp came around tonight. He is doing the devotional period for youth group on Saturday night, so I was giving him a hand to construct his talk. We had a good time, and managed to fit in a wee bit of counter strike.Ok... in the footsteps of the venerable Daniel. Check this out : -  urlLink Pete and Scott's SoupYay for Tuesday!   Work today was pretty hard out. I finished an hour late. There are so many new things to learn, and it's all swimming around in my head, and I get confused between all the different tests, and sample names, and do-dacky whatsits. But apart from that I'm enjoying the challenge. 'Twas quite funny this morning. On the local intranet, tehy had photos of all new employees at Tip Top, with their names. My photo had 'Bruce Flavell" attached to it. Thus Anita's rather random (notice the alliteration) comment.   Oh man: Today I sampled some of our whares. Very choice. Grabbed a fresh ice-cream crunchie of the production line, and ate it in the lab. My first ever. Very nice it was too. Also at the end of the day, I sampled a fresh 2L Signature Range Chocolate Eclair Ice Cream. And believe me, fresh ice cream (before it's really hard frozen), tastes a heck of a lot nicer than t'other stuff.  Well I'm hitting the ol' hay, because my shift is 7:30 start so........I'm out.Well today I started my work at Tip Top. I'm overwhelmed by all the new stuff I need to learn. 60% of the job involves microbiology stuff - which I happen to have never studied. :) hehehe. On the other hand it is very interesting, and time seems to go rather quickly.  It was cool however to see Anita at work. (Pity she was a snob and took off hehe just joking.) Not only that, but I met the mother of a boy I taught at Manurewa Junior School of Music. The funny thing about that is that I met another mum of the boys I teach at Nestle. It is indeed a small world.  Ok maybe depression sounds kind of major. Maybe 'down' is a more appropriate expression. Sometimes it's nothing you can point you're finger at. There seems to be no fathomable reason for feeling the way you do, but you do feel distinctly down. Weord.   Man I was reading the Jacob and Esau passage today. How Esau got done out of the blessing. Hardly what you would call fair. In trying to see God's "The older will serve the younger" fulfilled, Rebekah and Jacob went to deceitful and ungodly methods. It reminds me of Abraham and Sarah, not being able to have a son, and not trusting God in seemingly impossible situations. This reminds me of how often I try to use man's wisdom in getting God's results. 'Tis a no no. Full reliance on God is hard, and sometimes we say to ourselves "What are you doing God", or even worse... "Let me help you out God". But God is sovereign and his purposes are not thwarted. (What kind of a God would he be if they were!)It's late, and I'm tired and depressed, so I'll make this short.   Youth group was pretty alright tonight actually. We had a new girl along which was exciting. I should really talk about my vision for CIA sometime, but tonight is not the time!  Monday I'm starting my job at Tip Top, so that should be exciting! I look forward to it.   1 2 3 Read my blog, 1 2 4 Read my blog more.Dear readers of my online diary, I wish to apologise for my unashamed (pronounced with an 'id' at the end of the word)  punishing  of the English language in my last post. Special apologies to Alana aka Miss Dictionary.   The only exciting thing that has happened to me recently was going to the optometrist. Oh boy! My eyesight hasn't got worse since I was 18, which is good news. On the other hand, it could't have got much worse.......hehe.  Anyway, I had to get new frames because my old ones were busted. It's pretty expensive, and when you take samples home to show everyone. Nobody likes the ones you like, and they all like different ones, and so in the end, you just go with what you want.   Nato, you don't know how many times I have heard that pathetic joke "It's all greek to me." But ENOUGH ALREADY. It isn't funny after the millionth time. If someone tells you they are learning Greek. DO NOT, I repeat DO NOT say "It's all Greek to me". Chances are they won't find it funny, and chances are even higher that your nose won't either.  Well I'm writing my entry one computer away from Jono, and he stole my thunder about TVs.  But I'm so with him. TV is evil to social gatherings. What's also scary is that we are often to gutless to suggest an alternative (like a game) because we think we'll get chopped down, when in reality, most people are just watching the TV because it's on, not because they want to. (There are exceptions to this.)Well, we're back. The car survived.    Punish  verb - 1. To completely finish off, destroy, use a thing.  2. To do serious damage to something. I introduce this definition, due to the excessive amount of punishing that went on during our time away.   We punished the track in semi dark conditions. We punished the "Pete and Scott's Hearty Tramping Soup".........(by the way, remember to bring the noodles. it's not the same without them....seriously.) Next we punished James and Malachi. That was awesome. Check out James 4:4. After this we punished a whole coal bucket filled with coal, and then raided some wood from outside, and punished that. Then today we punished Jono's shoes, and his tramping pack. All in a day's work. I think Strong Bad would have a bogus mathematical theorem for this. The amount of punishing that takes place, is directly proportional to the amount of pleasure one feels.  urlLink Bogus Mathematical Theorem   On a more serious note. It was awesome to get away and read God's word, discuss it, and pray. It was really awesome, and I am really excited about doing something like that again. We picked some real gems from James particularly, and it was really challenging. It was great just sitting near the fire, chatting, shovelling in copious quantities of coal. In the end, we decided to sleep in the room with the fire, even though it wasn't the bunk room. The rules stated that we weren't allowed to move matresses onto the floor, and so we had to sleep on the floor. But, better to be warm and have a hard floor, than be cold and have a hard mattress!  Went round to my mate Hamish's place tonight. We are studying Greek together at Grace Theological College.  urlLink Grace homepage  I'm a bit behind in it at the moment, so need to put in a bit more study. I will do some more tomorrow.   Faith and Prayer  Jono and I were chatting about this. If we really believed prayer was important and useful, we would do it much more often. It's a life principle; if you think something is worthwhile, and you genuinely believe it, you will spend time doing it. In the same way, if we have faith that God hears and answers prayer, we would take time to do it. I think it's similar to the whole faith and works thing. In the same way if you're faith is real, and you really believe that Jesus Chirst died for you, obedience will follow.    Welcome  Nice to see Anita, (and Hamish) and Alana on board! (or is it on bored?)Well well well!  Last night Jono installed a CD player into my new car. And then we hung and talked, so that is my excuse for no blogging! Very cool to have a CD player in one's car. I'll be cranking up the ol' Beethoven as I cruise around....hehe!  Well today is the day. me and Jono are cruising down to the Pinnacles. Hopefully the weather is only showery. So I went to the shops to get some food for our travels. Peter B and I discovered an awesome tramping mix recipe that is very hearty. Ok let me walk you through the preperations:-   Pete and Scott's Hearty Tramping Soup  Pour in two sachets of continental hearty beef soup for a cup into a billy. Add one thinly sliced onion. Add four cups of water. Heat and stir. Add a packet of crushed up 2 minute noddles, and a 100g packet of dried Continental Mixed Vegetables. Lastly add 150g of diced Verkerks Danish Salami. Continue heating until noddles and mixed veges are cooked. Eat muchly.  When you share this with others, remember it's name. Pete and Scott's Hearty tramping soup. Otherwise it's free to copy.  Well I better pack, because we are leaving when Jono finishes work at one, and that will be pushing it, so I'm going to be ready to roll. Please pray for safety, and also that our time will be used fruitfully in prayer and meditation!   God bless you all.I have purchased a new car yesterday! Daniel approved it which was good. Always good to have a knowledgeable person to check these things out. So me and Jono  urlLink jono's blog  are going to cruise down to the Pinnacles, and stay up at the hut there on Tuesday night. Should be a great time. We are hoping to pray heaps! Should be lots of time to meditate, and pray, so it will be super great.    Procrastination  A poster I once read proclaimed:- " Procrastination - Hard work often pays off after time, but laziness always pays off now.  " An interesting thought. Well suffice to say, I have procrastinated abominably this weekend. I should have been studying my Greek, but somehow it is Sunday night, and I have not looked at it period. Why is it that when you need to study something, your room always looks incredibly dirty. and you remember that you need to bake a cake for work, and that you need to play counter strike, and that shucks you could help dad learn a few computer tricks, and install MP3's on his computer. And then you open a drawer........ oh no, that won't do, it's a bit untidy. Oh well I'll just tidy this, and then I'll do my Greek. Oh good that's done, I will go and get a coffee and then i will start my Greek study. Excellent, while I wait for the kettle to boil, I'll twiddle around on the piano. Well I'll grab my coffee and continue practising for a little while. Mate! That's the phone. Oh joy it's great aunt Agatha's best friends cousins dog. Awesome, I'll have an hour conversation. Isn't it sad that procrastination dictates our times to us. I need to discipline myself. I can do it. I will do it nine times......   Seriously though. I am going to make an effort on my procrastination habits.  I will keep you updated... if I don't put it off.   Guy's Relationships  I feel sad that guys don't create deep relationships with each other. I mean, it's true for me. Up until recently, I have tended to make all my deep relationships where I talk about deep stuff with girls. Now don't get me wrong, I don't think that having relationships with girls is a bad thing, but why can't I have friendships like these with my male friends. This is something I want to work on this year. I think this could be a powerful tool for spiritual growth in us males. We need a real close brother to share everything with.I was going to write a long post tonight, but I will do it tomorrow. I will do it nine times.  urlLink Nine Times   Sorry to disappoint the fans. have a trophy.Oh boy! It's great to have all these comments.... it means that you must be reading!  My job situation is as follows. I finish at Nestle on this coming Monday. Conviently (or perhaps arranged?!?!) I don't start work at Tip Top until the following Monday. Yes exactly! So tuesday avo, me and Jono are cruising down in my new car (subject to Dan saying it's ok tomorrow) to the Kauranga Valley, and strolling up to the Pinnacles hut for the night. Awesome stuff. I love getting away from Auckland. It gives one time to think, and just take things slowly - maybe life used to be like that before computers mobile phones, and so on. Speaking of mobile phones - Who is the twerp that invented them! I mean who wants to be contacted more than they already are! The ways to beat this annoying technoilogy which means we are at everyone's beck and call all the time are as follows:-  1) Don't have a mobile. 2) Have a mobile like my last one where the microphone and hearing piece both didn't work. 3) TURN IT OFF!  Far out! I was reading my passage from Genesis the other day, and found out that Abraham married again after Mrs Abraham died! I don't remember reading that before.   Question: Why do guys find it difficult to make deep freindships.........?  Shucks my mobile is ringing better go........Frustration of frustrations! I am having difficulty getting Madden 2002 working with my system. AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARG! Some of you who know and love American Football will know and share my frustration. It runs like a dog, which the cheat has beaten to a pulp, and chucked the poopsmith's way. It's not good. Any ideas please email me! It's like you load up the game and it's a slow load time, and then in between menus it's like C64 days again (slow) but once you get INTO the game, she runs like Strong Mad chasing after Strong Bad after a swift kick from Mr Bad.  urlLink Strong Bad kicks Strong Mad  Oh well.   Romans 7:21 - 25 So I find this law at work: When I want to do good, evil is right there with me. For in my inner being I delight in God's law; but I see another law at work in the members of my body, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within my members. What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God - through Jesus Christ our Lord!   Yep, that sums my thoughts up so well at the moment.  :(Well my oh my! Look at the time folks. Since the day grows old, I shall make this quick, otherwise the consequences  tomorrow shall be of an unfavourable nature.  Reasons for this tardiness in my writing are few, and good reasons are even fewer.  Reason for taking this long to write:- 1) Had to get a new hdd, so Jono could take back the one he had loaned me.  2) Had to reformat hdd, install dual boot Windows 98 and XP.  3) Had to configure hardware and all that.  Good reasons for taking this long to write:- 1) fhqwhagads was trying to play like - U NO ME!  urlLink Don't get this into your head LouP!    So anyway, hopefully I'll be better prepared tomorrow. On a scale of 1 to awesome.........have a super great day!Read this passage from matthew this morning. I noticed a verse I'd never noticed before. After Jesus healed the paralytic, this verse appears:- Mat 9:8  But when the multitudes saw it, they were afraid, and glorified God, who had given such authority unto men.  It puzzles me. If you don't understand why I'm puzzled, don't worry, because I don't really want to explain it, but if you do, let me know what you think! Is verse 8 from the perspective of the crowd? or the writer?   Man.... today was choice:- At work people kept bringing me samples to eat. I was given a roasted almonds (the ones that later go inside the chocolate). NICE STUFF. Also was given some chocolate almonds - covered with milk chocolate followed by white chocolate, and finally the roasted almond. And then there were the Oompas. I think I'm getting fat! I'm going to miss work.... mainly for the people - HONEST! I really like the company in the lab. There are spme real nice friendly people. (Hehe - especially the ones who give me food!)Ok, a few matters first.  A) Who's the dude that moves to the beat? THE CHEAT, THE CHEAT! Who's the dude that made Scott's blog super great? JO NO JO NO. Thanks Jono - you're the man.  urlLink Cheat Theme Song   B) Got asked for an interview with BOC  today, but I've turned it down, as I'm almost certain to go to Tip Top.  C) I had been seriously considering going to Master institute (a Christian teacher's training college), and I had an interview with them last week. I decided against it, but today they offered me a position marketing, and teaching in their "A Year in the Son" course, which is I believe a worldview course. This would help me pay for my tuition fees, and they said it would lead to the possibility of me being appointed as junior lecturer for the course in 2004.   This all goes to show one thing. God is awesome. I have been struggling to find work, or something to do for months, and when I did find a job, it was at Nestle, doing something that had nothing to do with anything I'd studied. But I believe God has been teaching me patience, and is saying "All things in MY time, not yours."  On the other hand, I have to admit, I don't feel close to God at the moment. I seem to know stuff in my head, but don't feel it in my heart. Another thing I find interesting, on a different but related (hehe) field: What is faith, and how much do you need? Ok let me explain before everyone starts bashing me........  If I really had a full-up faith, I would never doubt anything, but how many people could say that they never doubt? When we doubt, that is a lack of faith, but is it not faith that saves us? So if we lack faith........are we unsaved? My comfort is this:-  Mar 9:24  Straightway the father of the child cried out, and said, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.Well Well!  I had a rather interesting start to this morning. Me and my mate Jesse had to go down and cook breakfast for the Men's prayer breakfast. So we got down at church at about 6:15, and made stuff. Oh yeah. It was kinda funny when I drove down, because I noticed some writing on my back window. Some lemon had written "0 - 60 1000 minutes". Now I'm quite fond of our old silver streak, so when I finally decifered the code (it was in three lines) I was rather perturbed. It's a good machine..... although not known for it's speed, it still is a cool car. Well, I'm off to get ready for church now.  God bless!Just a quickie today folks!  Had serious lack of sleep last night. The neighbours next door (neighbours generally next door, but I was attempting to differentiate between neighbours as in "Who is my neighbour?", and what we generally think of as a neighbour today) had as massive as party. Well it was not so bad on the music front as the bass boom boom boom only went until about 12:00, but it was the yelling and shrieking that was really annoying. The last thing I remember was at 5:20 in the morning a young guy shouting "Help help im stuck in the fu***** window, someone get me out!" Well needless to say, I ignored his cries for help, although I thought of many potential ways I could in fact   help   him. Most of these methods involved pointy sticks, steel-capped boots, fire or directed pressurised water. Anyway that's as maybe. I was consequently late for work, as I slept in, and I think people found me rather grouchy during the day. I really didn't treat people nicely today, and found myself snapping at my family where normally I would have been fine. Hmm, more sanctification to take place methinks.Dude - just to let you know I fixed your time-stamp problem. And 'hello' to everyone else who is used to seeing me  urlLink here . And 'hello' to everyone else who isn't in the aforementioned category.  PS.  urlLink Monster Garage  (Friday nights on Prime) is pure awesomeness. Last night they converted a stock PT Cruiser into a wood-chipper. Simply awesome.Wowsers! Keep the comments up!   Just a quick note to those of you commenting about my early rising. No I did not get up and post at 3 in the morning. For some reason the clock is rather whimsical, and decided that 3:00am sounds better than 9:00pm. Yeah beats me too.  Awesome day today. I got offered a job at Tip Top! So I'm going to give my notice to Nestle on Monday, as the pay is substantially (read heaps and heaps due to very poor current pay) better, and it is a permanent position, unlike the three month contract Nestle has me on. Ok money isn't everything, but when you aren't earning much, and are trying to save for a house, the more the merrier.  Which brings me to a prayer concern. Although I am delighted to have a permanent job, there is a concern for me that I may not be able to go to Japan for an end of year missions trip. I have already committed myself to this trip, and I really feel like I should be going. There is the possibility that I may get this time off, but it is not definite, so I ask that you would pray for that. God is good, and if he wants me to go.I'm already there!   Question...... why do I always turn the radio on when I get in the car instead of praying. Weord.Oh well here goes - boldly into new territory.   The question "why" needs to be asked, as it does for everything. For what purpose. What does this achieve? Well I had a think about it through the day, after being persuaded by others to get my own blog.  There is of course what I would call the Strong Bad reason.  urlLink Strong bad's new hands  This could be used as the megaphone to declare 'I am still awesome.............seriously."  On the other hand as I thought a bit more, I knew that most of you already knew I was awesome, so there seems to be no need in that department. (hehe)   Seriously though, as I thought of a purpose for this, I came up with one which I think is good. As well as being a journal for my thoughts, I intend for this to be a spiritual journal. As I discover things, and as God reveals them to me, I will write them down. That way, as I look back, I can see what God has done in the past, and look forward to the future, knowing the God who has been with me in the past will continue to be with me.  As I thought further, I realised that this is not an easy commitment. I'm one of those keen starters lacking in follow-through. Oh well, let's see what happens. I can't promise it will be a thrill a minute, but it will never be a monologue in minute detail of my spectacularly mundane existence. I'll try to keep it as interesting as possible and spare you the pontificating, and pick out the gems.   Well perhaps it's ridiculous of me to expect any readers. But to those of you who do. I wish God's blessing upon you, and I pray that even a little of what I say may help you in some small way.  God is great!The first post......... ta da!Mum  I have some disturbing news. My mum has been diagnosed with breast cancer. We received the results of the tests today. So now it is a matter or deciding which surgery option to take. It sounds like surgery will give a good chance of getting rid of it permanently, which is good, so please pray that God will work mightily in this situation. Our God is an awesome God, and can do all things.    This and That  "That shirt I'm wearing is like this shirt you are wearing." Sound wrong? Well at Greek class we learnt about near and far prepositions like that or this. It's something that I had never thought about before, but knew when I heard it done wrong (as above). It was kinda weird to think about it actually.    Snippets from Evidence Magazine No.6   urlLink Maxim Institute   Some of you may not realise that at current birth and immigration rates, the NZ population will peak in 2044 at about 4.64 million, and then start declining. Mainly due to the fact that people aren't having enough children. We are not even replacing our population, and are only growing because of immigration. (What happened to the be fruitful and multiply? Are we selfishly disobeying God's commandment?)  From an article about NZ's population time bomb:-   "......The 16,410 abortions in 2001 alone are equivalent to the current population of towns like Tokoroa or Ashburton. Put another wat, they represent 607 classrooms each containing 27 children who will not be starting primary school in 2006."  "Australian National University demographer Peter McDonald puts it down to the effects of gender equality. 'If women are provided with opportunitiesnearly equivalent to men in education and market employment, but these opportunities are severely curtailed by having children, then, on average, women will restrict the number of children that they have to an extent which leaves fertility at a precariously low long-term level.' "  "The Institute fo Economic Research's April report last year warned: "An older, less productive population will be a principle cause of a downward trend in economic growth."  So much for the rubbish about overpopulation.    Speaking Out   urlLink Dan  is hacked off with Maori claims. he speaks out... a little apologetically, but speaks out nonetheless, and it is good to have him back blogging again!   Lately in the Herald, I have noticed a disturbing trend. When people write in from a Christian, or right perspective, others reply saying that the Herald should not print such letters. I believe we will see our freedom of speech lost unless we fight to protect it.   Why do we feel scared as the Christian right/conservative to speak our mind about things? It is because we are slowly but surely being cowed into submission by what is 'politically correct' and for fear of being branded. Well enough already! We have a right to say what we think, just as much as the hand wringing, pot smoking, sandle wearing sections of the population. And I for one am sick of pretending I agree with people by not saying things like they need to be said.   Homosexuality is an utter peversion of God's intentions for sex. It is disgusting. An affair is adultery, and falls into the same category. The people who voted for the prostitution reform bill are godless, and need to repent, or they will face God's eternal wrath. Radical Maori need to pull their heads in, and work for a living like the rest of the country instead of bleating on about past injustices, when 7/8 of their ancestory was on the side commiting the injustice. Maori and Pacific Islanders do not deserve to get into university on lower grades than people from other cultures. This is racism. People who murder do not need counselling or rehabilitation.  People who use welfare as a matter of choice need a kick up the jacksy, and deserve to starve.   I am fed up with the rubbish we have to put up with in this country, and I will not remain silent about it.  How dare people turn this country into a God-forsaken place. Christians arise!   (I do not apologise for this post and will not bow to political correctness. I am entitled to my views, and you are entitled to disagree with me. But do not ask me not to say these things. it is my right of free speech.) God bless New Zealand!The TV Psalm   Given to me by Andrew Macpherson some time ago. I thought at least some of you who haven't seen it would appreciate it.  The TV is my shepherd, I shall not want, it makes me lie down on the sofa. It leads me away from the scriptures, it destroys my soul! It leads me in the paths of sex and violence for the sponsors’ sake. Yea, though I walk in the shadow of my Christian  responsibilities, There will be no interruptions for the TV is with me. Its cable and remote control,  they comfort me. It prepares a commercial before me; in the presence of my carnality; It anoint my head with humanism, my coveting runneth over. Surely laziness and ignorance shall follow me all the days of my life, and I shall dwell in the house watching TV to the end.   Allan's Blog  My friend Allan now has a blog.  urlLink Allan's Blog     Time  Is too fast for me. Thus I cannot post. For in 7 hours I must arise, and set about my business. Isn't it amazing how fast time goes. It's not so long ago that it was this time last year! And when you think of it, doing that 70 odd times isn't really that much longer than an hour or two. Life is short. Eternity isn't. Do you know God?Person of the Week  This week person of the week goes to none other than Peter Boyd. Had a very encouraging cuppa with him the other day. Was good to catch up and encourage each other about respective ministries. I happened to mention how often all I ever get is criticism of the way thing are done in my particular ministry, and nobody ever  comes to encourage. Pete said that it's the nature of leadership to get mainly criticism, and that we just need to get used to it. He told me a story where a young guy once asked an elder "Am I doing it ok?", and the elder said "We'll let you know when you aren't". It's kind of a funny story, but a sad attitude behind it. The only time you hear from people is when things aren't ok. Well from our conversation, I'm going to try to be more encouraging to people in leadership, because I know how much it can mean to get some positive feedback.  Encouragement  is so important, but so often ignored.   Photos From Guys Retreat  Check em out!  urlLink CIA group site    Petrol  I am doing an analysis of economy of the petrols of different petrol stations. I will let you know when I have some firm results. This could take some months.    Desire to Flee  Lately I have had the desire to flee all obligations, and responsibilities, and go hiking for months on end in the wilderness. I'm sick of things. I want to get away from all the busyness of the city, with the pulls of materialism and worldliness, I am wearied by the constant struggle of day to day life in a heathen country, I want to escape, but I know I must stay and fight and uphold God's standard in my own spheres so people may see Christ. Isolationism is not the answer, although sometimes it is all too tempting.   Procrastination Revisited ...... Finally..... Seriously.  I'm still a procrastinator, and I still don't like it. Example: I've been meaning to clear my desk this afternoon, but I have found many other important things to do. Ask me what those important things are and I can't tell you. A lot of nothing it seems. I don't want to be one, so I'll keep trying to not be one. In fact I'm going to clear my desk now. Later.Beautiful America   The man on the television said I need to drink this, and sleep with that, in order to be cool. And you know that I would do almost anything, to be like that guy on  TV. I know that if I had just the right outfit and hairstyle that could be me. Don't you know you can't be cool if you dress dumb, I need to have that 'cause everybody's got one. I think I'll start smoking, that would make me intellectual, that's what I've always wanted to be. I need to lift weights, That would make me more sexual, and that would be good for me. In America it's wonderful, all you have to do is fake it.  Own anything you want, all you have to do is take it. Live for today, don't think about tomorrow, have a good time in AmericaGomorah. What are you looking at, you better not make me mad.  I'll drive by your house and shoot your dog, and mom,  and dad. I don't need you or the Bible or anything to to tell me what is the law. With a good enough lawyer I can do anything in Beautiful America I want to be in America, Okay for me in America everything's free in America for a small fee in America.   I was listening to this song by Five Iron Frenzy today. Maybe NZ could feature in a new verse. 10 points to someone who makes a cool verse that has something about the prostitution reform bill in it. Haha it's not worth it I know, too much time.Doctor Visit  I went to the doctor today. I am now $50 poorer ($18 for the doctor $30 for the medicine). What makes me slightly peeved, is that I have been for this problem about six times (or was it nine times) and spent hundreds of dollars on it. I have a bacterial infection, which keeps reoccuring, and is resistant to some certain antibiotics we have tried to use to get rid of it. Not good.   Comments Amok  What is wrong with the comments? I mean Fridays post was registering '0 comments' but had two, and Tuesdays registered '5 comments' and had 3.  Now I'm really cheesed off.    Congrats  Congratulations are in order for Anita! I was reading the intranet news today, and it looks like she's got some kind of promotion. Well done!   Book  I feel like writing a book. At the moment, if I did, it would be entitled:- "In defence of good old fashioned blokes." Or perhaps I could call it "Real Men - A dying Breed". Or even "MOAs - Men of Action - a dying breed - just like the bird, but back from extinction. Or maybe just "Why We Need Strong Godly Men". Part of this is as a result of my frustration with the increasing number of bolshy (read - obstreperous) young women there are around. But the thing is many of us guys don't like confrontation, and just capitulate at the first sign of it. To all those lovely women who read my blog, my apologies. I am not tarring you with this brush, but merely commenting on a trend I have noticed. Weak guys, Strong women. Or should I say strong women, weak men?   Mind Siege  Buy it! Here is an excerpt from a chapter called "The Wisdom of Man".  "Today's philosophy of education is obsessed with self-actualization, self-image, self-love, self-sufficiency, self-esteem, self-satisfaction - self, self, self. .......Traditional Christianity, Mr Rieff observed, made great moral demands on believers. Its goal was salvation; consequently, it exhorted believers to 'die to self'; repent of sin, and cultivate virtue, self-discipline, and humility. Today however, wrote Mr Rieff, 'psychological man' is rapidly shouldering Christian man aside as the dominant character type in our society. For psychological man - the offspring of Freud and his ilk - life centers not on the soul, but on the self.  Psychological man rejects both the idea of sin and the need for salvation. He aspires to nothing higher than 'feeling good about himself.' Mr. Rieff summarizes it this way: 'Christian man was born to be saved; psychological man is born to be pleased.'    Musical Composition  I fancy myself as a bit of a composer. Purely instrumental at this stage, but we'll see. I haven't written much lately, which is something I would like to remedy. Nothing like working out a funky rhythm. I would love to record some stuff one time, and Jono's offered the hook ups with soud gear so that's the ticket. I'll let ya'll know if I ever get it done.Apologies  Sorry for the lack of blogging. I will try properly tomorrow night. Not that the comments have been flowing in much anyway.

I have been wondering who this person is. I don't know anyone who uses one, and yet they seem to read my blog, making up 1% of the traffic.   Mind Siege  Started reading a good book called Mind Siege. The first chapter was set in 2010, and was scary. It was trying to show what could happen if Christians continue in their 'live and let live' philosophy, instead of getting on in the world and changing things. Will tell you more as I proceed in this book.  God bless you all.Of Women  Haha. I'll bet that caught your attention. But really it's not all that exciting. Well they aren't are they... whoa let's not even go there. I might isolate 50% of my audience. But that is not why I wrote the heading.

Last night at a very important congregational meeting, he reminded us not to be annoyed with people who had made mistakes, and get a them and us mentality. He reminded us that we are a body, and there is no them and us.Weight  Since beginning my job at Tip Top, I have put on 5kgs. Perhaps this is a sign of things to come. Instead of a lean, handsome Scott, you're going to see a rolly polly handsome Scott with a big gut which hangs out over his shorts. Scary stuff even.   Weekend Away With The Boys  We're taking away some of the guys from youth group. Please pray that this would be a fruitful time of building kingdom relationships. Please also pray that it would be a time of spiritual awakening, and application of biblical truths to all of our lives.   Jono's Blog    urlLink A dying blog  Jono's blog is dying. But I suspect a bit of the old shock comment treatment may be enough to resurrect old Trevor.  urlLink My name is Trevor, and......  Let's spam Jono's comments and beg him to start blogging again!   Bed  Hey Steve. I need to go to bed. I can do it. I will do it nine times.Collective Ignorance and Meetings  or  "None of us are dumb as all of us."  It's funny I should post this after attending a very useful planning meeting for the Japan Cafe on Saturday. But this is not a criticism of particular meetings, but just a general comment. So ain't nobody take some offence. Anyway, I was thinking about meetings. Seems to me that many people tend to think of meetings as bringing the best ideas and the best of people together, and coming up with a better result. You know the old saying that goes "Many hands make light work." But it seems to me that this need not be the case, because there is the old dichotomy of sayings. One the one hand, "many hands make light work", but on the other, "too many cooks spoil the broth." Could it not be possible that fallible sinful humans meet together, and their worst ideas combine to produce the worst outcome? Sure I hear you say.... look at parliament. Exactly. But then did I ever say I thought democracy was the way to go. We need a Scotocrocy. The rule by Scot. But that is by the by. My theory on meetings is fairly simple really. A short meeting is a good one. Not only that, the fewer people the better.    The Flood  The flood was a localised one. It was not worldwide. It was not even factory wide. It was localised to the chemistry and microbiology lab. Oh yes that's right. The laboratory flooded today. Did it flood at 2:05 when I would have been gone? No not at all. Did it flood at 1:55 when I was just about to go? Ahhhh.... yes. I was washing the dishes when one of the technicians commented that someone had spilt water over near her bench. It soon became clear that it was more than a spill. That became clear when it started gushing out from the bottom of the wall on both sides, and coming out the lino. Yes it was spectacular. Apparently a pipe had burst inside the wall. Well we got an engineer down, who took a look and said. "Oh that's not good." Yes exactly. I can say that and I'm not an engineer. And then he said. "It's coming from inside the wall." Well so it was. But he was actually quite a legend, and managed to shut the flow off by going off somewhere. Well me and one of the other technicians scouped it up in containers into a big 20 litre bucket. We kept a tally, and worked out after the clean up that we had pulled up over 500 litres of water.Ok. I need to set a few things straight. My feathers have been ruffled due to a few fowl accusations which have been flying about. These accusations have mainly been centered on the size of the poultry I consumed last night. Accusations have been made indicating the paltry nature of this specimen of poultry. Now I don't really want anyone thinking I'm chicken or anything, so I have a message for those turkeys. It was a big one! So stop hen pecking me.    Hmm I really had to get that out of my system. Sorry. Well I'm about to go to bed, as I'm on the 6:00 shift this week, and as up until recently, 5:00 am hasn't been on my list of reasonable waking hours.   Oh yes. Welcome to Priscilla! Even though you mocked my butter mince.   (Note to self - remember to post about collective ignorance and meetings.)Just a quickie tonight. Man I was so hungry tonight. I went to woolworths, and bought a whole chicken and a bread and some macaroni cheese. I got home and punished the whole chicken! I hope it wasn't gluttony, but man I was so hungry. Well I'm on to the Macaroni Cheese now, and then I'm going to do some Greek study for the exam on Monday. So for those of you who remember me in your prayers, please pray for clarity of thought on Monday.   Well the fires a goin, the bean bags a sittin next to it, and the kettle is a singin (well it would be if it had some sort of whistling aparatus attached to it), and the Greek notes are a callin me. I'm sorry folks but I'm a gunna leave you.  Isn't it amusing how this blog has degenerated into fireside chats with Scott over his eating habits. Ok I'll try to remedy that from now on. More other stuff, less food talk.I made butter mince for dinner last night. Yes butter mince due to the fact that I had no chicken to butter. Sad but true. But actually it tastes quite nice.  Today was an amusing day. I woke up at 7:05. Well more like I opened one eye thinking shucks why hasn't my alarm gone off yet and looked at the clock. And then was out of bed in a shot. I yelled at Jono (who was in bed) "make me a sandwhich I'm running late! I quickly got clothed, found some glasses, grabbed my key and ran out to the kitchen. There was Jono wrapped in his duvet buttering me a sandwhich. It was comical. I grabbed the sandwhich (telling Jono he was a legend), jumped in the car and carefully stopping at Stop Signs set off to work. Well I prayed to God, "Please don't make me too late", not that it was a real major or anything. Anyway the traffic was amazing, and I only got there 7 minutes late, which was a relief.  Mind you I had to have two of those fancy French Moritz's today since I only had one sandwhich. Gutted. having to eat ice cream, what a chore.   Hey people... you know how there is a comments button? Yeah the thing in orange writing with underline. Well if you click it, you can write a comment. Hehe and SUBTLE is my middle name!  Oh that's right! The whole point of the post. I got transcribed today at work. Since we are a approved lab, we must minimize our transcription errors. For instance today I got transcribed for not writing a dilution factor for some water I was testing. What's funny is that I don't really care about it. But it can be a source of contention, because it is the other lab staff who in fact do the transcribing. So as you can all imagine, an innocent transcriber can become the subject of backlash transcription, and things can get pretty nasty. I was told about an incident where one of the staff (let's call them lab technician #1) transcribed another (let's call them lab technician #2) for a seemingly innocent mistake. Lab technician #2 then transcribed lab technician #1 into next century for various different mistakes. Since then lab technician #1 has not transcribed lab technician #2. I wonder if  my apathy will have the same effect?Went for a bit of a tour of the factory today. Saw some bits I hadn't seen as yet. It was pretty weord, because I walked into a couple  of the freezers. In one of them, my nose started to feel funny and I could feel moisture in it freezing which was real weord. I asked how cold it was and was told -40. Wowsers. The people who work in there are only in for 15 minutes and then get a half hour break from work in the freezer. It was so cold that when I went outside, the breeze felt like a tropical one.   Well that's all that was really that interesting. Oh that's right. I had a choc bar, and a Moritz (that fancy weord named caramel one). I think it might be "Glace avec un nom français drôle.". Try translating that  urlLink Translator .   Well I better be off with me and do some Greek study.My focus is all crocused.  urlLink Crocus Focus   Thus I will never ever be able to do a post tonight. And I will never ever ever do a post tonight.I was going to post this last night, but I never got the chance. However, I'm off sick today (cold symptoms), so I have managed to get up off the old bean bag to bring you this post! How's that for dedication to the task?  Well I had some very interesting news, and as I promised honesty as I began this blog, I shall share it with you. I received a traffic infringement notice on Sunday whilst picking my Aunty up from the airport. I travelled left through a stop sign intersection like it was a give way.  So I got fined for it. Fair enough too. Well the police officer was very pleasant, and even let me off for the fact that I din't have my license with me, which I thought was pretty decent of him. Funny thing is that this whole incident got me thinking. As I told a few others, they were like yeah well that's what I do! Others made the excuse that as long as no one is coming and you can see it clearly on these stop signs, you should treat them as a give way. But I think not. It's a law of the land, and not matter what we think of it we should obey it, so in essence I believe it was jolly fair I got pinged for breaking it. Isn't it funny how we look upon somethings as really bad (like I do on the red light running issue) and think other things aren't so bad, like giving way only at stop signs, and driving past ten on our restricted, or driving with pasengers on our restricted. It reminds me of the way we so often (myself included obviously) treat God's law. For example:-  Those who break the commandment that tells us not to murder or commit adultery are somehow worse than those who only break the one about stealing, lying or breaking the Sabbath. Funny thing is that although  we  make degrees of sin,  God  makes it clear that ANY sin is enough to disqualify us from his presence. So that's what that road incident reminded me of.  Well yesterday I went round to my next door neighbour's place. Graham Paton (who was my boss at Red Cross) invited me round to have a chat and catch up with what I was doing. It was so cool. We had a really good chat and catch up about things. he is really a top rate guy.   Today I went past Peter Warner's place on the way home to get some panadol for my headache. I saw him out by the road, and stopped in for a chat with him. We talked about youth in the church, the boys camp at Emmanuel which is coming up, and so on. He gave me a stack of panadols for my headache which was really cool.   Well tonight I'm cruising round to my nana's because it's her birthday, so that should be awesome!Alana's 21st was very very cool. She had organised a barn out Karaka way, and we all had to dress up in clothes from the 1920's to 1960's. Everyone got into the dress part..or should I say everyone save Dan. hehe.  Well me and Jono went shopping for our clothes togetehr. The original plan was to get suits and be 1920's gansters, but there was difficulty getting jackets that allowed Jono's muscular shoulders movement, so we gave up on that idea. So in the end we decided to get corduroys. I picked up a pair of trousers for $2. They are brown and are real wide at the bottom. Look really funny. Jono also got a pair (a similar colour). We then got a sort of tight (and I mean ta height) corduroy dinner jackety thing for Jono which was a tad (read a lot) to small. Then I got a corduroy jacket and we finished our purchases off by getting to orange (read LOUD orange) shirts which went underneath the jackets. We decided we must have been visionary 60's people.  Anyway this got me thinking. I realised that I could get clothes for very little. If you're willing to go second hand, and spend a bit of time, you can find clothes that are really nice, and most of us wouldn't even know they were second hand. No I realise the corduroys were obviously old (I will still wear them), but there were heaps of other clothes that weren't like that. I mean one shop we went to had every item of clothing for $2. Well I may now shop for my clothes at Save Mart. Hehe, and nobody mock me about it, because I'm trying to be a good steward!Yay for the weekend! Not only that, but it's Alana's 21st! Awesome stuff. Should be good.  Louise and me have just finished watching "A Knight's Tale". It's one of our favourite movies and we watch it regularly. Hehe, we even know most of the dialogue, and facial expressions. Chaucer is soo soo funny.  This morning I got to work early, and read the passage about Dinah and Shechem. The version I was reading it in translated what took place as 'Schechem violated Dinah." The CEV has the word rape. It was a bit unclear as to what actually took place, because later on Shechem is described as "he was honored above all the house of his father." That tends to indicate that either the rest of his family were a bunch of scoundrels or there is more to this than the initial reading throws up. I thought that perhaps it was an example of fornication where the two parties were consenting. Which is judged to be bad anyway by God. It was seen as a humiliation to not be a virgin when one got married. When I looked at the Hebrew dictionary that came with E Sword, the Hebrew word that has been used as rape or defile had various meanings, meaning it was still possible for my idea about this to be correct. If this were true (and I'm not saying it is, it was just a suggestion) then the fact that we wanted to marry her makes him a bit better. Instead of just getting what he wanted, and then sneaking away and buttering off, he proposed commitment. Not only that, but we see in verse 3 that his heart cleaved to her. This suggests not mere lust, but a constant continued affection. He also offers any price for a dowry, as a way of seeking ammends. Interesting. A difficult passage at any rate, and I'm still not sure what to make of it. But God had everything under control, and he did not want Israel to join into a pagan family, so he destroyed them. Even that's confusing. It seems that the writer looks down on Simeon and Levi for their deceit and murder of Shechem's whanau. They justify their murders by saying that Shechem shouldn't have treated their sister like a prostitute. What really seems to make their action evil, is the use of a sign of the covenant of grace to deceive the men and later kill them. There is much more I wish to look at in this passage, but I share just a few of my thoughts about it here with you.  Better catch some zzzzzzzzzzz's.Well after all that effort, I receive one comment. And it isn't even about the post. It's just a moan about the fact that ice cream was given to one person and not another! You can't win. I decided to visit the old staff shop today. I came out with all sorts of goodies, which I distributed to my youth leaders at C.I.A, and also Tanya, (because she asked). Sorry Alana! I'll get you something next time. Go the boysenberry trumpets!  It's late I'm tired and drained! Gotta go.Ok here we go.   Legalism  Lately in a few of my Christian circles, I have come up against an interesting use of the term legalism. Well as most of you will know, the word is not one which is found directly in the Bible. Anyway, there seems to be confusion over what this word means. This, I believe, is mainly due to misuse of the word, when another word or phrase could be used instead. The word has been hijacked!  To me, and until recently this word meant:-  a reliance on ones works (obeying the law) for salvation. Today some people have hijacked this word, and used it to oppose those people who would confront sin. Those who confront sin are labelled as legalists (which obviously has negative connotations).  The greek word for faith is pistos. Pistos comes from the greek word peitho, which means to obey (among related meanings). Interesting. Faith and obedience seem inextricably linked. Remember also how James argues that faith without works is dead. It is by grace we are saved through faith, which is the gift of God. And with faith that is alive, comes obedience. This is not legalism. It is biblical.  To expect it is also biblical. When 'faith' is not acompanied by obedience, we need to question whether it's saving faith.  1Th 5:14  My friends, we beg you to warn anyone who isn't living right. Encourage anyone who feels left out, help all who are weak, and be patient with everyone.   1Th 5:21  Put everything to the test. Accept what is good  1Th 5:22  and don't have anything to do with evil.    Jud 1:22  Be helpful to all who may have doubts.  Jud 1:23  Rescue any who need to be saved, as you would rescue someone from a fire. Then with fear in your own hearts, have mercy on everyone who needs it. But hate even the clothes of those who have been made dirty by their filthy deeds.    These verses show us that we must warn people who are in sin, that we must have nothing to do with evil, and hate evil. Neverthless, we must show grace in our approach to these tasks. A difficult thing to do, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.   So in summing up:- I'm definately not a works for salvation man, but I do believe works are the fruit of true faith. But nevertheless it is not works that save one. Legalism is not saying something is wrong!    Respect for Church Leaders  1Th 5:12  My friends, we ask you to be thoughtful of your leaders who work hard and tell you how to live for the Lord.  1Th 5:13  Show them great respect and love because of their work. Try to get along with each other.   Interesting, and challenging. I'll remember this next time I'm about to complain and whinge saying I wouldn't do things  that  way.Just had an awesome evening with Ethan, a guy from C.I.A. We had a bit of a CS session. He's a pretty good sniper! Very impressive indeed. We also punished a pizza.   urlLink The never updated youth message board!  I really couln't find the time to get the promised post up, but it's coming. I have become really serious about my bedtimes now that I work shifts. I don't want to be feeling yucky when I'm working.   Oh by the way. Cadbury flakes (in shape of trumpets) are very nice. Go and buy yourself one.Off Tramping  I'm off to the Kauranga valley tomorrow, so I'll not be blogging again until Monday. Should be interesting because this is the first tme I've gone hiking by myself. Sounds geeky, but I really want some time away to :-  1) Think about youth work and ministry. 2) Look at greek study. 3) Spend time in prayer and reading God's Word.Key Quotes   The Church is here to feed the sheep, not entertain the goats	 - Ross Thompson    Depend on it, bad company in the present life, is the sure way to obtain worse company in the life to come.   - J C Ryle    Of Husbands and Wives  I thought since everybody seems to be on fire with this topic. I'd quote a few Scriptures and throw them into the mix. We've had much opinion and what not, but God's Word is what counts, so I'll present it here.   1Pe 3:7  Ye husbands, in like manner, dwell with your wives according to knowledge, giving honor unto the woman, as unto the weaker vessel, as being also joint-heirs of the grace of life; to the end that your prayers be not hindered.  In this verse, husbands are told to give honour to their wives because they are the weaker vessel, and are (equally) heirs of grace. The greek word behind this translation of honour is timeÌ„. This word indicates an honour that is shown because of the status of the object of the honour. We should honour our wives, because the role that God has given them makes them vulnerable to 'exploitation'.    Col 3:19  Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.  In this passage men are commanded to love their wives. The Bible asks men to love their wives in most passages I have looked up on wives and husbands, indicating that it is an important instruction, and it is something men seem to find hard to do. Pay it heed!   Eph 5:25  Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself up for it;  Eph 5:26  that he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water with the word,  Eph 5:27  that he might present the church to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing; but that it should be holy and without blemish.  Eph 5:28  Even so ought husbands also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He that loveth his own wife loveth himself:   Another passage that emphasizes the depth of love that a man must have for his wife. His concern is to b for his wife's physical and spiritual state. He is to love her like he cares for his own body. It is a sacrificial love, a love of servant leadership. If a man does not love his wife in this way, he is a slack reflection of Christ.   Tit 2:4  that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children,  Tit 2:5  to be sober-minded, chaste, workers at home, kind, being in subjection to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed:   And to the women. They too must love their husbands, and their children (it is assumed that it is natural for a marriage to produce children). They must be 'in subjection' to their husbands, so that God's Word may not be blasphemed. The Greek word that is translated to subjection here is from hupotasso, which means to be subordinate, to obey, be subject to, and to submit oneself to. If a wife does not do this, it is not her husband she sins against, but God she blasphemes against.   1Pe 3:1  In like manner, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands; that, even if any obey not the word, they may without the word be gained by the behavior of their wives;  Again the Greek word hupotasso, is used here. In this case, the woman who is married has an unbelieving husband. he may be a slack or harsh leader, but by her very actions of submitting to him, she can win him to Christ. What a glorious thought!    Eph 5:22  Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord.  Eph 5:23  For the husband is the head of the wife, and Christ also is the head of the church, being himself the saviour of the body.  Eph 5:24  But as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives also be to their husbands in everything. Once again hupotasso is used.  Marriage again is seen to reflect Christ's relationship to the church. Jut as the church submits to Christ in all things, so the wife must submit to the husband in all things. This submission should occur in the same way as submission to the Lord occurs.   Eph 5:33  Nevertheless do ye also severally love each one his own wife even as himself; and let the wife see that she fear her husband.   Here the husband again is told to love his wife AS himself. Tough stuff guys. Specially if you love yourselves lots hehe. And the wife must fear her husband. This comes from the Greek word phobeo. It can mean to fear, to be in awe of, or to revere.   And lastly a word to the guys:-   1Ti 3:12  Let deacons be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.  If we want to be a leaders in God's church, we must be leaders ub our family.   A lot of tough stuff in there for both sexes, but it is the Word of God. Isn't it funny that God's word picks out the things that each sex has the most difficulty with and hones in on it. Men can be very callous and unloving, and they are commanded to have a  the  most sacrificial love. Women find it easier to love, but difficult to come under the submission of their husbands.   The muddied waters of secular education   (from Maxim Institute's Real issues newsletter  The Ministry of Education has funded the building of a mosque at Hagley Community College in Christchurch. With 120 Muslim migrant students, Hagley will provide the country's first purpose-built mosque in a public school.   Is it reasonable to use taxpayer's money to invest in a place of worship for a particular religion? To do so would appear to contravene the 'secular' basis of state schooling going back to the 1877 Education Act. There are of course, options for parents seeking religious schooling. The Integration Act of 1975 provides for special (religious) character schools to receive state funding for operations and teacher salaries; and there are private or independent schools, most of which are linked to Christian churches and specific denominations.   In the interests of preserving a clear separation of all churches and religious expressions from the state, the secular clause makes sense, especially when there are the options of integration, independent schools, and an amount of local discretion eg. ('Bible in School' programmes). Funding the Hagley mosque goes beyond these options though, and muddies the waters of an important constitutional separation.How Far We Have Come  I was reading the other day that Germaine Greer was arrested in the 1970's for saying bulls*** and f*** in the Auckland Town Hall. She was taken to court and fined. Isn't it amazing how far we have come since then? That makes it sound almost positive. Perhaps I should say "Isn't it amazing how far we have sunk into the mire since then?"Person Of the Week  Amy is my person of the week! Awesome to have a bit of dialogue and discussion on the ol' blog. Has sparked quite a bit of interest, which is all G double O D. So keep it up it’s good stuff. Nice to have your comments! :)   Book of the Month  I’ve just completed “Thoughts for Young Men” by J.C Ryle, which has been somewhat of a kick-up-the-backside for me, which is good. I’ve learnt heaps out of it, and will include some thought-provoking quotes from it soon.   CD of the Week  I’ve been listening to Elgar’s  Cello concerto this week. A very beautiful, perhaps melancholy piece. Jacqueline du Pré does a most brilliant interpretation of this piece, which leaves me shivering at times. If you want to borrow the CD let me know!    Of Tax  As a little introduction to this whinge. Let me begin by saying a few things:- I do not come from a wealthy family. I come from a hard working family, who live in the suburb of Manurewa, and we could probably be classed as Lower-middle-class. My Dad is a Christian School teacher (so don’t think State School pay rates!) and up until recently my mum did not work. So this is not a rich kid moaning about how unfair it is to pay tax. Our family has worked and saved for what we have. Ok?  Ok I’m not a happy chappy about this situation. here’s the problem.  19% income tax. 12.5% tax on every item one purchases.  High rate of tax on petrol one buys. High rate of tax on tobacco one buys. High rate of tax on alcohol one buys. Secondary tax (if you have more than one job) of 33% (yes one dollar out of every 3 you earn).  But my real problem is this. If I pay so much tax, why can I not expect a police officer around at my house when I get burgled, in 30 minutes rather than the whopping 19 hours average that it takes in Counties Manukau. Why cannot police investigate when I get burgled, or when someone rams into my car and takes off? If, (as I believe it is) the job of the government is primarily to protect it’s citizens and their property, then why the heck can they not manage it with taxes as weighty as these.  Why is 1/3 of government expenditure on the ridiculously named “Social Welfare”.  Why should the government get 12.5% of the money I spend on food, and necessities... come to think of it anything at all. Why should I pay more tax (33%) for being a hard-worker who has two jobs?  Is this creating incentive to work hard? Why should I be taxed at a higher rate if I earn more than a certain income? Since if I earn 100,000 I will still be paying a heck of a lot more tax even if I pay the same percentage of tax as someone earning 20,000. This is so wrong. It is a disincentive to do well for oneself. Not only that, but the government will tax you on the interest you earn in your bank savings! A disincentive to save! And you can’t even die dammit without your inheritence money being taxed by the government. Yes! You're taxed for dying already! “Oh I’m sorry sir, we’ll have to take some money off you, please don’t die in future.” Well at least it used to be this way, I’m not sure if it there still is a ‘death dues’ tax. Maybe one of you brainy people could find that out.  I am by no means arguing for no tax. But give us a break! We should pay income tax. But all this other stuff is becoming ridiculous. It is the result of moving away from God. When the church does not flourish, the state must provide for the needy (the deserving and the undeserving), and taxes will have to rise as a result.   Story of the Week  Via Anita comes this very topical tale. (Please note the alliteration.)   A tale for our times??. Classic Version: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool, and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The shivering grasshopper has no food or shelter, so he dies out in the cold.  The Modern New Zealand Version: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. The grasshopper thinks he's a fool, and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. The shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others less fortunate like him are cold and starving.  The TV crews show up to provide live coverage of the shivering grasshopper, with cuts to a video of the ant in his comfortable warm home with a table filled with food. New Zealanders are stunned that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so while others have plenty. The Greens, the trade unions and the Coalition Against Poverty demonstrate in front of the ant's house. TV1 News, interrupting a cultural festival special from Ngaruawahia with breaking news, broadcasts them singing "We Shall Overcome." Dun Mihaka rants in an interview with Pam Corkery that the ant has gotten rich off the backs of grasshoppers, and calls for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his "fair share." In response to polls, the Labour Government drafts the Economic Equity and Grasshopper Anti-Discrimination Act, retroactive to the beginning of the summer. With the help of United Future and Jim Anderton's mob, the bill is quickly passed into law. The ant's taxes are reassessed and he is also fined for failing to hire grasshoppers as helpers. Without enough money to pay both the fine and his newly imposed retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government. The ant moves to Asia, and starts a successful agribiz company. The TV stations later show the now fat grasshopper finishing up the last of the ant's food though Spring is still months away, while the government owned house he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he hadn't maintained it. Inadequate government funding is blamed, Margaret Wilson now is appointed to head a commission of enquiry that will cost $10,000,000. The grasshopper is soon dead of a drug overdose, the NZ Herald blames it on obvious failure of government to address the root causes of despair arising from social inequity. The abandoned house is taken over by a gang of immigrant spiders, praised by the government for enriching New Zealand's multicultural diversity, who promptly terrorize the community. Who says we don't live in a democracy?   Of Our Recent Discussion  Amy as I have previously mentioned has got this blog going! Great to have some discussion. Anyway I was getting sick of posting silly little comments on it, and it’s turned out to be quite an issue. I have thought about what has been argued, and have some stuff I would like to throw in the mix.  As I mentioned in one of my comments, Jonah was commanded to go to the Assyrians, to tell them of their impending doom. God here was sending Jonah to warn these people that there sin was an offense to Him. The result was repentance, and the turning of God’s wrath.  Peter at Pentecost convicted the people of their sin, by saying that they were responsbile for Christ’s death. Obviously because of their sin (not many of them would have personally banged the nails in Jesus’ hands since they came from all over the known world.). His speech convicted them to repent.  Paul did a similar thing in Athens. He spoke to them about the statue that had to an unknown God. he talked to them about the true God and said “In the past, God forgave all this because people did not know what they were doing. But now he says that everyone everywhere must turn to him. He has set a day when he will judge the world's people with fairness. And he has chosen the man Jesus to do the judging for him. God has given proof of this to all of us by raising Jesus from death. As soon as the people heard Paul say that a man had been raised from death, some of them started laughing. Others said, "We will hear you talk about this some other time." Here Paul talks of God’s coming judgement, and warns the unbelievers about it.   Our actions should match our words, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t say things. To warn people of their sin, may convict them (like it did in the three above cases) and save them by God’s grace from their sin. This surely is reason enough to speak out against wickedness in society. The time of grace is now. Let us warn people now before the time of eternal judgement comes!And the Winner Is....  Amanda McGrail, St Heliers.  Although I hardly expect she saw the challenge I gave on my blog yesterday about writing a letter! Here is her excellent letter.   "Why would Jane Norton criticise Samuel Carpenter for wanting to honour his wife? Erotic advertisements for women's lingerie do little to encourage women and everything to play with men's minds.  I am thankful that there are some young men around who want to tell their wives that despite the smorgasboard of sluttishness they face every day, they want their eyes to be only for her; that they took their wedding vows seriously.  I am sure Samuel Carpenter's wife felt honoured and adored by his letter, certainly not exploited. The increasing sexualisation of our culture is doing no one any favours, except advertisers whose creative flair seems stuck below the waist."   And to that I say "Amen and Amen."  Just as an aside does anyone know why one of the first results of the fall in Genesis was man trying to clothe himself, and then God clothing him? (Serious question, I have my own theories, but I'd like to know what ya'll think.)Letter to the Editor and a challenge  Today Jane Norton has a letter in the Herald as a reply to my one. I will post her reply; not because it is worthy of being posted, but so that you can see the total lack of clear thinking coming from many feminists.    "I thank Scott Kennedy for pointing out to me that Samuel Carpenter's statement about women being the viewing property of their spouse only is simply because of Mr Carpenter's concern at the exploitation of women. It would appear that private exploitation, in the form of a husband owning his wife, is acceptable but public exploitation is not."   Ok, I'm not even going to talk about the clumsy first sentence, but rather about her big flaw. In this letter she is admitting that the posting of billboards is public exploitation, but instead of saying "No that's wrong" she uses a most flawed argument.  She seems to insist that since there is some private exploitation (and we'll come to that) it's OK to have public exploitation.  It's actually not at all clear that she knows what she is arguing for. Have I convinced her that public exploitation is wrong, and now she is moving onto defeat private? Either way she is jeopardizing her first argument, that the billboards are fine, and it is repressive to get rid of them.  Now I'd like to look at what she called 'private exploitation'. She labels the monogamous relationship of marriage as exploitation, where a husband 'owns' a wife, and she is his 'viewing property'. Well I say a hearty "Amen" to this. As it says in  I Corinthians 7:4  "A wife belongs to her husband instead of to herself, and a husband belongs to his wife instead of to himself." This kind of relationship is a wonderful protection for women. Instead of being a restriction to women, it protects them from undesirable occurrences. God is not a feminist (I think that's the name of a book), and He ordained marriage as a mutually beneficial relationship of committment, which directly reflects Christ and His relationship to the Church. Feminism does not empower women. Instead it makes them more vulnerable to exploitation than ever. Here we have a feminist who attacks marriage, and sees no problem with women being plastered around on big billboards for all and sundry to oogle over. Posting women naked or semi-naked on big billboards encourages a superficial and shallow view of women to be adopted by a society. This more than marriage reduces women to a commodity, an object which can be compared to others, and rejected on basis of aesthetic qualities, rather than the qualities of a gentle and quiet spirit, or a love for the Lord. So in reality feminists are degrading women, and we Christians must arise to protect them.  So having said this (and I could say much more, and maybe will do so in a future post), I leave a challenge. Let's not all sit on the fence, and say "That's nice" or "That's interesting". Arise, get your pen, and paper (or your email) and write letters to the editor, exposing this attack on marriage for what it is! Stupidity. Marriage is the foundation of a society, and if it is attacked we Christians must defend it. Let us protect our sisters, and expose this nonsense for what it is.  PS I will post more on this when I get some time.Letter to the Editor  Today is a good day! I got a letter to the New Zealand Herald in in reply to a feminist bashing a guy of integrity. She said he should be made to live in Saudi Arabia, because he objected to billboards of semi-naked/nude women being displayed in public places. She called him a repressive type. Again, another instance of what I have been talking about. If you don't agree with the anti-Christian agenda (and I believe there is one) then sod off and go to another country, or shut up. You are not allowed to have an opposing view. And as I have already said. Enough already! Speak out (or letter write).   Of Trogdor  His majesty increases. There is less of his piteous hiding behind the heater or filter tricks these days. Today I fed the fish. Now he being the only bottom feeding creature was given a little pill like piece of food for his consumption. When the top feeding fish had demolished their meal, they started to eat Trogdor's. And Trogdor smote the fishs, and all was laid to burnination. Seriously though, he was not amused at this invasion of his own nutrient supply, so gave chase. In the end he got really ticked off and just randomly chased fish around the tank for the fun of it.    Breakfast  Ethan (a guy from C.I.A) and I went to Macdonalds for breakfast this morning. 'Twas a very interesting experience. We both ordered a 'massive' McMuffin breakfast. Well, obviously massive means something different from what it did when I went to school. It was quite peturbing. Here I was (after looking at the picture) expecting some monolithic muffin with such imposing bulk that I might not be able to quite finish it. Instead what did I get? An impoverished indigent item which one almost had to feel sorry for. The egg if it could be called an egg, (and believe me I was highly suspicious about it's origins when I depressed it and it bounced back like some kind of rubber) looked highly processed, and was in a most unnatural looking shape. Thank goodness it was the fellowship we came for.   Happy Birthdays  Hamish! Happy birthday.... sorry I forgot! God bless ya heaps, and I'm sure there will be many more.   My mum also is having a birthday today, so I'm taking her out for coffee. But I won't say happy birthday here, 'cos she'll never see it. Hehe.   Democracy   A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government.  It can only exist until the voters discover that they can vote themselves  (money) from the treasury.  From that moment on the majority votes for the candidates promising the most benefits from the public treasury, with a result that a democracy always collapses over loose fiscal policy followed by a dictatorship.  The average age of the worlds greatest civilizations have progressed 200 years.  These nations have progressed through the following sequence:  From bondage to spiritual faith From spiritual faith to great courage From courage to liberty From liberty to abundance From abundance to selfishness From selfishness to complacency From complacency to apathy From apathy to dependency And from dependency back to bondage.   Alexander Fraser Tyler (1748-1843) The Decline and fall of the Athenian Republic.  I would be interested to see where ya'll think we are on that road the qoute talks about. God bless you all.Fishs  I got some fish today. I've named a few of them.  urlLink Trogdor  is this really cool black one with a red tail, and he has fangs (and majesty). He kinda hangs out at the back of the tank underneath the filter, or between the filter and the heater. Then there is "Arrowed" (a male guppy) and "Sworded" (the pregnant female guppy).    Real Issues - Maxim Weekly Email   This came out in real issues. Ms Turia is the type of 'radical Maori' I was talking about in a post a few days earlier. I refuse to be called a guest. I am tangata whenua. I belong here, and this is my country, as much as it is any other New Zealand citizens.    Are Pakeha guests in New Zealand?   Are Pakeha merely guests in New Zealand? Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia has made it clear she believes that to be the case. She wants the name 'Maori' to be replaced by 'tangata whenua' - the people of the land - to emphasise they are the hosts.   Ms Turia is a member of a government trying to promote Maori and Pakeha as partners. But we can't have it both ways. What she is implying in talking of 'hosts' and 'guests', is, that the host is in charge and guests have to comply with their way of doing things. This is not a partnership. The question remains: are Pakeha guests, settlers, or conquerors? Historian Michael King, who has strong links with Maori, offers another perspective in his book Being Pakeha Now:   "Like the ancestors of the Maori, [my ancestors] came as immigrants; like Maori too, we became indigenous at the point where our focus of identity and commitment shifted to this country and away from our countries and cultures of origin. Again like Maori, our culture - mainstream Pakeha culture - altered here in response to a relationship with the land and its flora and fauna. Ultimately that culture was transformed by interaction, history and experience into something whose proportions and combinations bore only a distant relationship to the original ingredients. People who live in New Zealand by choice as distinct from an accident of birth, and who are committed to this land and its people and steeped in their knowledge of both, are no less 'indigenous' than Maori."   Also, like other ministers, Ms Turia is attempting to change the language shaping our understanding of present and past issues. In a Civil Society, however, both our language and grasp of history needs to be clear, objective and accurate.Work  It's 10:53pm, and I just got home from work. Feels weird. But I'm happy because I got my Pray For Rain (PFR) cd's today.  urlLink Jono  also received his. Funny thing is, he ordered his a week before mine, and paid extra for 'fast' shipping, whilst I used 'economy'. Oh well, I guess economy is the way to go!    Fishs  Tomorrow I am going fishing for  urlLink fishs . I'll probably grab me some plants as well. I might even post a photo somewhere so ewes can check it out in all it's  urlLink majesty .Request for Recipe  Yes it's coming! The recipe for Scott's Butter Mince Curry will be posted after my final test and adjustments. Be patient... I know you want to try it! Anita has told me specifically that she can't wait. Haha joking.. I think it wasn't as positive as that.   Of Fish  The tank is set up. It's 55L, and I got some gravel, a filter, a heater, thermometer, chemicals and am just getting the pH and temperature issues sorted before I introduce fish. I hope to add some plants and fish tomorrow. Should be good. And then you can all come round and have a look..... maybe we could crack open the jelly tips... or maybe even the butter mince.   Procrastination Issue  I have been working on a way of solving my procrastination issues. I will probably finish my plan today. Then all that remains is adhering to it. I will demonstrate it when I finish it completely, as long as it does not take me away from important tasks. That's what procrastination is really about. Not doing something you could be, but rather doing something that is unimportant.Tropical Fish  I feel the urge to set up a tropical fish tank in my room. I think it would make for a great hobby. I will investigate the pet shop on the morrow. I don't start work until 2:00pm tomorrow, so I have a free morning, which will be good to utilise.   Prayer Box  I remember once, somebody talking about a box they had with a slot at the top. They would write down prayer concerns or worries they had, and insert them in the box, and pray about them, committing them to God. I have constructed my own little prayer box out of a 'punished' memphis meltdowns box (not the three pack... we're talking about the big packs here...). Well the person who mentioned this said that after a few months of inserting prayer needs into the box, they would crack it open, and read what they had prayed about. Apparently it was such a blessing to see how God had answered so many prayer concerns.    Jono's Blog   urlLink Jono  goes hard on the topic of men. Go Jono! Sock it to 'em. Truth is truth, and while it should be said with Grace... it should be said; period.    1000  On the 12th of August, you guys are going to make this blog tick over the 1000 visits mark. Wish that were comments already!Scott's Butter Mince Curry  I made this for my family on Friday night. They live yet.......so I have called my recipe experiment a success. It is now fully customized by me, and I will release it after just one more trial with some different people. Tastes very nice. You may mock now, but I assure you this time I'm really on to something. It's not just another one of my soups. Although some of them wern't half bad you know.    Young Men's Bible Study  We started our young men's Bible study today, amidst memphis meltdowns, pies, fish cakes (and maybe some kind of  urlLink fish sauce  from the market too), and of course the beautiful apple cake from Mark. The food was awesome, and was punished by all concerned. We also studied the Bible!Lack of Posting  This week my computer has been playing up somewhat. Me and Allan dealt to it last Saturday, but it kept on being a mongrel. Perhaps by saying I have reformatted 5 times will make you understand why I have not had the time to blog. I was almost tempted to get the old GT500 back up on the internet by nicking the modem from Veyron. Ah well, Veyron is now fully functional..... I think.   Jono's Blog  Jono's blog is like a cat. It has nine lives. He can start it up NINE times.   Person of the Week  This week, I have a couple as people of the week. Simon and Anne Camp are my people of the week. They have been running a series at C.I.A youth on "Preparing for Intimate Relationships." It's great to see people serving young people by sharing their wisdom with them. They have put so much work into what they are doing, and it really shows.    The Bible  This quote comes from the front of the little Bibles they hand out at university, and is very good.   The Bible contains the mind of God, the state of man, the way of salvation, the doom of sinners, and the happiness of believers. Its doctrines are holy, its precepts are true, and its decisions are immutable. Read it to be wise, believe it to be safe, and practice it to be holy. It contains light to direct you, food to support you, and comfort to cheer you.  It is the traveller's map, the pilgrim’s staff, the pilot’s compass, the soldier’s sword, and the Christian’s charter. Here Paradise is restored, Heaven opened, and the gates of hell disclosed.  Christ is its grand subject, our good the design, and the glory of God its end.  It should fill the memory, rule the heart, and guide the feet. Read it slowly, frequently, and prayerfully. It is a mine of wealth, a paradise of glory, and a river of pleasure. It is given you in life, will be opened at the judgement, and will be remembered forever. It involves the highest responsibility, will reward the greatest labour, and will condemn all who trifle with its sacred contents .   Encouragement  My goal this week, is to be more encouraging to those whom I meet. Encouragement is so important. I encourage you all to encourage your pastors and elders.Read Dan's blog. He wrote a really really cool post!  urlLink Go Dan!Butter Mince  I made butter mince again tonight. I have slightly refined my recipe, but it still needs refining. Will let you know when this process is complete. It's getting very nice. So to all those who mock.... watch out, because butter mince is coming to a restaurant near you.   Person of the Week  Jono is person of the week this week! Very thoughtfully invited me around this week, when I was feeling down, and we just hung. Was real good. Thanks Jono, you made my day.   Wuthering Heights  Have just begun reading Wuthering Heights for the 5th (I think). I really enjoy... hehe. Really?!   Bill English  I was really impressed with Bill English and his stand against Euthanasia. It's a pity that we have fallen so far in this nation that  a decent moral bloke cannot get support, while a godless (and anti-God) woman can take the country down a road to the devil. While I'm not saying Bill is a Christian (although he may well claim to be and is a Catholic). I am trying to differentiate between leadership which leads directly away from moral foundations, and leadership while not Christian, still has a moral conscience. Examples of both can be found in the Old Testament. I'm probably not making much sense as I am really tired, I'll try to explain next time.Butterflies  Butterflies are insects. They have four wings covered with tiny, shingle-like scales and by mouthparts that form a hollow, flexible tube like a drinking straw. Most butterflies eat nectar of flowers. Butterflies have small bodies and large wings, and a pair of antennae on their heads. Butterfly (singular) is also a type of swimming stroke. Muhammad Ali could "float like a butterfly, sting like a bee." I like butterflies. They are cool.Politics, Racism And Suchlike  After tomorrow is over, my blog will take a break from politics race and suchlike. I know some of those less interested in these things must be getting bored, so on Wednesday I will talk about butterflys or something equally contraversial. So look forward to the break from contraversy!   Allan's Blog and Racism - edited with help from Nato  1. Racial Discrimination (a form of racism) is dealing with people according to their race, and not according to their actual circumstances. (For example one could say “All Asians are bad drivers so Mr Chang being an Asian cannot have a drivers license. However Mr Chang may in fact be an excellent driver, and should have a drivers license.)  2. To allow people of Maori or Pacific origin into a computer course for free, but to charge those from other backgrounds is racial discrimination, since it deals with Maori Pacific Islanders as if they are all poor and in need of help, and Pakeha as if they are all rich and able to help support others and help themselves.  3. Racial Discrimination is wrong  Conclusion:- It is wrong for Maori and Pacific Islanders to get into a computer course for free when other races cannot.   To disagree with the conclusion this you must disagree with one of the premises, since if you agree with the premises, the conclusion follows logically. Perhaps you might like to argue that even if the premises are correct, some racial discrimination is not bad. In that case you will need to spell out in which cases, and why. Otherwise, I would tend to think that this case we discussed in Allan’s blog is bad, and is something that shouldn’t be happening!   A better way of arguing this would is summarized by Nato “race isn't an accurate measure of need. Need is the best measure of need”   Extract From My Essay On NZ Society  As a nation we have scoffed at the idea of absolute truth, and embraced relativism. We thus make ourselves hypocrites, because we want a society where people respect each other, yet we have rejected a basis for absolute standards of morality that can produce such a society. Not surprisingly, the government, representing us, has pulled the plug on civil society; it has rejected virtue, just as it’s citizens have. Society has elected to run with ’values’ which are subjective and personal, and now reaps the consequences of the ‘freedom’ sown. By rejecting the boundaries of absolute morality and personal responsibility, we have opted instead for the shackles of increased state control and responsibility over our lives. Edmunde Burke, hit the nail on the head when he said;    “Men are qualified for civil liberty in exact proportion to their disposition  to put moral chains upon their own appetites.........Society cannot exist unless a controlling  power upon will and appetite be placed somewhere, and the less of it there is within, the more there must be without.”   Government social policy has tried to legitimatize and subtly supported alternate forms of ’family’ other than the traditional marriage based family. It has done this through laws such as no-fault divorce, through the legitimisation of homosexual relationships, through the welfare system, and through education. Government welfare programmes created disincentives for families aiding their members, and in the long run have encouraged family break down. These programmes have made it economically viable for women to have babies outside of marriage, and for fathers to shirk responsibility in favour of government income assistance. The very fact that we support these lifestyles gives those who live them reason for doing so.  In the research for this paper, I read the 1998 Business Plan for the Department of Social Welfare. (Does anybody else find it strange that a department which ideally should be reducing it’s cliental is creating a business plan as if it were a growth industry?) Inside the front cover, it proudly stated that Social Welfare handled one in every three dollars of government expenditure. This is shocking. One third of tax payer money is being used to support lifestyles many of which are proven to be disastrous for children and society, producing tragedies such as the death of Michael Choy and his youthful murderers. Furthermore, these lifestyles are uneconomical. We are too busy focussing on poverty, by giving handouts instead of looking at one of the primary causes of poverty, which is found in social policy hostile to marriage. Thus we are continually exacerbating the problem. The welfare state itself discourages families from staying together, as it offers finance for other lifestyles. However, the very lifestyles that this promotes leads to further poverty, both physically, and morally.      Personal Responsibility  Does society owe us? Do we have a right to money from other people if we are poor? These questions are not the same as "Should society help those in need?" A problem I think we have is that we confuse these questions. No person has a right to another persons money. It is not some God-given right. Here is a further extract:-     "It will also be vital to create a strong independent voluntary sector that can offer an alternative to government welfare..... As we reduce government welfare, less tax will be required, and people will have more disposable income to give to charity. Volunteer organizations are a major component in building social capital. They enable people to publicly practise the virtues that should be learned in the family. Family and friends are important in temporarily supporting others in need, but when this is not possible, voluntary associations provide the best alternative, not the government. When assistance comes from real people, and not some monolithic state organisation, face to face relationships will result, and people will respect the aid that comes to them, not as a right, but as a gift. This will decrease the likelihood of dishonesty and abuse of welfare. Voluntary institutions will flourish in a society that loves virtue, as the government steps back and allows them to fulfill their proper task. These institutions create a context for rights to be matched by responsibility, and hold back the power of the state."Rock Of Ages  Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee; Let the water and the blood, From Thy riven side which flowed, Be of sin the double cure, Cleanse me from its guilt and power.  Not the labours of my hands Can fulfil Thy law's demands; Could my zeal no respite know, Could my tears for ever flow, All for sin could not atone: Thou must save, and Thou alone.  Nothing in my hand I bring, Simply to Thy Cross I cling; Naked, come to Thee for dress; Helpless, look to Thee for grace; Foul, I to the fountain fly; Wash me, Saviour, or I die.  While I draw this fleeting breath, When mine eyelids close in death, When I saw through tracts unknown,  See Thee on Thy judgement throne, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, Let me hide myself in Thee.

Like the ones who burgle, rape, murder etc. Why is it that heaps and heaps of burglaries go unsolved, and yet we waste time on  urlLink this?    The Great Turia Tells Us There Are Many Racists In New Zealand.  Check  urlLink this.   Let me alert you to this woman's own racist ramblings..... (all articles from the Herald online)  1)  Government minister Tariana Turia says Maori should be on gambling regulatory bodies as of right to ensure they get their fair share of poker machine profits to replace money generated through traditional fundraisers such as housie, raffles and two-up.    2)  Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia has labelled the word as "Pakeha" and says the people native to New Zealand want it changed to tangata whenua (people of the land).   - I assume white folk are not people of the land even though they have lived here all their lives? Piffle as Dan would say.  3)  Figures showing Maori are twice as likely to die of cancer than non-Maori show there is active discrimination in the health system, Associate health minister Tariana Turia said today.   Presumably since we have a public health system that makes Maori pay triple what everyone else has to pay, and does not pay their doctors extra for having patients of Maori or Pacific lineage.....  4)  Opposition parties yesterday failed in their attempts yesterday to paint Associate Maori Affairs Minister Tariana Turia as a Government rebel breaching collective responsibility by supporting the Waitangi Tribunal oil and gas reserves claim.   Thought I'd throw that in. Haha yeah well THAT's definately in the treaty.   5)  Tariana Turia, the minister responsible for Maori family welfare, says campaigns to help Maori solve social problems such as family violence undermine rangatiratanga.   "Tangata whenua get frustrated when official agencies tell us how to solve 'our' problems," Mrs Turia writes in a regular online column, Beehive Chat.   "We are the targets of campaigns to prevent family violence and neglect, to improve our health and education.   'These campaigns can further undermine our rangatiratanga [variously translated as sovereignty or self-reliance]"    Presumably in the same way that lower entry grades into university, and free computer courses etc do as well?   But alas, enough already before I die of uncontrollable laughter.  And now for a highly respected and intelligent man.  Sir Apirana Ngata had criticised the Labour Government's move towards a social welfare programme in the 1930s, saying it would bury Maori initiative and create a culture of dependence.     Amen and Amen. And he spoke a true prophecy. If we cannot agree on the fairness of these 'benefits based on race' we must agree on their lack of success. The more that is given, the worse the dependency becomes.Jono   urlLink Jono  is now old. Turning 21 today!Excerpt From Real Issues  The smacking debate   The tragic death of 6-year-old Coral Burrows has prompted calls from the Prime Minister, Social Services Minister, Steve Maharey, and the Commissioner for Children to remove Section 59 of the Crimes Act. This section allows parents to use 'reasonable force' when disciplining their children.   But let's be clear: Section 59 does not advocate smacking; it allows for reasonable parental force, which may include smacking. Obviously, responsible parents use a range of measures, and in no way is it a licence to beat children. Moreover, there is a consistent failure among child advocates to see that family dysfunction is a cause of abuse and that smacking and violence are poles apart. There is no evidence that smacking leads to violence, and the law is quite clear about the difference between the two.   When used properly, smacking is a quick correction to bring a child's behaviour back into line; it seeks to restore the parent-child relationship affected by the child's unacceptable behaviour. If done in a context of stable and committed family relationships, it is motivated by love and a commitment to the child's best interests. As children develop, most parents naturally use it less and less.   Abuse, however, is belting, punching, or beating. It is motivated by anger, frustration, revenge or some other volatile desire to 'get back at' the child. Abuse aims to inflict pain, revenge or humiliation. It is often associated with parental neglect, dictatorial control, indulgence and incompetence, and unstable and uncommitted relationships. Making smacking illegal will criminalise responsible parents, but will do nothing to stop abusers.The Treaty Continued  Let us all imagine for a moment that I travelled to Italy. And I had an accident. (I had enough of doing it in New Zealand). Now let us imagine that the fault lay with both people, and the nice police man came and wrote up a report in Italian, and translated it into English, which I sign (assuming the same is said in Italian.) The version of the incident that I sign says since the fault lies with both of us, I will only need to pay $100 and the man who banged into me will pay me $100  and will take his car to the panel-beaters. The Italian version says I must pay $100 and the Italian man must pay me $100 and I must bring the other mans car to the panel-beaters. Since I signed the English version I have different expectations to the Italian man who signed the Italian one. The document cannot be made a legal document, since neither party was aware at the time of signing the true obligations he was expected to fulfill.  In a similar way we have a problem with the treaty.  Now I come to a more important point. How long does this 'legal' treaty last for? Is it a treaty that lasts forever? And if so what kind of special powers does it have? Does it use them for good or for awesome? no but seriously guys, what other treaty lasts forever?  Let's investigate:- 1) Versailles, Treaty of, peace treaty signed at the end of World War I between Germany and the Allies. It was negotiated during the Paris Peace Conference held in Versailles beginning January 18, 1919. .....By the Treaty of Versailles, Germany was required to abolish compulsory military service; to reduce its army to 100,000; to demilitarize all the territory on the left bank of the Rhine River and also that on the right bank to a depth of 50 km (31 mi); to stop all importation, exportation, and nearly all production of war material; to limit its navy to 24 ships, with no submarines, the naval personnel not to exceed 15,000; and to abandon all military and naval aviation by October 1, 1919. Germany also agreed to permit the trial of former emperor William II by an international court on the charge of "a supreme offense against international morality."  2) Locarno, Treaties of, series of seven agreements designed to promote the security of western Europe at the end of World War I (1914-1918). The treaties were signed by representatives from Belgium, Czechoslovakia, France, Germany, Britain, Italy, and Poland in Locarno, Switzerland, on October 16, 1925, and signed in London, England, on December 1, 1925. The first of the Locarno treaties guaranteed the common boundaries of France, Germany, and Belgium. The Rhineland, an area covering parts of Belgium, France, and Germany, was established as a neutral zone. The British and Italians were involved in the guarantee, but they did not have any new military obligations to ensure the implementation of the treaties. Although France signed security treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia, the treaties did not offer the same frontier recognition to the countries on Germany's eastern borders. There were, however, agreements providing for the arbitration of disputes between Germany and its Belgian, French, Czechoslovak, and Polish neighbors. The treaties were to operate within the framework of the League of Nations, which Germany joined in 1926.  3) Charles the Bold (1433-1477), last duke of Burgundy, the son of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy, and Isabella of Portugal, born in Dijon. In 1452 he became count of Charolais. When King Louis XI of France forced Philip to cede some towns on the Somme River, Charles formed the League of the Public Weal, an alliance of noblemen. League forces threatened Paris and defeated the king at MontlhÃ©ry, near Paris, in 1465. The result was the Treaty of Conflans, by which the towns on the Somme were restored and the counties of Boulogne, Guines, and Ponthieu were granted to Charles.  4) The Treaty of Frankfurt, signed on May 10, 1871, ended the war between France and Germany. The treaty provided that the French province of Alsace (excepting Belfort) and part of Lorraine, including Metz, were to be ceded to the German Empire, and that France was to pay a war indemnity of 5 billion gold francs ($1 billion), submitting to occupation by German troops until the amount was rendered in full. This heavy obligation was discharged in September 1873, and during the same month, after an occupation of almost three years, France was at last freed of German soldiers.  Just a few examples here. Note how in each case the treaty is formed in a certain situation. Now that this situation is no longer applicable, the treaties are irrelevant. (Check for example the standing army of less than 100,000 for Germany).  A treaty may be terminated by reliance on the principle rebus sic stantibus ("things remaining that way"), that is, when the state of affairs assumed by the signatory parties (when they signed the treaty, and therefore the real basis of the treaty), no longer exists, and a substantial change in conditions has taken place. Is this not the case?!

Giving Back Land  There seems to be some confustication over my views. I do support land that was stolen being given back. As I said  "Where land has been taken unlawfully, it must be given back."   And the main point I believe is as follows:-  "Let me also remind you that this document is beginning to be viewed as a legal document. But how can it be? If the English version significantly differs to the Maori version, then the Treaty surely is invalid, since neither side can be reasonably expected to know what the other sides version of the document says. And therefore are signing different agreements! If it is invalid, then it must be done away with entirely. "How To Get People to Read Your Blog  Please go straight to next heading for ideas.   Irrelevant and Outdated Piece Of Paper?  The Treaty of Waitangi is a document for a specific time and place. The time is long passed and the place (19th century New Zealand) is now gone. Let me illustrate that with quotes from the treaty of Waitangi.   From the first article:- "the Chiefs of the Confederation and all the chiefs who have not joined that Confederation give absolutely to the Queen of England for ever the complete government over  their land". This comes from the Maori version. Question:- Where is the Queen of England now. Sovereignty has again been ceded in all practicality to New Zealand. This document is now outdated, since the sovereignty that was ceded has now been placed back into the hands of those living in this land.  From the second article:- "The Queen of England agrees to protect the chiefs, the subtribes.....and all the people of New Zealand in the unqualified excercise of their chieftenship over their lands, villages and all their treasures." Where the heck is the Queens protection now? Once again handed back to us. This is the Maori version, but the English version seems to indicate even more obviously that what is being said here is that Maori (and others) will be protected in their ownership rights. In other words what you own cannot be taken by force by another more powerful tribe, which was what happened until British law and order was introduced.  The second article English version:- "........undisturbed possession of their Lands and Estates Forests Fisheries and other properties which they may collectively or individually possess as long as it is their wish and desire to retain the same in their possession..." Obviously here we are talking about property rights.   The third and last article gives all people of New Zealand citizenship of England. Ha ha. Well those days are long gone.   When the tribes of New Zealand, the Confederation of Chiefs and the British Crown signed the treaty, morality based on justice replaced morality based on might, and British law entrenched the concept of permanency of claims to land, where previously, land was owned and occupied up until it was forcibly taken by a rival tribe. Queen Victoria's promise that all people in New Zealand would be granted the rights and duties of British citizens, changed this situation, and ownership became permanent. What is being protected by the treaty  are property rights. Property rights to land, and other property. It has nothing to with getting into university with lower grades, being able to fish introduced trout without a permit, being able to raid the coastline without heeding laws about how many one can take. It has nothing to do with camping out on a spot of land you like, and refusing to pay rates (when you do not even own that piece of land). It has nothing to do with allowing you your own special members of parliament. It has nothing to do with forcing other New Zealand people to consult with you about whether they can do certain things with THEIR own land. It has nothing to do with Maori getting special rights to the airwaves, coal, gas or fishing at depths that they never could have fished at. It has nothing to do with.........need I continue?  Where land has been taken unlawfully, it must be given back. Where it has been sold at foolish prices the case becomes more difficult. Plenty of people sell cars and houses at very low prices today as they are in need of the cash, but their ancestors cannot come back later and say "hang on guys I should have got more for that." Where it has been sold it should not be claimed back. That is as far as the Treaty goes and should go. To take it further than this is to take it out of it's original context and to twist it to suit politically correct purposes.  I am not at all even sure that any of the treaty should be considered valid. Since it is clearly outdated due to the fact that some of the parties in it no longer exist. Further to this, property rights are already protected under New Zealand law. We have broken away from England, and the monarchy in all but a technicality.   Let me also remind you that this document is beginning to be viewed as a legal document. But how can it be? If the English version significantly differs to the Maori version, then the Treaty surely is invalid, since neither side can be reasonably expected to know what the other sides version of the document says. And therefore are signing different agreements! If it is invalid, then it must be done away with entirely.  As I said earlier the Treaty was written in a specific context. Take it out of that and try to apply it today, and you get madness.Trogdor Strikes In The Night!  I had 19 fish. Now I have 18 fish and a skeleton. I found Mr Fish dead on the bottom with a hole through him yesterday. Shortly afterwards, I saw Trogdor feasting upon him. Trogdor strikes again.... with majesty!   Mum  Needs another operation, as the first one was not completely successful. Keep praying!   Question  Of interest and importance:- Do Maori deserve special privileges or have any more rights in this country due to the fact they were (debatably) the first inhabitants of New Zealand. I say no. Until this is spelt out and understood by all there will be racial disharmony in this country.   Smacking Children  I was troubled by the death of Corral. It was so sad. Unfortunately, with the death of Corral, cries for the outlawing of smacking have been heard. Bizarre. Did she get a smacked bottom and die? No; someone murdered her. The argument against smacking ones children is that it produces a violent society. Interesting! So how is it that in times past, where smacking was more acceptable, we had lower rates of murder and violent crime (and other crime) than we do now when fewer people use physical discipline. Once again stupid people are using unjustified arguments to attempt to bring about daft legislation. Give me strength!Mum  As many of you will know, my mum had her breast cancer surgery last Wednesday, and she is doing fine. We await the results to see if everything is tickety boo. Thanks for all the prayer.   Car Accident  Some of you may also know I had a car accident on the motorway last Tuesday. God protected me from harm, and I am now back at work.... somewhat poorer, and transportationally deficient.   Alfa Romeo  Dan and me went to look at an  urlLink Alfa Romeo  tonight. It is a replacement for my Mazda 626. I am really thinking of buying it. I'll keep ewes posted. Thanks for helping Dan!   Mafia  Awesome night on Sunday. Heaps of the youth from church went round to  urlLink Jono's , and we played Mafia. A good night was had by all! If you haven't played this game, get in touch, and I'll let you know when the next one is.    Lack of Posting  Anita has commented on the lack of posting on all blog fronts recently. In fact Dan has been the only one who really has been. What's going on? I've been too busy, but really want to get back into it. I just don't really have much to say though. Maybe I'll have an issue to bang on about tomorrow. Until then God bless ya'll.Nice - Go Maxim  A confused risk management culture    In every area except sex education, our young people are mollycoddled by a risk management culture. According to educational psychologist, mother and former teacher, Maria Schmetzer, when it comes to sex, "Young people are left in the position of making dreadful choices as there's no rules." Speaking at a public seminar in the South Island last weekend, Mrs Schmetzer added that "Children were making decisions they were not equipped to make at their age and parents had been made to feel incapable of guiding them."   Increasingly, childhood is being politicised through demands for more child rights, advocacy and safety. Risk-taking is no longer allowed as part of childhood - except when it comes to sexual expression and experimentation.   Today's children are growing up in a sterile and politically correct ('harm minimisation') culture largely bereft of risk, and managed by more and more state regulation and rights. Empowerment and participation rights have replaced former notions of protection, the role of parents is diminished, and the difference between 'child' and 'adult' continues to shrink.     Save Mart Clothes  Jono, Alisa, and cruised to Save Mart today. Ok this place rules. I bought 4 dress shirts and a pair of nice jeans for $35. Jono got more shirts for about the same. T-shirts are about $2 or $3. We then cruise to Rebel Sports just to check out something, and found T-Shirts (which just happened to have little famous brand labels on them) for $50 and more. Haha. Sucked in. Amazing how much you can save when you step down a little bit. Don't get me wrong, our shirts and stuff aren't gross, just not necessarily labels. Jono also did an amazingly cool good deed today. Check his blog to see what he did, when he decides to post about it.   Gold Nescafe Spoon  Ok this comes in as wackyness for the week stuff. I got a letter from Nestle the other day, with a gold (coloured) metallic spoon, which they told me was so I could have the perfect coffee when I used Gold Blend. Cool man. It said that "Your friend Mr Peek" had recommended me for it. Shot Mr Peek! Awesome stuff. Why did he recommend me? Was it because I was a stirrer? Or maybe because I like coffee....?The Hike  Absolutely amazing time. I went up the Billygoat track, which is very scenic. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Whilst up at the hut I read through II Timothy and Titus. Great books, and I was very encouraged. Shall tell you some stuff I learnt from them later. Anyways.... so much for assuming a peaceful and tranquil time would be had in preayer and meditation. There were 50-60 other people up there, so it was quite hectic, However, on the good side, I met a non-Christian guys, who was stoned (and possibly drunk by the amount of vodka he was consuming) and tried witnessing to him. he came from a Catholic background, and assumed that it was good works that save you. Well I didn't get far, but I pray that questions were left in Andrew's mind, which God will later use to bring him to his knees in repentance and faith. Further to this, I met a Christian youth group from Warkworth up there, and was encouraged as I talked with the leaders, and shared with them.  Isn't it funny how things turn out. Here I was hoping to have heaps of time to myself and God, and what did I get? Lot's of talking with others. But it was good for my soul to get away and see the beauty of the New Zealand bush, which is God's.   God taught me many things. One thing I really remembered. On the way up, I felt rather lonely, and also felt (10 minutes into the tramp due to asthma which made me sound like a sick cow) like going back to the car and forgetting the whole excercise. See, tramping is a bit like the Christian walk. When we make our faith individual, and try to 'go it alone' we often feel depressed, and downtrodden, as there is no one to encourage us to keep going. This is where Christian friends come in. They are there to encourage us to keep going, to rebuke us when we become slack, to laugh when we laugh, to cry when we cry. And of course we do the same for them.  Perhaps the Christian walk should not be done alone. Of course we do have God, but he has provided us with fellowship and a body so we can spur one another on.  On the way back, I took the Billygoat track, and as I set out, I made up my mind I would do it as quickly as I could. So I set out and blitzed the track in 2 hours. I was so stoked. The track is a '4 hour track', so I  was really happy, although my heels were pretty gashed up at the end of it. (Maybe something to do with the fit of jogging that came upon me for a little way).   Letter to the Editor  Very happy today. I got another letter in to the New Zealand Herald.   Here it is:-   Thom James tells the religious to stop forcing their opinions on others, by complaining about advertisements which are offensive to their faith. Then he contradicts himself by telling us, that those who are religious should just put up with the opinions of the secular society they live in, and should adapt accordingly. Why is it ok for the 'secular religion' to impose its views on everyone, when it is not ok for Christians to speak out on issues they feel strongly about. It couldn't be double standards could it?    Once again we are being told to shut up because our views do not conform to so called 'norms'. Once again "Enough already". Now let me predict a number of atheist/secular humanists writing in and saying that secular and religion don't go together. And then cue  other  Christians to write in and define religion (system of faith and worship), and then tell them they are religious. Yes that is a hint already.   Wrestling  Had a great evening before Greek last night. Me Hamish, and Paul checked out this funny as wrestling game for Playstation II. It was very choice. I can't remember it's name though.Car  I have a new car to replace the dead "Red Lemon". It is an Alfa Romeo 33 ie 1990. Tis very nice.  Looks nice, sounds nice, goes nice, is nice. Nice is such a naff word. But I shouldn't say that it wasn't very nice. Well have a nice day.Truth   There are few nudities so objectionable as the naked truth.  Agnes Repplier   Lou and Peanuts  Louise accidentally tasted peanuts (subtly hidden in a sauce on some dinner that people brought round for us today. Now she is at the emergency doctor. Raaaa! Did I or did I not say our family is having a rough time. Mum however is feeling quite good after the surgery yesterday. Awesome.Touch Rugby  We had our first practice for Tip Top touch rugby team tonight. It was really choice. And then to cap it off I played touch with the boys back in Rewa. I'll keep ewes updated on our progress. Next week is the first real game! Wowsers! It's good for the ol' fitness.Criticism  I don't like criticism! It can be so discouraging. Sometimes it's fair and other times it is not. Nevertheless that is not why I am writing. I found a great quote today. I shall share it with you.   To avoid criticism, do nothing, say nothing, be nothing.  - Elbert Hubbard  Criticism is part of being a person of opinions ideas and action! If you want to be loved by all people all the time, wake up, or have no opinions, and make no contraversial decisions. It's also a sure-fire way of never being famous/successful/useful to society.Reformed Churches  Our Japan team went to Pukekohe Reformed Church this morning. Very nice to visit a like-minded church. While it was different in some respects, it was good to hear the Word preached faithfully, and be amongst friendly and welcoming people.    Mum  My mum has her operation this Wednesday. Please be a praying.The Question  If the question is "Why?" what is the answer?   Jeremiah  I have lately been reading through this wonderful Old Testament prophecy. Some great things I have read.  Of the prophets... 23:28-29 "Their dreams and my truth are as different as straw and wheat. But when prophets speak for me, they must say only what I have told them. My words are a powerful fire; they are a hammer that shatters rocks."Imagine  (John Lennon) Imagine there's no heaven, It's easy if you try, No hell below us, Above us only sky, Imagine all the people living for today...  Imagine there's no countries, It isnt hard to do, Nothing to kill or die for, No religion too, Imagine all the people living life in peace...  Imagine no possesions, I wonder if you can, No need for greed or hunger, A brotherhood of man, Imagine all the people Sharing all the world...  You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one, I hope some day you'll join us, And the world will live as one.   Comrade Helen must have been listening to this kind of claptrap for too long.  Verse 1 - Get rid of religion, be secularists, and live for today. Verse 2 - World Government (by the otiose UN and various 'cheeky darkies'?) Verse 3 - No Possessions? Suspiciously like Communist Russia, the state owns everything. Like what we do with redistributing the money of the wealthy/hardworking in New Zealand. Of course greed and possessions go hand in hand, leading to hunger....  He's a dreamer! But unfortunately he is not the only one. Helen and her merry band of Commie's are gradually (?) changing this democracy into something more sinister (a dictatorship?). How dare they make major constitutional change without a mandate! They are arrogant, and all they are interested in is ploughing ahead with their dangerous agendas. Democracy is dying. They pay no heed to the people. They tell us what is good for us. They become parents to all of us. This country is rapidly going down the plughole.  I predict that unless there is a major change in thinking in this country we will lose freedom of speech within the next 30 years. It is already starting. Paul Holmes is an example of this. We will be arrested/shutdown for calling things like homosexuality a sin. We will be silenced for criticising governmen/other religions (with the exception of Christianity). Evil will be called good, and good will be called evil.   If we don't want this to happen we have some serious work to do.   I am scared.Raaaa  Raaaaaaaaaaaaa! I needed to say that!   Supreme Court Bill - an abuse of power   (from Maxim's Weekly Email Real Issues)  In a rare front-page editorial, the New Zealand Herald today described the passage of the Supreme Court Bill as an 'act of breathtaking arrogance' and 'nothing short of an abuse of power'. Certainly there is no mandate for this outrageous constitutional change that could be law from next week.   A 63 to 57 vote in favour of the bill (a 52 percent parliamentary majority) is not a sufficient benchmark to pass a law of this importance. Earlier this week, United Future decided to oppose the bill claiming a lack of consultation and public support for the legislation. The Greens are supporting Labour because they share that party's desire to deconstruct the foundations of our Westminster system. In the private sector, the Companies Act requires a 75 percent majority of shareholders to change a company constitution - but no such checks exist in parliament.   Attorney-General Margaret Wilson claims New Zealand is the laughing stock of 'mature' nations, but we need a more robust basis for change than this lame and vague call to 'grow up'. We are witnessing an ideological steamroller in action to sever a 162 year-old right of appeal to an esteemed independent and international court.   There were 315 submissions to the select committee; 40 percent supported the new court and 54 percent wanted to retain the status quo. Among 38 submissions from Maori interests, only 4 supported a Supreme Court. 85 out of 86 local authorities opposed the move, as did 75% of the 103 oral submissions.   Margaret Wilson - a list MP - will control the appointment process. Direct political interference is likely, as is some compromise of the critical separation of the Executive and Judiciary. The court would also make us vulnerable to pressure from a human rights-driven agenda and international law, and will nudge us closer to becoming a republic - perhaps the real motive behind the bill.   Concerned New Zealanders should voice their opposition directly to MPs and in letters to the editor. Maxim's website www.maxim.org.nz has a letter wizard with links to the editor of every paper in the country as well as contact details for each MP. A Citizens' Initiated Referendum has been started which provides a final hope for the public to have a say - we encourage you to sign the petition which is available at: http://www.act.org.nz/action/campaigns/privycouncil/privycouncil_petition.pdf You will need the free Acrobat reader programme to view the petition: you can download it from http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/readstep2.htmlOur family seems to be feeling God's hand heavily at the moment. Everything seems to just be getting worse. It's like you wake up and think, what can make today worse than yesterday. And I don't like living like that. I just want to hibernate and get away from everything.  (Maybe I shouldn't say God's hand, although I do believe in God's sovereignty, it seems that he is allowing our family to undergo many trials)  Well anyway, I'd like to register my sincere disapproval if that counts. I know it's meant to be good for you, but right now it feels very not good.  ok thats me for today.Wedding Songs  Lately I've been thinking of songs/hymns that can be sung at weddings. Here are a few ideas, I'll post a few more tomorrow.  1. It's no longer I that liveth. 2. Abide with me (fast falls the eventide) 3. Rock of Ages cleft for me (let me hide myself....) 4. The battle belongs to the Lord. 5. Lift high the (your?) cross. 6. Man of sorrows. 7. Take my life, and let it be. 8. Make me a captive Lord. 9. God moves in mysterious ways. 10. O God our help in ages past..  Maybe you guys (and girls) have some more suggestions....?TT Super Coffee Solution  At Tip Top we use a coffee solution to flavour some of our Ice Cream Products. Anyway it has a reputation for never getting bacteria counts in it. Yesterday I conducted a test on it. I innoculated a straight (and diluted) solution of it with  urlLink Enterobacter aerogenes , and then plated it with various agars. Violet Red Bile Agar (VRBA) takes 24 hours to incubate, so I was able to check my results to day. There were no colony forming units on the VRB plates, which means that the coffee killed the bacterial solution that I added to it. needless to say, I am conducting further tests, which I will brief you on as results come to hand.    Prayer  Today I left my Greek notebook in a plastic bag in the lunchroom. Last time I did this (yes I had to write all my vocab out again) it got chucked in the bin. I only realised I had done this  at the end of the day when I cam to collect it from my locker. I quickly walked down the corridor heading for the stairs to the lunch room, praying as I went. I prayed that God would have preserved my vocab book, as I was praying, a guy came out from one of the side doors and said "Hey Scott" and handed me a plastic bag containing my notebook, and my keys! God is so good. He answered my prayer as I was praying it. I was so grateful.A Good Quote from 'East of Eden'  As I mentioned, I am reading 'East of Eden' by John Steinbeck. An interesting read. Here is something that struck me.   "When our food and clothing and housing all are born in the complication of mass production, mass method is bound to get into our thinking and to eliminate all other thinking."    Save Mart  Jono and I have been to Save Mart twice this week. Go second hand clothing man! It's great. Dad reckons I'll never find a wife with my second hand clothes. Haha! Well maybe not one that's going to fritter away precious money on clothes eh?! No but seriously, you can get some nice as clothes very reasonably.   Finally  I'm real busy with preparation for the Japan missions trip. I will be away from 5 December to the 26th, so feel free to steal and borrow the Alfa if you are over 25. Please make sure it has a full tank of gas when I get back. Man it's real stressful, trying to get everything sorted before you go. Aaaarg! Greek has fallen by the wayside. Make sure that you do not totally dessert this blog site. I will be back, and this is not my final post before I go, and neither will my final post before I go be my final post, if you understand what I mean. Finally I must go to bed.Car Battery  My Silver Nissan Pulsar's Battery went flat today, because I left my lights on. Your Nissan Pulsar you ask? Yes I say. An email went round at work today saying that a silver nissan pulsar had left it's lights on. Anyway at the end of the day I went down to the carpark and attempted to start my car, and found that I had left my lights on. The lights of my kinda silver Alfa Romeo 33ie! Jono being the kind and wonderful person he is did not hesitate to come in from Manurewa and jump start my car. Jono you are a legend of a friend. Thanks.Affirmation  Pete has been at C.I.A teaching us about relationship building, and how to get to deeper levels in conversation. All very good stuff. He also showed a way of telling a two minute story from your life with a lesson point to it. Everybody  did one in front of the youth group, and we all 'affirmed' the person who had done it with clapping, and mentioning bits we found enjoyable. I know it probably sounds a bit  urlLink weord  , but it seriously is a good teacher to young people to be encouraging to others. It is also noticeable that they have become more encouraging in other areas! Yay!   A Wise Father  Well I was gutted for my Dad. His letter was cut and edited and stuck in Saturday brevities. Well I shall now unveil them in ther entirity.  1. Happy Families For the Social Development Minister, Steve Maharey to claim that sole-mother families are just as good as the traditional 'nuclear family' of mum, dad and the kids is to deny logic and the overwhelming body of evidence to the contrary.  I am surprised that the ex sociology lecturer from Massey University has allowed his research skills to become so rusty. A study entitled "Why Marriage Matters" co-authored by 13 leading social science scholars conclusively demonstrates that the 'nuclear family is more successful than other 'family' forms'. This is just one of many such reports and studies available to the minister.  Mr Maharey's assertions are both untrue and dismissive of the evidence. International research is clear that the two-parent married family remains society's greatest weapon against poverty, depression, child abuse, crime etc. No amount of politial correctness or spin doctoring can change the facts. S M Kennedy  2. Take your Partner So glad that Charlene Aplin has found another partner. I hear she wants to complete a hairdressers course and then train to be a social worker. What I'm not so ecstatic about is how the Charlenes' of this world and our dopey government expect the taxpayer to pick up the tab for their 'loose' definitions of what constitutes a family. If Mr Maharey and his government mates continue in their PC stance that all family forms are equal, then Charlene and her newly aquired social worker skills will be in hot demand in the future. S M Kennedy  Nice work Dad.   Quote of the Week  Winnie you get it mate. I was almost rolling on the floor with this one. I know I quoted it before but it's classic.  Mr Peters, well known for his late-night socialising, replied most of her [Turia's] Labour colleagues would be  "three sheets to the wind on a wine biscuit".     Person of the Week  My sister Lou! The bestest sister in the world! You are a real legend! A great encourager, a loyal friend, and the occasional kick up the bum when I muck up. Very good.Apologies  I have offended someone recently with my over strong language in some of my recent posts. This person had the grace to email about it personally which I appreciate. So I apologise for any offence caused, as it was not intended. I just happen to feel very strongly about the way things are going at the moment.   Dad  Dad wrote two letters to the NZ Herald today. Keep an eye on the papers, because they are real good letters. Here's hoping that one gets in.   Camp  I booked Tawharanui for the C.I.A camp in 2004 today. Looking forward to that! Memories man.    Fountain Pen  I have purchased myself a reasonably cheap fountain pen. Oh the joys of writing! It's amazing. I actually go to write hand writen letters, and notes now instead of using the computer. I'm almost tempted to chuck the blog, and start a written journal!   Reading  At the moment I am reading:- Jeremiah, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People, Stupid White Men, East of Eden, and "The Christian Ministry". Having trouble getting through it all though. I think I need to concentrate on one.   The Assasination of Common Sense File  I have just finished reading "Standing Tall", which I have found quite inspiring. Steve Farrar (the dude that wrote it), has a file which he calls "The Assasination of Common Sense File". This will be a new feature of my blog. My first entry into it is  urlLink this.  Well that is the last time I give to these IHC, and CCS! Is that or is that not scary?! It is a very silly idea.More Madness I  Check  urlLink this .  And for the lazy:-   "United Future had accepted from the outset that there was a diversity of families in society, and one would not be privileged over another.  "They're clear that they obviously want what they would argue as the traditional family - mum, dad and the kids - as part of the mix.  "They're not asking the commission ... set about to try to make that the preferred family form."  Mr Maharey said traditional families tended not to "hold together all that well in New Zealand". "   United Future you are gutless wonders. If that is all you have achieved in your time in parliament, you have been a waste of space. You are compromisers, and compromisers achieve nothing for the cause. I hope you enjoy Jacob's stew.   More Madness II   Our beloved Turia is  urlLink off her rocker again!    Social issues played a role in Maori health, she said, but people should take a broad view and accept that racism also played a part.  "I have not said that conventional Western medicine is absolutely not appropriate for Maori health. However, I also believe that there are other ways of improving health."     Mr Peters said a sound diet and housing were most important for Maori.  "What racist element in our society is forcing people to go down to Kentucky Fried Chicken or Pizza Hut or McDonald's and have Fanta and Coca-Cola by way of refreshments."  He asked if Mrs Turia would accept herself as evidence of what he was saying.  She replied: "I do not think I need to account to Mr Peters for my eating habits, nor do I expect him to account to me for his drinking behaviour."  Mr Peters, well known for his late-night socialising, replied most of her Labour colleagues would be "three sheets to the wind on a wine biscuit".    1. What part of our health system makes it harder due to racism for Maori to get access to it. The word 'tripe' comes to mind. 2. At least Winston has a bit of humour.   More Madness III   Check  urlLink this    Chinese women may be using abortion as a form of contraception, a new study suggests.  Research by Auckland University health academics shows there has been a large rise in the number of Asian women seeking abortions.  "Abortion may be used for family planning rather than as a back up for contraceptive failure," researchers said in a report published in the New Zealand Medical Journal today.   1. Raaaa!Steve Maharey   Read  urlLink this . For those too lazy, I will quote some of the significant bits.   " Families are great, says Social Development Minister Steve Maharey, but sole-mother families are just as good as the traditional "nuclear family" of mum, dad and kids. "   "I know of no social science that says a nuclear family is more successful than other kinds. It's whether you have a loving, nurturing family."   "A sole-parent family isn't inadequate, it's the result that matters, so we are not going to reinforce any particular kind of family structure."    Mr Maharey. You are a fool. You are deceitful, and you are talking codswallop. Your words are blatantly untrue, and you speak rebellion against the Lord God Almighty. It is He that has instituted the family. He says what is right; not you or your evil scheming friends. All children need a father and a mother who are committed to each other in marriage fullstop amen, end of story.   Sole-Parent "families" are not ok, and should not be seen as just as good. They are not. Economically and emotionally they are inferior to God's standard. Economically, because the tax payer very often has to compensate for the lack of the father. Emotionally, because all children need a dad to be a role-model of masculinity.  God save us from these idiots.So much to tell you!  I have had some cool thoughts recently about what I want to post, but it is late, so a few at a time eh?   Defence  Ok I just watched the Aussie NZ game. Defence seemed to win the game. Ok I am pretty rugby illiterate, but from my perspective the Aussie defence was impregnable. Defence is so important. You might be an average team with offence, but if you have superb defence, you are going places. Well tis a thought anyway. May not be true.   Bible Society Touch Tournament  Jono and I went and played for Trinity (yay go Trinity!) at the Bible Society Touch tournament. The team played quite well, but were thrashed in all games we played. We weren't bad at all, just struggled putting  things together at times. It was all good fun though.    Person of the Week  Steve Farrar author of "Standing Tall - How a Man Can Protect His Family". I will quote some extracts from this wonderful book for men. In fact I will do it now. I can do it. I will do it nine times. Actually I will just do it once.   Quotes of the Week  From the book mentioned above:-   "... a community that allows a large number of young men (and women) to grow up in broken families, dominated by women, never acquiring any stable relationship to male authority, never acquiring any set of rational expectations about the future.... that community asks for and gets chaos."  - Patrick Moynihan as quoted by Steve Farrar.   "A society cannot survive without male leadership. For when male leadership ceases to be a reality in the home, we are only one generation away from anarchy in the streets. This is the direction that our nation is going. If we lose male leadership in Christian families, then this country is finished for sure."   And lastly:-   "I believe that when you look at every major pressing social issue in this country; whether it's teenage pregnancy, child abuse, drive-by shootings, teenage suicide, or the divorce rate, and reduce each of those problems down to their lowest common denominator, you will find in each case the same root cause. That cause is a lack of male leadership."    Men  Men, we really need to put our heads up and start being leaders. But to be leaders we need to be worthy of following. Let's get to it! It's our God given role, let's fulfill it in a godly manner, and start to reverse the social chaos we find our country in.Tomorrow   Tomorrow is a very special day. It is so because I am declaring it to be so, and with your support it will be. Tomorrow I propose we celebrate one of the results of diversity. One of the sections of society that is not often given a lot of positive thought. This section of society is one which is directly responsible for all the ills we now face in New Zealand. It is responsible for abuse of children, and women. It is responsible for Maori unemployment and crime. It is responsible for the ill-health of Maori and Pacific Islanders. It is responsible for women having lower pay. It is responsible for failure in education. It is responsible for everything bad, from the toothpaste cap not being on properly to the fact that university education is expensive. In fact blame everything on this group. It might not be true, but at least they’ll sit there and take it, and still pay taxes and be a mainstay to the infrastructure of this country. Of course I am talking about the Middle-Class Heterosexual White Man. Yes Middle-Class Heterosexual White Man. Tomorrow is a day in honour of him who is the root cause of sin in the world. The real story of the fall is as follows:-  God created the world. It was full of mainly women (especially black lesbian women) and few men (but no white men). There was peace harmony and tranquillity with little talking (as indeed there can only be when women rule). Men (and they were mainly black with a few Asians here and there) dutifully followed the directions on home improvement, and gardening, of the head woman Helen. One day Satan tempted a man (named Jim) suggesting that if he decided to take initiative, and do his best, and even try to overthrow Helen, he would know everything. This man fell for the temptation. Instead of knowing all, he found his skin colour had changed to a pale reflection of what it used to be. It was white. Somehow this man multiplied and there became more of these pale skinned sinful creatures. So forever more, white man was a sinful blight on the rest of sinless society. And here we are today still struggling with the sin of Jim, negatively effecting the sinless sections of society.Frazzled and Frustrated!  Just finished a hard day at Tip Top. Started at 2, but things got hectic, and thus finished late. I hate finishing late on the late shift, because it puts my sleep patterns funny. I know that if I finish at 10, and get home soon after and go straight to bed, I can continue pretty much as normal. But on hectic days, brain won't slow down when I come home. Oh well.Person of the Week  Dad wins! I was having a real good conversation with him the other day. It's great to have such a wise father. And I'm not greasing, because he won't see this!   Quote of the Week   Always forgive your enemies; nothing annoys them so much.  Oscar Wilde   A Good Woman  Well I'm sure that caught 50% of my readers attention.   I have noticed and read with increasing interest, the letters to the New Zealand Herald editor written by Amanda McGrail. She has some very good things to say. I have already quoted her on my blog. Check this letter out:-   Alexis Stuart's call to dissolve the Ministry of Women's Affairs is right on the money. What makes a few women in Wellington think it is their noble task to define womanhood for the rest of us?   That's exactly what they are tring to do, lest too many women make the "wrong" choice - like being a mother, for instance; or even worse, being a wife.  They want me to choose power, but I'd prefer love any day, and I suspect most honest women feel the same. Bring on the privatisation of female identity I say. Ruth Dyson can keep her "economic autonomy" and her emotional wilderness all to herself.George Bush  I constantly hear of his lack of intelligence (IQ), his illiteracy, and various other attacks on his character. Isn't it so easy to dismiss someone by throwaway lines like these. I would suggest that if he was illiterate and stupid, he wouldn't be where he is today. Furthermore, IQ does not equate with 'thinking'. I know some very 'intelligent' people who cannot think. And then I know some people of average/below average intelligence, who are thinkers.   What I admire about Bush is his strength of convictions. See  urlLink this . Here we have a man who is willing to commit possible political suicide, for what he believes is right. God bless him, and may he continue in power to a second term.Being Straight Up  Today we are in an age of beating around the bush. I am attempting to speak my thoughts (in a gracious manner) and not lie by pretending I think things are ok when they are not. For example, at work when people start bagging George Bush (whom I unashamedly admire) I intend to tell them what I think of him. It's kind of something I don't really do with people other than my friends, but I intend to start being honest with all people in all areas. (I think my usual silnce is to do with wanting to please everyone and wanting everyone to like me... which explains why I don't have a problem speaking my mind with friends, because they already do like me.)   Pride   "....an exorbitant demand that others believe the lie we have made ourselves believe about ourselves."  Thomas Merton  (I am not by the way suggesting I agree with everything this guy says...)Tip Top Touch Team  Well we got thrashed. 6 - 0. We had heaps of subs which was good, but most of us only got 5 - 10 mins max. One of our real dumb moments was subbing when the opposition was on the offensive. Oh great! Give them a hole so they can score. But we weren't the types to let one failure stop us from repeating the same mistake! Oh no!   I had 5 minutes of glory on the field. My first minute on, I gave away a penalty, and in my last, I scored the try that wasn't. Gutted. I had cut through the defence, and got to what I thought was the line, and touched down. But no! The cones did not mark the try line! No way, they marked the 5 metre line. But on the whole quite a positive outcome. It means there is only one way we can go..... well; here's hoping anyway.So Much To Do  There are so many things I want to do, but I just keep getting put off by the big list, because I can't ever see me getting it done. I'm intimidated by what I want to do. I feel like I am achieving next to nothing at the moment, and at the same time being so busy I am physically drained. It's very weird. I want to be useful/have an impact on society, but feel powerless in the face of such evil. Perhaps smaller targets or at least smaller projects are easier to attain, thus giving more satisfaction and sense of achievement when they are attained. I think investing time in people can pay huge dividends. I've already seen this in a small way through leadership in C.I.A youth. Not only this but I have seen God's power and his faithfulness in answering prayer. It is easy to become despairing as we see the battle raging and being lost on all fronts. But there are pockets where truth is being upheld and is winning. And it needs to be remembered that truth cannot fail. In the end there will be victory, for God cannot be shaken, and he scoffs at evildoers.       (I just re-read that paragraph, and there is a lot of hopping round in it; but that's ok. I'll leave it like that, because it explains exactly how I feel.)Here's a Goodie   Suppose you were an idiot and suppose you were a member of Congress. But I repeat myself.  Mark Twain  Congress and parliament could be switched perhaps?Trogdor  Trogdor seems off his tucker at the moment. Perhaps this could be to do with the fact that I am missing four fish? I don't know but he seems to be more active chasing others round but less hungry.    Quote of the Week   Hard work spotlights the character of people: some turn up their sleeves, some turn up their noses, and some don't turn up at all.  Sam Ewing   Speakers in the Alfa  The speakers that were originally in the Alfa I just bought are 'lacking........at best'. This intolerable situation will soon change. Instead of two 'Ark class speakers' I have purchased four speakers off the blogger (or is non-blogger more appropriate) Jono, and will probably install them at some point in the next week. Jono has already installed my Blaupunkt CD player. Cheers Jono. Soon Brahms' Clarinet quintet will be pumping in the Alfa! Yay!Agendas  Everybody has an agenda. That's what dad says to me. It's an interesting thought. What is my agenda? Why am I writing this? What is your agenda.. why are you reading it? Why do you do the things you do? I wish I could see everyone's agendas. That would make life so easy.   But I can't so I just wonder. And I think about it often. What really makes the people I know tick?  I want to conform my own agendas to the only worthwhile one. That of God's. I want to see things as they really are. I want to be caught up with his good news so much that I can't help but tell it.Alana has a blog!  Check  urlLink it  out. How long will it last.....?!   Back from Japan  When I have a bit of time I will give you a more full like report. Until then, you'll have to  urlLink wait it out .   Agendas  I wanna have a bit of a reflection on these at a later date.Of Japan  It is seriously hard to get at the computer here. Sorry.   Last night Kensuke (the youth pastor here) Rosa, Lou, and one of the Japanese guys from Chiba (near Tokyo) and myself had a bit of a jam session in the church. It was pretty cool. Kensuke is an awesome pianist. We played many of the old favourites, like `Shepherd of my soul, `Saviour like a shepherd lead us`, etc etc. Rosa taught some of us a Samoan slap dance. It was the jams! Although Lou being the hard out she is ended up with bruises all over her hands. Hahaha....lemons.  On Friday we travelled up to a fishing village on the coast which looked out to Hokkido. Freezing weather, snow right up to the water. On the way back we had a massive as snow fight. We were in the front van and we asked Martin to stop the van so we could have a snow fight. Lou, Rosa, Geraldine, Madeline and myself were in the van, and we decided to work as a team and punish the other guys. Martin stopped our van on the side of the road, and went and told the other vans who stopped behind us some cock and bull story about the van overheating. Meawhile we had all got out of the van and were secretly stockpiling and manufacturing snowballs at the front of the van. Janet came at us with a lone snowball, and beat a hasty retreat after being pummeled with copious quantities of snowballs. Others faced a similar fate. Anna looked much the worse for wear after her brief encounter with our `blitzkrieg`, as did Jesse. It was with a great sense of satisfaction that our team regrouped in the van.  God bless ya`ll and have an awesome Christmas. ScottyCrotchety  I am a little crotchety today. Things are starting to get to me. Partially because I was kept awake late last night. It`s taking a big effort for me to be pleasant to everyone! But I will be pleasant to you my long suffering readers.    Rest Home  We sung at a rest home today. It was sad. Here before us were people standing on the edge of the precipice `Christless eternity`, and they didn`t know it. If this doesn`t make you sad,what will?Raaa  This computer has a thing for Japanese characters. The Japanese below should read `avoid`.   Pleasantaries  It is very nice weather over here. The snow has almost all melted now. Aomori is quite a nice (see post on nice) place. It is built on a large plain surrounded by about 270 degrees of hills/snowy mountains. The harbour and sea surrounds the rest of this large plain. It would be even nicer if it houses and man made structures didn`t fill up the whole valley. Oh well.   Missing Home  I am really missing the wide open spaces of home. One of the first things I plan when I arrive home is a hike in the bush. There is nothing like that here seemingly. Even the `country` is pretty built up. What was scary were the train rides up from Tokyo. Looking out the window, so much of the country was built upon. I need some space, and the beauty of God`s creation.  Oh yeah.... I miss you guys too!Hello!  Gidday peoples. Finally I get a chance to use the computer.It is in reasonably high demand, when it is actually working. A few important things have happened since I last posted. Yay for the Americans! They finally caught that evil wretch Saddam. Good job. All of Iraq celebrates! Well all except Saddam`s home town.  In Japan news, things are ticking along nicely. We are now in Aomori. Things are starting to get quite busy, and some of us (including yours truly) have a had a bit of sickness. Nothing that a bit of sleep and overdosing on Vitamin C can`t cure. There was quite a bit snow on the ground when we first came up here but the weather has been real warm, and most of the snow has melted.  The team is getting on reasonably well, with only a few injuries from fights.    Quote of the Week   `I will show her who is the man around here`  from film Bad Attitudes （ａｖｏｉｄ）Sendai  Well we're off to Sendai today. We have a concert there tonight, and then we are cruising up to Aomori. Apparently it is a bit chilly there, and there has been snow recently.   We went to Disneyland on Monday. I must say it was a pretty good experience, and it was amazing just seeing the lengths the designers had gone to to make you suspend disbelief and feel as if you are in another world. On the down-side, the wait-times for the rides were prohibitive. Most rides took over an hour of queing, which was frustrating. However we sang songs to pass the time, which seemed to amuse the people around us.   The night parade was especially spectacular. Lights and sound and (you get the idea...), but all in all, if you want good rides and fun go to Rainbows End! Haha.   C.I.A  It's great to have a little break from C.I.A, but I am really rearing to get back into it. I have some ideas which I am enthusiastic to implement. Breaks always do that to me, althought generally I don't complete half of what I want to when I get back, because of...procrastination.Saturday  Interesting incidents:-  1) We met a man biking down the road shaving. As he past us he did the Japanese 'bob/bow thing. You had to be there but it was terribly funny.   2) The 1st concert went very well. I think we really exceeded our (realistic) expectations, which was really nice. We talked with some really cool folk, and one couple are coming down to NZ next year. Another guy I was talking to gave me a couple of Japanese cd's which was pretty cool.    Sunday  Church was really different. It was quite formal, and had sort of a more ritualistic feel. For example there was lighting of candles at the beginning of the service and snuffing them out at the end. Also there are nice stained glass windows, and the building has a real 'church' look.   Peter preached and was translated as he went. So that was a new experience. It breaks the sermon up into bite size sentences. Sometimes the Japanese is much longer than the English, which does make you wonder what extra apologies/corrections/explanations/"what he really meant was' etc are going on.  We went into "Electric City" today. Wall to wall people, and so many good goodies to buy, but unfortunately it was Sunday, so I had to restrain myself. We talked to a couple of people. One was an older man who was trying to learn English, but found us hard to understand because he was learning in an American accent. Another was one of the girls handing out tissues. For those of you who haven't heard of this, there are people over here who are paid to hand out little packets of tissues. Some of our team members kept coming back, and some had 8 or 12 little tissue packets. Also we went into this lift which said it could hold 9 people, but we had it beeping with 6 of us on board. Fatties.  Please remember "if it's supposed to be possessive it's just i-t-s, but if it's gunna be a contraction it's i-t-apostrophe-s." ..........."scalliwag"Japan  Blogging to you from Ichikawa. Te flight over here was long, but not too tedious. First impressions of this country are all positive, although as Jesse rightly puts it, it is a bit of a sensory overload. It's funny seeing advertising with Japanese people in the pictures. Also of note is the nature of the Japanese people we have seen so far. Amazingly polite describes them. It's quite unlike walking around in New Zealand. One guy in a suit carried my sister's suitcase down a flight of stairs, and another carried Madeline's.   Also the streets are really different. They are sort of a cross between a street and a footpath. Really funny.  The food so far has been super great. We had these sort of bun things, with custardy cream in them. Oiiiiiii! Jesse and I are sharing a room. We have matresses on the floor. Really comfortable, and the duvets are reeeeeally warm.   OOOO! I forgot. The trains. At each station, there is this cheesy music kinda like "do do do dee dee da" (if ya know what I mean), and then this voice in Japanese and then a real cheesy american accent telling you what the next stop is, and to get on the train before the doors close. The trains arrive on time (!) and are clean fast, and comfortable. Gotta say I like the nice backside heaters that the seats have. A nice touch.   Over and Out!Life Changing Events  Is there such a thing as a life changing event? I can think of one, although when it comes to others, my mind goes blank. Is any single event (apart from the one) something which is enough to completely change a life? Is not the changing of a life, one small but determined step at a time. Never go to something expecting to be changed by it. Go to something, and then change yourself because of it. We are the product of our decisions (to a point), and each little decision we make, creates the person we are. So I would probably say there are few real life changing events. A changed life is more about sweat and determination rather than a single event.    One Man  Can one man make a difference? I was discussing this with a friend some time back on a bush walk. (Incidentally bush walks are very good for conversation.) Are we in a world in which it is increasingly more difficult for one man to make a difference? In past times, we had our Napoleon's, our Washington's etc. Is it harder today to make a significant difference in the world? I don't know the answer, but I feel swamped, and powerless to make any difference in this world, except in the small sphere God has placed me in. Hopefully there I can be of use, and maybe if all of us Christians do the same, some headway may be gained.Stuff I meant to post but I didn't but now I am.  Hmm that title reminds me of a song. "Somebody told me that you're so stoopid, but I didn't believe them, but now I believe them." But anyway today I am going to post stuff I should have already posted.   Work  An interesting thing happened the other day. Not that something interesting happening is something of note. My existence is interesting and I don't like the concept of boredom. Perhaps I should say something unusual happened the other day.   Anyway. I went to my locker one morning, and found that my combination lock was gone. Weord. Especially weird since I had definately locked it the night before. Since I don't keep anything of value in my locker, I thought little of it. However the next day I went to my locker to get my overalls and found that my combination lock was on it again. "Oh good" I thought. But it was not all good. The combination had been changed, which is easy enough to do with these locks. Thankfully I got help from an expert lock technician (read locker thief unless you are PC) who showed me how to work out combinations. Very interesting.   Taumaranui  Jono is now back. He drove up from Wellington on Tuesday. I decided to drive down and meet him. It was a beautiful trip. I loved the scenery. We met in Taumaranui and had dinner. Nice litttle town actually. I wouldn't mind living there. I even picked up a hitchhiker on the way down. The Alfa seems to manage hills better than other cars I've taken for drives. It effortlessly tore up hills even in 5th. Nice. Jono had a minor accident on the way to meeting me, but thankfully, both him and the car were ok to get back. God is very good.   Tennis  I gave my little brother James (11) a game of tennis the other morning. Wowsers. He is good. I did manage to win, but he is an excellent player for his age. I'd actually like to play doubles with him. If anyone wants a game let me know!Character   You cannot dream yourself into a character; you must hammer and forge yourself one.  James A. Froude (1818 - 1894)Grand Canyon  Score! My Grand Canyon rave from yesterday is in the Herald today. Pity the person editing it lengthened the first sentence. It was lacking punch. Oh well better in than out anyway.Prayer Matter  Please pray for my mum. She's in hospital at the moment due to a negative reaction to the chemo. She has a low white blood cell count and has an infection.Grand Canyon  Check A12 of the Herald, and then read on.   Don't be lazy now.....   I read Andrew Gumbel's comment about the creationist book on the Grand Canyon with great interest. I loved the way that it 'scientifically' dismissed the creationist perspective without providing any evidence or reason for it being an 'absurd theory' and ‘anti science’ other than it disagreed with broadly accepted interpretations. If the theory is so absurd as he and many scientists would say, why do they bother to publicly attack it and attempt to discredit it? Perhaps it isn’t as absurd as they are telling us. The only 'anti-science' viewpoints that I could see in the article were the viewpoints held by 'rationalists' and 'scientists' who seem to think their theory is fact and above all criticism. That's not science guys.Quote of the Week  This week is the Kennedy clan's motto.   "Avise le fin"  translated.....  "Consider the end"   What a great motto... must be from a great clan comprising of great individuals.Manage or Lead?   "Management is doing things right; leadership is doing the right things."   Peter Drucker and Warren Bennis  And;   "Effective Management without effective leadership is like straightening deck chairs on the Titanic"    Trogdor  Trogdor has a cave. I made it for him this afternoon. He is lurking there now. He is ready to devour those who dare to pass.Rain  I felt it was going to rain today, and it did. I don't know if I should be scared that I can predict weather better than weather forecasters.   Progress  My goals are ticking along nicely. I am really getting the hang of Excel, and have made up some good spreadsheets for things at work. It is an amazingly useful programme, and I am only touching the surface of what it can do.  Book 1: The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People. Book 2: The Purpose Driven Life. Book 3: The Christian Ministry. Bible Book: I Peter  That's me at the moment!   Youth Leaders Meeting  Dwaine, Louise, Kirsten and myself had our first C.I.A meeting for this year last night. It was  urlLink sooo good . There are two main things we want to do better than last year. The first is creating a servant-hearted youth group. the second is encouraging our 'core' to invite their friends to youth.... so we can preach to them hehehe. God has really blessed us with a united leadership team.   Font Size  Why has my font size to previous posts changed?BBC's silent treatment  urlLink here    14.01.2004    The BBC is to broadcast a live radio performance of an orchestra playing four-and-a-half minutes of silence.   John Cage's seminal work 4'33" will be the highlight of a concert on Radio 3.   The piece consists of four minutes and 33 seconds' worth of nothing. In readiness for the performance, Radio 3 bosses will have to switch off their emergency back-up system - designed to cut in when there is an unexpected silence on air.   The work has never been performed by an orchestra or broadcast on national radio in Britain before.   The BBC described Cage's piece, written in 1953, as "ambient silence".   It will be broadcast as part of the station's annual Composer Weekend.   TV viewers will be able to tune into BBC Four an hour later and watch the orchestra "performing" the piece.    Well for goodness sake. The words 'lost' and 'conned' come to mind. Presumably you'll have all the snobby musicians attending/listening, and talking about it as if it were some great work of art. "Oh I liked it better when the London Symphony performed it." Yeah go on.Hmmm  I could be bothered, and then I couldn't.Quote of the Week    Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.  Mark Twain   Goals  For those of you who don't know me, and couldn't tell I wasn't serious in my last post......I think goals/resolutions are a wonderful idea. Getting around to them is another thing. However when you've got Dad on your back like I did, they better be forthcoming. So I have come up with my list of goals for 2004.   My English teacher once wrote on an essay of mine "Say more with less". It was a great help. More delving, less froth. Less width more depth. Well that is a maxim that can be transferred from my writing to my life. Do less, but do it better. So this year I am cutting all the things I have been burdened with in the past year. I am refocusing on where I think God has called me, and I will put the time that I have gained (by cutting out other activities) doing a better job of the things I am doing.  Here is my goal list for 2004:-  Spiritual ·	I will read through a minimum of 12 good solid Christian books this year. ·	I will aim to read and study a book of the Bible per month. ·	Every month on the last day of the month I will crack open the old prayer box. Intellectual ·	I will aim to get a good understanding of Excel. Work ·	Work my hardest to God’s glory, not for men.  ·	I would like heaps of opportunities to share my faith, and I want to take the opportunities I get. Physical ·	At least once per week I will go for a walk of at least 30 minutes. Financial ·	I aim to add $x to my term deposit savings account. ·	I will keep an expenditure record to insure I stick to my financial plan for 2004. C.I.A. ·	This year I want to see the C.I.A touch team set up along with T’s and weekly practices. ·	Continue the relationship focus of C.I.A, but get to deeper levels with the young guys ·	I want to see C.I.A become a more servant focused group. ·	I want to see friends of the young people beginning to attend regularly. ·	This year I want to encourage young people to attend evening church. ·	To find two young people and begin to train them up for leadership. Other ·	I will continue writing my personal journal.   All attempted relying on God's grace.Happy New Year  Happy New Year everyone! God bless you all.  As yet I haven't made any New Year's Resolutions. I am finding this difficult. You see, the trick is to set these resolutions with low expectations. To many people forget this. They try the biggies, like stop smoking, exercise three times a day etc etc.... and  when  they fail they get depressed. Why not be easy on yourself, and set low expectations which you won't be so upset about when you constantly fall short of them. Like "This year I hereby declare that I shall at some points of time not smoke".   Alternatively set such vacuous resolutions, that you can't help but keeping them. For example "This year I plan to watch less TV." That my friends is a very sneaky resolution. Less TV eh? Less TV than what?  Or how about "This year I plan to be more proactive." More proactive than what or whom? No matter what you do you can be assured that you must be keeping it.Breaking Up Is So Hard To Do  The split was acrimonious. I wanted some space. I needed space. I got it.  However as time went by I realised that our differences were few, and we really couldn't part just like that. We'd been together for over 6 months, and although there was the occasional cross word, generally we agreed on things.  So the long and short of it is that after a bit of counselling, me and my blog are together again, and stronger than ever.   Letter to the Herald  In  urlLink this  perspectives piece, Jane Norton (whom has frequented my blog and caused a stir previously) tells of Noah being raped by his sons in the Old Testament.  Here is my letter:-   I would have thought that as an Auckland lawyer, Jane Norton would ensure that she gets her facts straight, however, not so. In her perspectives piece on censorship, she tells us of the Old Testament tale of Noah being raped by his sons. One wonders if this is the "Norton" translation of the Old Testament, because it sure isn't in any of the translations I have. It is great to have free speech and dialogue, but it is important that we also get the facts right.   Scott Kennedy Manurewa    Alfa  Has been running like a goat, but has had a bit of a tune up and is purring. Look out for it in a town near you.    MRI Scan  Mum's MRI scan results were given to us today. They had thought the cancer had moved into the spine, but fortunately they were wrong. Praise God.The End  And Scott felt no more need to blog anymore, and he lived happily in peace.  The End.Dad Attacks the Humanists  ‘Religious’ Schools   I am amazed that Paul Litterick, Secretary NZ Association of Rationalists and Humanists, fails to see that public state schools are also ‘religious’ in nature. So called secular schools espouse the humanist belief that man (individually or collectively), not God, determines values, and that these values are based upon prevailing circumstances. Humanists enthusiastically, dare I say even ‘religiously’, seek to remake the world in man’s image.  Nobody thinks without making assumptions. Those assumptions are a person’s religion. It makes no difference whether God or man says those assumptions are true, as long as people accept them without question. No religious leader ever spoke more dogmatically than humanists speak. Yet in the name of church – state separation humanists have largely censored from textbooks all religious doctrines but their own. Not all religions are institutionalized in churches. Not all sectarians believe in the supernatural. Not all catechisms are theistic.  The real problem is not one of ‘religion’ but choice. All taxpayers contribute to the funding of education and should therefore be entitled to send their children to a ‘religious’ school that supports their beliefs.   Shane Kennedy (in reply to a member of the rationalists and humanists association who said that only state schools are free of dogma and should be supported with government funding.)   Silver Streak is Struck   urlLink More  on that later.   C.I.A Camp  Remember to tune in next week for our  urlLink special expose  on the C.I.A campQuote   Those who live by the sword... get shot by those who don't  I got this one from Hannah Leslie.   Dan and Michelle's for dinner  I did not as the heading suggests eat Dan and Michelle's house. However I did attend a dinner at Dan and Michelle's house. And a very good cook is Michelle. She made hamburgers, and potato wedges. Very yumy. Me and Dan got to a lot of interesting talking. The results of which will probably be published on one or both of our blogs in the near future. Watch out!Brash - from Maxim "Real Issues"  Special rights for Maori - and the UDHR   Don Brash's Orewa speech has sparked discussion about Maori rights. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), written in 1948, assumed that human rights are universal. They apply to everyone equally. They are not a means to right past wrongs but to prevent future ones.   If some Maori have been treated unjustly by the state in the past - and they have - those injustices must be put right. The Waitangi Tribunal was established to achieve that. But we still have a problem. Human rights theory has become about the protection of groups, particularly if a group is believed to have suffered past injustices. The Prime Minister adopts this position in an article on the Treaty in The Press (19 February).   The traditional view, and certainly Dr Brash's view, is that the law is about protecting individuals. For hundreds of years that has been the basis of common law. The Prime Minister confuses individual equality before the law with group identification. Dr Brash, following his understanding of law, claims that people in need are more justly treated as individuals than members of a group.   Underlying the debate between the leaders is a huge philosophic and legal problem. Groups are political constructs. Group identities might seem real enough, but they are shadowy formulations and deeply at odds with our cultural imperative to treat individuals as individuals, regardless of their ethnic background. The fixation with "group identity" is, in fact, an attempt to create a different kind of society - one where dignity resides in group identity rather than in our understanding of common humanity as envisaged in the UDHR.    Brash's 'Lucky' Break  I was thinking (strange I know) that Don Brash was mad to go to Waitangi. And then I heard the news about mud being chucked on him, and I had hope. Here is a politician who has a brain, and might just have a chance against Helen. Excellent work brother. And no I do not think his speech is divisive. It is naive to call it so. To treat people equally has never been divisive.    Maori Affairs  From  urlLink here    "Back off, back off," a policeman told the protesters. "Tell your people to back off."   The eyeball contact continued as protesters harangued police, telling them to "f... off, this is our land".   As the confrontation continued attention was diverted to a lone protester who had climbed 40m to the top of a tree where he lashed a Maori sovereignty flag.   He drew cheers of support from the protesters as he waved at them from the tree top.....................  He left the flag tied to the top branch and when the protesters were told it was flying far higher than the New Zealand flags on the pole, there was resounding cheer from the protesters.      And that my friends is why there will never be peace in New Zealand. The more you give the worse it will get. What they want is something I will never give. This is my country and I ain't leaving. I belong here; it is  my  home.  One fellow rung up talkback the other day and said that there was nothing good brought about by colonization.... nothing. Presumably he forgot about the telephone.   Colonialism  It's not all bad. Schools might have brainwashed us to think so, but it's not that black and white. More on this later... maybe.   Brainwashing In Schools  You know, recently I have become aware of how brainwashed some of my aquaintances have become. Not all mind, but some, especially the ones who have gone only to state schools. I think my dad is responsible for the way I think. In saying this I mean that I believe the reason I have a Christian worldview is because dad taught me. But it wasn't mainly through a sit down and write down what I say method of teaching. It was through conversation and discussion around the table or in his office. It's great to have a thinker for a father. He really 'sees' behind the obvious into the underlying.  Peter Boyd also has a role to play for helping me fight the university brainwashing. Indeed I never wrote one essay to please my markers in my time at uni. I always wrote from a Christian perspective. Fight against the world! Everything is a spiritual battle. Every movie, every article, every speech is part of it. It is either for or against God. Everyone has a message, and it's either for or against God. Who are you going to serve? It may be the devil or it may be the Lord but you're gunna have to serve somebody. Thanks Bob.   Touch   urlLink Dan  Jono (I'm not linking him because he doesn't blog anymore) Dwaine, James, Mark, Matthew, Boss, George Cain and myself played touch at hillpark today. I felt faint after about two minutes on because the sun. But in the end it turned out to be a cracker game. Try of the day had to be Dan's run away (after sneakily running through the defence) try. The game for me and James was topped of by a sour chill (recommend these for a hot day) (thanks Tip Top I'll have a raise), and cold coke. Mmmm. And that my friends is what Waitangi day should be about.As Promised  Good old Dora  wrote to the Herald about focus on NZ Idol, when other musicians had been honing their craft for years. Yes. Well this folks is what I want to talk about. Why is it that the public finds mediocrity (in this case the people on NZ Idol) more interesting than brilliance. Now some may say I am biased, and that those in NZ Idol are brilliant. I find it hard to compare this 'brilliance' with brilliance that is trained to the milli-second, the kind of brilliance that takes 6 hours a day for years. Why is it that people will hear  Chopin's "Minute Waltz" and apathetically say 'oh yeah', or even worse 'boring'; but they will hear Robin (who's tuning is lacking at best) on New Zealand Idol, and go wild? Is there more to the modern music scene than music? It seems so. Now to qualify this. I am a fan of some modern music, and listen often to contemporary Christian music, although in complete honesty I find that my mind and emotions are far more stimulated by classical music, particularly by Beethoven and Brahms. I challenge you if you have not really tried before to start listening to classical music. It takes an effort at first. Perhaps that is why it isn't popular. But the effort you spend listening to it eventually becomes less and less, and you open up to yourself a whole new world of possibilities which can provide many hours of stimulation, soothing... or riling up if you choose the right pieces!  Related topics that I will cover in more detail soon:- - cricket, democracy,Prayer Meeting  Just been at the Covenant's monthly prayer meeting. Hmm. There were about 20 people there. Max. Ok I'll count. Bother, lost count, but it wasn't higher than 20. I was the only person between the age group of 12 to 35. This in a church that is over 200 people. It's quite sad.    Letters to the Editor   From yesterday's Herald:-  Palestine caught in a corner  Palestinian threats of retaliation against the killing of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin are empty and hollow. It's not that I think the Palestinians won't kill more people. They've already got a written declaration of war that demands the destruction of Israel and the annihilation of Jews everywhere, so what have they got left to threaten?  If Israel had not killed Yassin, Palestinians would definitely have killed more people. So what has Israel got to lose?  This has nothing to do with whether you support Israel, Palestine or neither. The Palestinians have boxed themselves into a corner where any further threats mean nothing.  Leonard Bloksberg, Remuera   And my comment: Indeed.   Young musicians amaze  In a packed Auckland Town Hall we attended the Young Musician of the Year Grand Final. Fourth row from the front, we were surrounded by TV cameras all focused on three amazing young soloists, two violinists and a cellist.  Kate Hawkesby introduced the judges and said that if we, the audience, "lobbied hard enough" then the performances might be shown on TV One. Why should we have to lobby? It was amazing and deserved a direct broadcast.  Why do the arts still take a back seat to sport? Why do we have so much focus on NZ Idol when these musicians have been honing their craft for years?  Even viewers not interested in classical music would have been mesmerized by these performances. My two young students from Papatoetoe Intermediated were.  Dora Whitlock, Remuera    And again I say: Indeed. More on this later.Israel and Palestine  Israel has assassinated Sheikh Ahmed Yassin. Naughty naughty Israel. And bad America. I don't know why, but we better say bad America because they are always bad for some reason. And ohh why not bad Mr Bush too while we are at it. Tut tut tut. Israel; you need to learn to live in peace with your neighbour.  For those who would agree with that last sentence, check  urlLink this .  According to this Herald article:-  " Palestine lost her spiritual father," said Khaled Abdu, one Gazan among an endless stream of mourners. "We lost a great hero and an irreplaceable leader ".   So who was this man? Again the Herald says:-   Yassin joined the Muslim Brotherhood, an Islamic movement dedicated to the spread of Islam, while a student in Egypt. In 1987, he became the spiritual leader of Hamas, the Brotherhood's Palestinian military wing, sworn to Israel's destruction.   In 1991, Yassin was sentenced to life in prison for the kidnapping and killing of two Israeli soldiers.    In the paper version of the Herald today, we read of Yassin:- that he said it would be " acceptable to establish a Palestinian state in the West Bankand Gaza, to be used as a temporary base to destroy Israel. "  This man is seen as a spiritual leader of Islam and of the Palestinians. Well there we have our problem. He is no hero at all. What hero can be leader of an organisation that incites people to encourage their children to be sacrifices in their bloody war against other innocent civilians who happen to live in Israel? This question brings another similar one to mind:- What parent would encourage their son or daughter to kill themselves and others, and be glad when it was done? When will Israel and Palestine be at peace? I suspect never unless Israel is wiped out.Quote  Mark Tasker and I went to Clevedon and had fish and chips for dinner tonight.

So anyway, it should now get a warrant when it's due (next month), and shouldn't (please God) cost me too much money for a while.   The Plan  The plan is to gop hiking in a couple of weeks time. Should be good. Haven't been away for a while. It's the Hunua's, or the Kauranga Valley that's calling, I can't quite make out which at this stage.    Book of the Month  I am half way through Reason to Believe by R.C. Sproul. 'Tis a good book, and a very easy read. Not only that, it's about a 7 on the  'put a the the book a down scale' , where 1 is 'This book is best used as a paper weight on my desk', and 10 is 'This book's cover has been grafted into the skin of my fingers'.Choke Gasp Aaarg   - from Real Issues, Maxim Institute  "Sing-a-long" a mockery   A tax-payer funded "sing-a-long" course raises issues about the accountability and strategic direction in New Zealand's tertiary institutions, as well as providing a good chuckle.   Tairawhiti Polytechnic in Gisborne has reportedly been paid $11 million of tertiary funding to provide a free eight week course to "enhance learning of Maori language". Students once enrolled are given their own waiata songbook and then asked to sing along with songs on the radio from the comfort of their own home.   Who is going to check that students sing? How will we know if they have sung correctly? What will constitute passing the course? No problem. There is no qualification at the end of the course, no external regulation, no record of pass rates and no record of whether people even complete the course.   An estimated one quarter of Gisborne's population was enrolled in the course last year. Minister for Tertiary Education, Steve Maharey has stated that he will act on these kinds of issues as soon as they come to his attention. In light of the projected $115 million "blowout" in funding for community education this year, the end of the "sing-a-long" could be near.Truck Quotes  On the back of trucks there are often quotes. They are often very naff. I saw one today. This is what it said:-  " Treat your child as if they were the person they have the potential to become "  What a load of bosh. What nambi-pambi, wishy-washy, fluffy-brained pure and unadulterated trash. Raaaa.June 27  I will be preaching my first 'in church service' sermon on Sunday the 27th of June.

Matthew and I moved the cave to one corner of the aquarium, and put lush vegetation on the outside of it. He has taken this to be his new home.    Quote of the Week   Like an unchecked cancer, hate corrodes the personality and eats away its vital unity. Hate destroys a man's sense of values and his objectivity. It causes him to describe the beautiful as ugly and the ugly as beautiful, and to confuse the true with the false and the false with the true.  Martin Luther King Jr.C.I.A  I often come back from youth group on saturday nights really upset or down. As leader, you tend to have to deal with things that others might not know, that can just make you really wonder what God is doing. I feel so upset sometimes for the spiritual state of some of the young people. I really hurt inside for them. And it seems that even though I cry out to God for them, that he doesn't answer in the way that would seem best to me. But I am not God, and God knows best. I just wish that not one of them would depart from the path that leads to life, that all would be saved.Alfa  The Alfa is going in for rust repairs next week on Monday. $1222 . Hmmm. I must love my Alfa. It's the only rust on the whole car, and it's in the boot of all places. The rest of the car is sweet as, so I don't know what the deal is with that. I'll keep you informed, as I know you all love the Alfa as much as I do. I suspect this is the last major work that will be needed on it for quite sometime, but that statement in itself could be asking for trouble.   Restoring A Relationship  This is from "A Purpose Driven Life".   1. Talk to God before talking to the person. 2. Always take the initiative. 3. Sympathize with their feelings. 4. Confess your part in the conflict. 5. Attack the problem, not the person. 6. Cooperate as much as possible. 7. Emphasize reconciliation, not resolution.  Good stuff, and stuff I want to use in my life, and suggest others use. I have been aware of many interpersonal conflicts in the church recently, and from now on, I am going to suggest this as a way of sorting things out. Sometimes people don't want to sort things out, but this is an un-Christian attitude. We must always want to restore a relationship.Bad Day  If anyone cares.... I had a bad day at work today, and if I seemed in a bad mood with anyone, it was not directed at them, and I apologise.    News in Brief  I am now clean shaven. Gross. Maybe not for long, as it makes me look a heck of a lot younger.  I am behind on my reading goals. I am too embarrassed to say how far, so don't ask.  Trogdor is currently hiding on top of his cave. Oh nope, now he is patrolling around his cave. And now he is in his cave.Dry Ice  We had some spare dry ice floating round at work the other day. So........... we utilised the opportunity like preschool kids. Here are some cool activities you can try when you come across some:-  1) Stick some down the drain and then put the plug over the top. You get sudden bursts of 'steam' lifting the plug up and down, much like the lid of a pot with boiling water.  2) Stick in a beaker, add water, add detergent. Check out those MASSIVE bubbles.  Well there was plenty more to try, but I won't bore you with all the variations on a theme.    Amazing Grace  Dwaine, Jono and I performed a "NZ idol" attempt at this on Monday night after everyone had left the church. It actually sounded pretty good even though we were mucking around. For your information I was NOT singing, but rather pianoing. We were just going hard, because there was no one to be embarassed in front of. Sometimes when you muck around it sounds better than when you are serious.Bible Verse  Rom 12:2   Don't be like the people of this world, but let God change the way you think. Then you will know how to do everything that is good and pleasing to him.    Probably quite relevant to the discussion of men in leadership. If I'm being to cryptic, do tell me.   People  It's all about people. The Christian life that is. For how can we become more like Christ, develop the fruit of the Spirit, and live for others if we do not demonstrate these things in our relationships.

The defence however was lacking...... at best.Modesty has it's benefits  Check  urlLink this  out.

Chocolate is a flavour, so is Caramel, but Vanilla is labelled as plain. This is a travesty of justice. How dare we do vanilla such a disservice. I demand reparations for the damages done. Vanilla ice cream is not plain ice cream. It's not as if chocolate is vanilla ice cream with chocolate added to it IS IT!? NO! Raa. Vanilla is a flavour in it's own right. And it is my favourite flavour. So don't anyone dare be calling it plain. There is nothing like freshly extruded vanilla ice cream. Mmmm. And by the way. Hokey Pokey ice cream is  not  vanilla flavoured ice cream with bits of junk in it. No. It's hokey pokey flavoured. Raaa and don't you forget it.   Jobs  I am looking at finding another job. I'll keep you posted.   Time for Men to Lead  I am heartened to see young men in our church starting to take things seriously. The lack of male leadership in  the church  today is something I am really concerned about. And by  the church  I mean the church in the Western world.  A side issue is the lack of male leadership in the family. What does please me though is a number of guys I have talked to lately wanting to do something about it, but not only wanting to, they are doing things about it.  Great.BBC  As in  urlLink Berean Bible Church . Well a letter arrived for me containing some of their guff. However I don't know who sent it to me or why. However, I have been told that the NIV is bad, and I shouldn't use it. Don't tell them I occasionally use the Contemporary English Version - they may have a paroxysm. On the other hand the King James Version is God's word without error.   Anyway.. the guys who made up these pamplets which I got sent are really abrasive. Let me give some examples:-  "The Greek text from which the NIV comes was produced by a couple of Mary worshipping Catholics..." "By the way, all you "Russelites" (Jehovah Witnesses to the uninformed)..."  It always worries me when a group sets themselves up as right on something, and everyone else has it wrong. To define a group by what it does not agree with sets off warning bells. Maybe there is something wrong with me, but it worries me.   What does make me laugh though, is that on the sheet I was given, they tell me three things about them that should make me want to visit them. Firstly there is no religion, then there is no tradition of men, but the third just takes the cake. There is no denominationalism. However by saying this they are making themselves a distinct denomination. They are defining their 'group' not so much in terms of who they are with, but who they are not with. Quite ironic.  Pity for them that some things they said were true and good.Interview  I had an interview with ESR on Monday. It seemed to go really well. I should know by the end of the week if I have got the job. Whether I will take it or not depends on may factors. One part of the job is being on call 24/7 one week in four. Yeah.   Boys Breakfast  Ethan, Wee Jono, and Big Jono, and myself went to Mc D's for breakfast this morning. Great time of fellowship, eating, and maths. The maths was working out percentage fat in different meals. Mmmmm!   The Hikoi Hiccup  I promise not to rant and rave. Yes I know I go on. And I know that I can easily offend. So I will be careful....  The organisers of the Hikoi did not think too carefully. Perhaps if they had, they would not have organised the walk across the Harbour Bridge. This has probably cost Auckland into the millions in lost productivity. Not only that it has ticked off many people who may well have otherwise supported the protestors. As I understood, the walk was fairly short, and buses transported the group to a place not far from the bridge. Why could they have not bused across the bridge and carried on from there? Grandstanding perhaps? Well I think (and hope) it has backfired.Another Truck Quote  Saw another interesting back of truck quote.   "Without trucks Australia stops."   Well what are you waiting for! Get rid of the trucks!Worked today... not too bad, I guess. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but then again, now I have so much to look forward to on Monday. Joy. I feel a little better than I did last night when I wrote the last post. Iono... hopefully, I'll just stay in this so-so mood. I'll tell you this, it's a helluva lot better than feeling like you want to shoot yourself dead. HAH. Anyway... I think it's time for either a nap or more Warcraft 3.  =)Finally going to get some rest now... I've been feeling really down lately... mostly 'cause it's the holidays, and frankly, the holidays suck when you don't have someone special to share it with. It's been this way for... what... two years now? Iono  *shrug*  I've been taking it out on my friends... my work... It's just really hard to fake it and pretend you're happy when you're really not. Makes me want to just hop in my car, drive away, and never come back. At least then, I can start with a new slate. The rain isn't helping my melancholy mood any, either. Well... gonna go sleep now... maybe tomorrow will be a better day.  *shrug*Rain, rain, go away... Come again another day...  *sigh*  I hate rain sometimes... I mean, it can be nice, like when you're just chillin' with someone you're into and just listening to the rain fall on the rooftop... BAH. And dood... Jeff still ain't called yet. WTF yo... I'mma go eat now. What a way to spend a perfectly good Friday night.Dum-dee-dum... Well, first off, let me say that taxes hella suck. Robbed me of about three hundred dollars this time around. Goddamn. Secondly, all banks should be closed the Friday and Saturday after Thanksgiving AND it should be opened at least half-day, if not at all, on New Year's Eve. Yup. We're opened until 3:00pm on Christmas Eve, but we gotta work all freaking day on New Year's Eve. That means that I have to get my alkie like hella early or rush to get it that night. Banks suck sometimes. Oh, and thirdly... okay, there is no thirdly. I'm just peeved 'cause of those two things. Work sucks.  Other than that, today was a normal day so far. I woke up around 930am and then got ready for work. Same ol' same ol'. Oh!! By the way, people who call at like 2 in the morning have absolutely NO regard whatsoever for those who are sleeping. It sucks even more when they're aware of the fact that they woke you up, but don't seem to care. I guess that could have been my thirdly...  My friend Jeff is back from Arizona... kinda waiting on his ass to call me to let me know if he's gonna go see a movie with the cookies or not. Hum... and dood... tomorrow, I'm so booked. I've got four people who have asked me to go out with them already and I don't know what to do. Do I squeeze them all in or do I pick one and see if that's fun enough? Aiya... Decisions decisions... Well... time to go play Super Mario Sunshine... or maybe Warcraft 3. Destroying civilizations doesn't seem half-bad right now. MUHAHAHAHA. Aiite, I'm out. Payce.Goodness... well, welcome and enjoy your stay here at  emmie-chan.blogspot.com . I found out about this thing from my younger sister, so I figured I'd give it a try.  Well, where should I start? Hmmm... well, first off, for those who don't know me, I'm just another 22-soon-to-be-23-year old (in January) from Southern California. For those of you who  do  know me, then I suppose that information is pretty redundant, huh?  Okay, okay... blog of the moment: my now famous  Sandwich Theory  (which you can also find in my sister's blogspot: mimosaceae.blogspot.com)   Person A  takes a bite of the sandwich ( aka Person B ).  Person A  decides he/she doesn't like it after a while and then leaves the sandwich to ferment in its own decomposing matter. Along comes  Person C , who saves  Person B  from wasting away into nothingness and takes a bite, as well. Well, after a while,  Person C  decides that enough is enough and he/she didn't like sandwiches to begin with. So  Person C  leaves the unfinished sandwich to ferment once more.  Person A , after having some time to think, decides that, hell, the sandwich wasn't that bad to begin with and comes back to finish it off. BAM.  The Sandwich Theory .  Oh, yeah, final words: Never EVER lend money to ANYONE in excess of twenty dollars. It'll come back to bite you on the ass. Believe me.Oi... rain SUCKS when you're driving...  Well, I was coming home from San Marcos yesterday when it started raining hella hard! My car started to kinda slide around because I KNOW my tires don't grip very well. Anyway. yeah... and I was sleepy... so driving home wasn't fun at all. All I did today was sleep, eat, shower, and watch Back to the Future... and also redid my desktop wallpaper... It doesn't look TOO shabby, considering I'm not a very creative person nor do I know how to utilize fully Adobe Photoshop (which is all I have installed right now on my computer). All I have on it is a picture of the new Z, my ex's MR2, and a R34 Skyline. *DROOL* Okay, I go now. I think I'm hungry, but I'm not sure... HAHA Aiite, I'm out... PaYcE.  o/`  ... won't you take me by the hand, take me somewhere new. i don't know who you are, but i'm with you...  o/`Well... Christmas has come and gone. That's pretty much all I have to say about that. HAH.  Work was slow today. I was short the 30 bucks I was over on Monday. Where the hell did that money go between then and now? Goddamn. Oh, well. There goes my frontline chances. Eh. There's always next quarter. LOL.  I'm listening to Avril right now, thanks to Mimi. Curse her and her music. *yawn* I'm tired, too. Oh, well. I hope tomorrow is slow. I thought I had work at 1:00 but I double-checked my schedule, and apparently, I'm scheduled at 11:00. DOH.  Okay, I'm bored and I'm not in a blogging mood. So, I'mma bizzounce and do something else. PaYcE.  o/`  sorry, girl, but u missed out / well, tough luck, that boy's mine now / we are more than just good friends / this is how the story ends  o/`Happy xmas... and all that other crap.  Well, another day of presents has come and gone... and frankly, it just felt like any other day that i had off, except that every IM i got today was "merry xmas" or something like that. HAH... ah, wells... it's all good. I didn't get much this year, but that's okay. I didn't really want much this year, anyway, except for like maybe a new Z in the garage, some money, and my lobster. But, alas, I didn't get what I really wanted. I did, however, get some cute jammies from Travis, a funny Far Side desk calendar from Mimi, and a gift card to Express from Ben. Yes! Express, here I come!  In other news, I met up with this guy who found me on FAP. That was an interesting experience, considering I dragged Mimi and Steve with me and every place was closed on Christmas Eve. HAHA... the kicker was when this white Accord kept driving around and finally pulled into the parking lot. Supposedly, the guys in the car were starting to come out, so the guy I met up with told me to get in the car. I did as I was told... and then hightailed it outta there. LOL. IONO... guys are confusing. I think right now, all I want is someone to have fun with... nothing serious... I mean, if that happens in the future, I'm pretty sure I won't mind, but I'm not looking for anything committed right now. I think it's because I'm still hella cautious and wary, thanks to my experience with David. I've learned that to wear your heart on your sleeve can be rather devastating in the end, if it happens that things don't work out the way that you want. That's not to say I've become a bitter bitch about it, but I'm definitely more... hesitant. Getting hurt like that can do something to a person. Plus, I'm so damn sarcastic anyway, it only added to my dry humor and cynicism. HAH... I want Travis to come back so I can go back to kicking it at his house and watching Quack Pack at like one in the morning. LOL... now THAT'S the way I like to spend my nights... just chillin' in front of the TV and kickin' back with friends. Or maybe sleeping. But I think I've done WAY too much of that as of late. It's good... but then again, it's bad because I'm starting to get used to it. DOH!!  >.  o/`  i still believe ur eyes ~ there is no choice, i belong to ur life because i live to love u someday ~ u'll be my baby and we'll fly away and i'll fly with u...  o/`*yawn*  man, oh, man. busy busy day today at work. thank goodness i get the next two days off. WOO HOO!!  not much to say. i suppose one of these days, i'll go more in depth as to why i am me, but not now. freaking tired. and hungry. me go eat. must... eat... k, bye bye.Oi...  Been lagging on bloggin' mah shit lately... LOL.  Well, first off, this rain business has GOT to STOP. Secondly, I need to get some serious sleep. And thirdly, I finally got to see LOTR: Two Towers.  Personally, I think that LOTR1 was better than LOTR2. But that's only because I'm more of a drama person than an action person (if I really had to choose, I'd go with comedy all the way, baby).  Heh... no more driving out to LB for a while. That's only 'cause the person/people I know there is/are going back up north for his/their winter break... or at least Christmas, I believe. All good... I don't mind the drive, but one of these days, I'mma end up sleeping on the couch and waking up with a bad back because of it. HAH... nah... the reason why I don't sleep well at other people's houses (or anywhere else, for that matter) is because I've trained myself to sleep well ONLY in my bed. Yup. I'm weird like that.  Speaking of Christmas...  BAH HUMBUG!!!   Nothing else new though... just gonna take it easy now and chill... STILL trying to decide on what to do with my life and shit... and also what to do with that errant ex-boyfriend of mine. Dilemma upon dilemma. Goddamn...  Oh, and WHERE'S MY LOBSTER?! Aiite, I'm out. PaYcE.  =P  o/`  it's christmas time, again. it's time to be nice to the people you can't stand all year. i'm growing tired of all this christmas cheer...  o/`Another rainy rainy day...  Man, I'm tired. I had hella sleep, too... =P  That's probably why... But, yeah, called the ex today to see what's been up with him. Tried to pull a typical girl thing and guilt-trip his ass, but I was too tired, so my attempt was only half-hearted. Apparently, he has a REAL job, thank goodness. I would have laughed at him if he had been stuck with a mall job. Now, don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with a mall job, but when you go from making about 18 bucks an hour down to like minimum wage, that's pretty sad. Although, if you're strapped for cash, then I guess I wouldn't say anything, but his unemployment was his own doing. Basically, I think that he came in to work one day, decided that he didn't want to work anymore, and then quit. He didn't think about the consequences of his actions. PFFF. If *I* had quit, I would have had AT LEAST two other options waiting for me. *rolleyes* Some idiots never learn.  I think that's going to be the rant of the moment. Hmm... I wonder if tonight's Smallville episode is going to be a rerun. I hope not. I'm tired of watching reruns. And last week's Friends episode kinda sucked. It was funny in some parts, but it pretty much sucked overall. RATING: 5.5  I need more money in my account... or I need to learn to not spend my money like my brother. Homeboy has an average of like 1200 bucks every month. WTF. I'm lucky if I have 200 bucks at the time I get paid again. DOH. I have to call the dentist back and see if I can even keep my appointment. MAAAAAAN. I hate this whole switching insurance business. One should NOT have to go through this AT ALL. It's such an inconvenience. Curse me and my not going to school.  Okay, time to go shower and clean up. Don't know why... it's not like I'm going anywhere. =P PaYcE.  o/`  look at the skies, tell me, what do you see? just close your eyes and describe it to me...  o/`I just wanted to add that I was reading my sister's blog and WTF... who the hell is this "Thunder" character she keeps referring to? It reminds me of Thumper in Bambi. HAH. Aiite... I'm out... PaYcE.La La La...  Fock. I'm BORED. I'm tired of sitting here and listening to my music... I can now sing one of Faith Hill's songs almost perfectly, inflections and all. Country music ain't that bad, I guess... but only some of it. The other stuff is like crap because it's all so hokey. Returned my stuff today... NO MORE SHOPPING!! DAMMIT!! I can't afford any more clothes... PLUS, I refuse to deal with that mall parking lot BS. My GOD... I drove around for like HOURS today trying to find parking. HAH. Okay, I lied. Maybe like five minutes, but it was worth it. I got hella good parking... like two away from the handicap parking right in front of the mall entrance. WOO HOO.  I went on my job interview today... EH... I think I did okay, considering it wasn't really my best effort. I also went to get my eyes checked and stuff... YAY. I can see again. What else did I do? Eh... Forgot. Oh, and I got paid today. YES! I got me some mula in my empty Coach purse. LOL.  God, I'm so tired right now... My mind is starting to ramble in its thinking. I think I'll end here... maybe even go to sleep early... hehe... I got work at 830 tomorrow morning. My manager had better bring us bagels because I'm not getting my usual Burger King breakfast. If I don't get food, I'mma be one cranky ass bitch tomorrow. Tee hee.  Oh, and I'm going to start ending my blogs with random lines from songs. Pick the right song and you get a special prize. *wink* MUHAHAHA  >=)  o/`  to know that you feel the same as I do is a three-fold utopian dream...  o/`Finally got my money...  But of course, I gotta wait still... *sigh* I think my boss is right. There's something about David that makes me forget that I'm pissed off at him. I just think about his unemployed situation and just feel mad sorry for him. *sigh* again. It's not that I'm in love with him... I don't think I am anymore. I mean, I love him, but I'm not *in love* with him, ya know? I'll always want to help him HAH even though he doesn't deserve it one bit. *rolleyes* Oh, well.  I have my job interview tomorrow and I'm kinda nervous about it... haven't had one in over two years, so I'm a lil rusty... which, I suppose is a GOOD thing, right? LOL. Tomorrow isn't going to be a terribly busy day for me... just the interview and then I have to return some stuff at the mall. Then, I'mma go see the eye doctor and get freaking new contacts. These old things that I'm wearing just aren't cutting it anymore. And then I also have to go to the doctor's and pick up some stuff. No, not medication. I'm no pill-popper. =P  I just need some verification of some tests and stuff. Blah blah blah.  I'm listening to my music... haha... it's actually music that my friend had me download and then burn onto a CD. Well, make that TWO CD's. It's all good, though... some of it is stuff I don't have and that I should have downloaded a while ago. Got some country now WOO HOO... I am officially diversified. Well, kinda. I don't have any kind of Christian music or metal... or crap like that. HAH.  And so, I end on this note: o/`  you're a fine piece of real estate and I'm gonna get me some land...  o/`Ever get that feeling that any minute now, you're gonna go crazy and have a MAJOR panic attack?  Yeah, that's how I'm feeling right now.  This is getting ridiculous. I need my money and I'm beginning to feel that the only to get my money is to go through darker and more devious routes. I really don't want to do that, but David is giving me no choice whatsoever. Let's just hope he gets his head out of his ass soon and sees the light and that to mess with me isn't that great of an idea.  I think that's it for now. I have a headache again. Maybe I have to go eat... and then take some Advil or something.Oi... I have to look at my MBA information still... kinda procrastinating on that. I also have to fill out an application for this job interview I have on Friday at 9am. Aiya! Kinda just tired all around... It's like my heart is tired. Not like physically tired, 'cause I'm pretty sure I'm still healthy, but like emotionally tired. This drama I'm having with my ex is kinda taking it's toll on me.  Nothing much right now, just kinda chilling... Gotta go eat some dinner soon though... I wonder where my dad is.  =P  I have to talk to him about some stuff. Okay, me go now.OMFG...  My ex is THIS close to completely pissing me off and making me go postal on his ass. Good lord... what's a girl gotta do to get her money from a bitch-whooped moron? I mean, honestly, most people don't understand why I've gone this long without doing too much about his HUGE debt to me... I mean, I get my payments... and it's not like I put any of my own money toward the card that the debt is on... But enough is enough. I don't like the fact that I have to hunt him down just to get a measly 150-200 bucks. AND I don't like that he's trying to make me work around MY work schedule in order to get my money, whereas HE is currently unemployed. Our conversation today? It went something like this:  Ass:  Yeah, um, I'm pretty busy Fridays. Me:  Why? What do you have to do? Ass:  Um, stuff. Me:  Like what? Ass:  Just stuff I have to do. Me:  It's not like you're working... and you can't find time during the DAY to fit me in? Ass:  Nope.  Uh... I might be wrong, but why is it that he needs to wait until Friday in order to run his errands when ALL he does during his SECOND unemployment stint since I've known him is go out and spend his dumb bitch's money? And it's not like I'm not trying to be unaccommodating. But, I'm sorry... THIS working girl actually has to work during the week. I only get Fridays off usually because it's the easiest day to give me. It's not like I request it all the damn time. If anything, HE should be working with MY schedule. You know, he ALWAYS did this when we were together. It was either his way or the highway. I swear, the more I think about it, the more I want to... well, let's just say that I want to cause him IMMENSE bodily harm. However, that does me no world of good because then I get no money.  Thank God I know a notary that can notarize what he owes me in writing... which means that I'm pretty close to going down that route, as much as I don't really want to. But frankly, the issue of trust between me and my ex went down the crapper the day that he broke up with me and then four months later hooked up with the first bitch that wanted to sleep with him.  Yeah, I know I sound bitter, but it's just frustrating. I mean, if I knew what I know now BACK THEN, shit, I woulda said "buh bye" and left his ass on the curb to rot a long time ago.  Other than that, today was a decent day. Got my tortilla chicken soup from Islands and I also went to Target and got some face cleaning stuff. I hate having combination/oily skin. It's so hard to keep it from getting all gross and stuff... If I could, I'd wash my face every two hours at work just so I can get that clean feeling again... I also have to ask my dad about an e-mail that I was supposed to have gotten from this company I have an interview with on Friday... better do that today. Oh... and look at my MBA program information again. DOH. More school... Oh, well. As long as I become rich and powerful and can crush all those little morons that gave me grief in my life, it'll be worth it.  =)  K, time to finish my soup. Ta ta!Wow... More shopping. Well, actually, today, I didn't shop for me. I was trying finish Christmas shopping for everyone. I finished my sister's present... and got my brother his gift. I had a helluva time trying to pick something for my dad, but then finally realized that the man has everything that he needs... so I'm stumped right there. All in all, a slightly productive day.  Was supposed to have lunch with the ex today, but homeboy lagged and decided to wake up late and then go see his PO... *sigh* sometimes, I feel that it's not worth keeping him around in my life. I like his company and would love to keep his friendship, but I just don't feel like he's putting the amount of effort that he should. Yes, I know he has a girlfriend, but shit, you can still try, ya know?  Man... I keep getting like spam IM's from people. I wonder how they're getting my SN. It's getting QUITE annoying. Oh, wells...  Well, gotta go hit the hay now... I'm hella tired... and I'm not sure if I'mma be going out tomorrow night. Heh... We'll see.  =P*yawn*  well... not much new today either... just work... was out of balance today dammit... >=P  k, gonna go get ready for bed and then play some video games. oh, and do some sit-ups too. speaking of which, i really ought to start working out again... maybe tomorrow.  =)  kekekeSigh... Got Lilo and Stitch today on DVD. Woo hoo! haha... And I also got a HUGE Grumpy doll... AND another Stitch doll... =)  Work was, as usual, freaking busy... and tomorrow is gonna be killer, too... but here's hoping that it isnt  *crossing fingers*  Okay, I go sleep now.Jesus... Today was one of the BUSIEST muthafuckin' days I've ever worked. Good God... it's like everyone and their freaking MOM decided to go to the bank today. Shit... worked 930-730... and had an hour lunch somewhere inbetween. No other breaks, otherwise. Have I mentioned I hate the holidays? This is one of those reasons. Thank goodness I didn't get the bitchy customers who whined about holds on their accounts. Haha... in the mood that I was in, I would have been like: "Yeah, there's a hold on your account and sorry, I can't release it because you've overdrawn your account one too many times in the past six months." Oi...  But on a brighter note, I get to pick up my Lilo and Stitch DVD tomorrow! Woo hoo!! Trying to see if there's any way possible to spend 50 bucks there in order to get my free 16" plush Stitch. My GOD, Stitch is SO cute!! WAAAAAAAAAI!!!  Hum... I guess that's it. I'mma prolly hit the hay pretty soon... freaking tired and want to sleep away this busy busy BUSY day. Well, maybe. I might also stay up and burn myself a new CD to listen to. I'm sick of the ones that I have in my car.  =POMG... imagine ~ you step into a mall and then proceed to buy over $400 of merchandise... and this isn't even your christmas shopping, either! Yup. You got it. I spent over four bills on junk. LOL. Actually, about half of it was clothes for work, but I'm gonna be returning some of it. And then there's Coach. My God, that store is going to be the end of me. I bought a slimmer wallet to fit in the demi purse, but it didn't fit like I wanted it to, so I'm going to return that too. That thing was like $130 bucks with tax. Aiya... So yeah... I think today was very productive, shopping-wise. But then again, I went with my ex-boyfriend, so it wasn't really all that. I'd forgotten that he's a pain in the ass to take to the mall.  =P  I suppose that I could put something funny once in a while in this blog thing, but not too many funny things happen to me. If stuff happens, it could actually be construed as "drama". Oh, joy. But if I ever come across something funny, then I'll be sure to put it in here.  =)  Aiite. Gotta go get something to eat and then try to play more video games. Hah. The life of a college graduate. Work work work during the week and then straight bummin' it during the weekend. LOL. Life is... okay... for now. Aiite, laters!oooi... my thanksgiving weekend was a total bust. well, kinda. ended up going out with my friend jeff and his friends for a drink or two at tgif's, but everyone had to leave early 'cause they all had to pack to go back home. ah, well... at least, i got out, yah? still puzzling over what to do regarding my ex and his current situation, but that makes my head hurt, so i'm trying not think about it too much. right now, i'm lagging on getting ready to go shopping... aiya. i'm dreading going to the mall right now. all those people... OI. but it's coo... at least i'mma go shopping! woo hoo!!  =)  k me outties bbye!OMG... I am THE most uncoordinated girl in the WORLD!!  Okay, so today, Steve and I went to LA Fitness to work out and to check out this Hip Hop class that they had. OMFG... those moves were like... impossible for me to comprehend. I think I only got the shaking the ass part down. So I hightailed it outta there after like 10 minutes. I was like "fuq shit... I'm outta here". But other than that, I worked out my arms and a little of my back and did my usual cardio. Not too bad, especially since the computers were down at work today thanks to that virus that's floating around out there in la la land.  *SHRUG*  Oh, well. I got my money, so who cares if everyone else didn't?  LOL. Goddamn, I'm so mean sometimes. Oh, FOCK. I was supposed to be nice for a week, huh? Okay, I start again tomorrow kekeke...  And in other news, talked to the ex... He's been exceptionally nicer to me, for some reason... maybe it's because I don't bitch at him as much anymore. I'm tired of doing that... it's always the same ol' same ol'... besides, I guess I can be nice to him from now on. Well, until he pisses me off again  LOL... Oh, goodness... I'm a weirdo. I have to call tomorrow to make an appointment to cut my hair, so yeah... woo hoo. Not too much going on today, except the work thing and the gym thing... I think I'mma head out again tomorrow to work out. WOO HOO... I have semi-motivation right now... *YAWN*  Aiite... well, time for this princess to get her beauty sleep. Adios amigos and all that other crap. PaYcE.  o/`  i'm lying alone, with my head on the phone, thinking of you till it hurts...  o/`I think this weekend is one of those weekends where I really could done a lot of my errands and chores and such, but chose not to because the overwhelming desire to fall on my bed and sleep the hours away was far too great.  THINGS I HAVE YET TO DO: *  go to IKEA and find me a chest/drawer that will fit all my bags/purses and yet still serve as a nightstand *  rearrange all my shit when I get above mentioned item because my room is starting to annoy me *  get my hair trimmed again... I think next month is going to be hair dye month *  get a new picture going on the net... my current one is still accurate, but frankly, I'm sick of it *  lose some freaking weight... godDAMN it's hard to lose just a few pounds... maybe I just have to eat less KEKE *  find me a date for Valentine's Day... FOCK... CURSE those people who've reminded me that day is coming up... *  find me a date PERIOD... LOL *  find me a booty call...? MUHAHAHA... nah, I ain't that kinda girl *  sit down and seriously write my troubles away (I write fiction... it's my "anti-drug")  Well... I sit here and I read my brother and sister's blogspots and I'm like WTF... They actually talk about what goes on in their lives. LOL. And here I am, just wasting my time away sitting in front of my computer saying the same ol' shit over and over again. So, aiite... I'll follow their lead and talk about what's going in MY life... or maybe not. I think I'll just use today's blog to vent away, as usual... because as you know what they say: it's better to talk about your problems than to keep them bottled up inside. I'm not sure exactly who "they" are, so *SHRUG* here goes nothing...  RANT #1: Why is it that everyone seems to say that I'm "such a nice person" or that I have such a "great personality"? And then they go on to ask why is it that I don't have a boyfriend. Don't you think that if I knew why I didn't have a boyfriend, that I would go out and do things that would LET me get a boyfriend? Hmmm... I wonder if that made any sense whatsoever. Oh, well... I don't give a rat's ass. Hmmm... Maybe that's the reason why I havent lured someone into my trap yet, huh?  *ROLLEYES*  Perhaps my oh-so-great personality is my downfall. I think that I have the propensity to be the sweetest person on the face of this damn planet, but you know what? That's just too much work. Yes, I can be sweet... and I can be nice... and I can be caring as the next girl, but deep down, I have a realistic point of view about things that happen and usually that means that the sarcastic and biting side of me emerges... and usually stays there for a long ass time. ARRRRGH. I think I'mma try to be nice for the next week and see where that gets me. Yes, a WEEK. I'm human. I need to start small and work my way up.  RANT #2: Where the hell have all my so-called friends gone? It pisses me off that my so-called best friend has decided to cut off all communications to all her old friends once her ass moved outta her house. I mean, c'mon, that's absolutely ridiculous. And then there's the idiot in Arizona. Don't get me wrong... he's a good guy... I THINK I can count on him for almost anything, but lately, he's been getting on my nerves... He seems to think that he knows what's best for me (along with the rest of this goddamn world) and is always telling me things will get better BLAH BLAH BLAH. Bullshit. He's over there. He knows NOTHING of what is happening HERE. And then the Irvine people... my God... how little I see of them now that I don't go to school there anymore. SIGH. My life sucks. Goddamn it.  Looking up, I see that I'm a very angry and moody person. I really ought to change that, I think. Maybe when I get paid and I can get some shopping in... Then maybe I'll be a little lighter in my mood, yeah? Or maybe if I found myself a guy. Yeeeeeeah... That would TOTALLY do it.  As my brother would say: FUQ SHIT. I'mma go do some writing now. Lates.  o/`  kaze ga yoseta kotoba ni... oyoida kokoro... kumo ga hakobu ashita ni... hazunde koe...  o/`Man... is it blog-time again? Well, not much to say except that my birthday came and went peacefully. That's right, folks. I'm now 23. Good lord, that's old. AIYA. Okay, well, I'm going to sleep now. Bye bye.ARRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!  Fock. I'm so freaking bored. I need a boyfriend or something. Shit... I'm tired of just sitting around doing absolutely NOTHING. Maybe I'll take up bird watching. Yeah... can you imagine it now? Me... nature... and bird poop. No, that's okay. But yeah... I'm definitely sick of waiting around for someone to come around. Where the hell do people meet other people? God, they make it so easy in the movies, ya know? But shoo... in real life, it's a freaking pain in the freaking ass. Or maybe I just don't try hard enough? IONO. I'm sorry I don't have import model looks or the perfect body, but *sniffle*...  Eh, fuck it. I don't give a flying rat's ass what people think of me. I am who I am and nothing's gonna change it. HAH... for all you people out there who's still interested in talking to me, then go right on ahead. But be warned: I'm easily irritated and I don't put up with bullshit, so choose your words wisely.  Thank God Big Bear's only two days away. Which reminds me, I've still gotta pack. I sure ain't hell got time tomorrow. I'mma be working all day and then I'mma be in Irvine for the rest of the night. Woo hoo!! Karaoke, baby!  Aiite, I'm out. PaYcE.  o/`  i never thought i'd die alone...i laughed the loudest, who'd have known... o/`*STRETCH*  *YAWN*  *SNORE*  Oi... I wish it was that easy. Oh, wait. It is. HAH.  Hum... well, it's been like a week since I've blogged, but not to worry. Not a damn thing happened in that entire time. I think.   Let's recap, shall we?   Sunday :  I went to my friends' place in Irvine and chilled. Then I went to Newport Beach and chilled. That night, the winds started.  Monday :  I went to work. The winds kept me up for a long time and kept waking me up once I went to sleep. I was very cranky that day at work and I snapped at just about anyone who happened to be unfortunate enough to irritate me that day.  Tuesday :  I went to work, went home, and then... stayed there. Wednesday:  See Tuesday. Well, I worked out first. Then I went home and stayed there.  Thursday :  I went to work, then went shopping, then went home, where I slept for 2 hours. I then woke up and went down to Irvine and kicked it with my friends. DDR is crazy now. How the hell are people supposed to move like that?  Friday :  I went to work, then shopping AGAIN, then went home. After wasting time online for a while, I went down to Irvine and chilled there until 1130pm, at which point left because everyone wanted to go clubbing at The Shark Club. LOL. What a waste of money.  Which brings us to today. And surprise, surprise. Here I am, sitting once again in front of my computer, doing absolutely nothing.  *YAWN*  Fock this. I'm sleeping. Aiite, I'm out. PaYcE.  o/`  come, stop your crying, it will be all right... just take my hand ~ hold it tight, now...  o/`Hmm... sitting at home on a Saturday night. BORING!  Man... usually, I got like plans A, B, and C during the weekends because, you know, things fall through all the time. And, dude, like today totally was an example of that. And now look at me. Sitting at home. And there was kinda a plan D and E, but D was still in LA at the time and I didn't know how to kill two hours until he was done, so I drove home. I'm talking to E right now, but it's too late. I already cleaned off all my make-up and I'm in my jammies already. That's not to say that I really can't go out, but it's a lot of work and I'm really tired aaaaand... plan E just called, but shoo... I ain't going out no more. Dammit. I think I'mma watch Ice Age for like the gazillionth time. Hehe... that movie is hella funny... I think I might like it more than Lilo and Stitch. *GASP* Like OMFG!!  Speaking of movies... I want Zoolander on DVD. It's the only movie with Ben Stiller that I actually enjoyed. "Blue Steel" hehehe  Me sleepy now. I think I'm going to get off my computer for a little bit. Okay, bye bye.ARGH...  How I HATE it when people call me at like 8 in the morning... Well, I'm not sure if it was or not, but it sure seemed early to me. I don't even remember what my friend told me. All I remember is him telling me "my flight is blah blah blah". 1455? Aiya. I guess I'll check the flight schedule before I leave for the airport today. I also have to stop by my friend's work and give her an iced vanilla latte because I said I would. Me and my big mouth. Oi. And now, I think my cough is coming back. Foooooock man. I thought I had gotten rid of that thing already. Took me long enough, too. Freaking TWO months plus.  I'm tired... so very tired.  Ugh. Gotta go get ready now. Woo hoo. Aiite, lates.  o/`  i watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night shining with the light from the sun...  o/`*YAWN*  GodDAMN my fingers are numb right now. Oi. You would think that after finding out what alcohol can do to you, that you would stop, but no. I like to drink... and here we go again. Can't feel the tips of my fingers. Heh. Thas right, people. I get numb fingers. I don't get hangovers. I don't turn bright red. I just get numb.  Anyway, I feel crappy right now because I'm tired. I'm gonna go now.  Oh, yeah, and happy new year, people... and all that other crap. Lates.Can you believe that it's almost March 2003?  Yeah, that's right... MARCH. Dood... where the heck did all the time go? It seems that yet another year is slipping through my fingers as I sit here idle and not doing a damn thing. Or rather, it feels like I'm not doing anything. I mean... I'm 23... still working at the bank  >.  Yep. You heard me. PAH-TOO-TEE. LOL.  Oh, snap... I think I just went deep on y'all. HAH. I don't know what to say, really. I can't blog like long ass blogs. It's not in my nature to dwell on things. Okay, I lied there. I'm the type to analyze anything and everything that I do because for every action, there is a reaction. And with my luck, the reactions are all gonna be hella bad. Oi. But I don't really write down the stuff that REALLY bothers me. Like... emotional, personal shit, ya know? It's just not me to do that. I keep things all bottled up inside and then let it blow when the bottle gets too full. HAHA. Oops. Oh, well.  Aiite, well, enough serious blogging for the day. On to more amusing things.  The cops in Huntington Beach caught a chick who was wanted for customer impersonation that had come to my branch. Had my supervisor told me to stall, I woulda stalled like there was no tomorrow. Unfortunately, she was slow... or rather, I was just being a little clueless and let the chick get away. *shrug* Oh, well. Anyway, yeah, she was caught. HAH. Crime doesn't pay at ALL!  What a hard day's work. At least I get paid Friday. WOO HOO. And I heard from a little birdie that I'mma be getting a raise at my next performance review. Wassup!!  Me outties now. PaYcE.  o/`  last night, i had a dream about you... in this dream, i'm dancing right beside you...  o/`and a week later...  here i am blogging! LOL. i've been majorly lagging on this... but probably because there's really nothing to say, ya know? it's still the same ol' same ol'. i work, i go home, i take care of the house while my parents are gone. at least they're back tomorrow, thank goodness. i don't think i like the whole "empty refrigerator" situation. well, actually, right now, there's leftovers because me and my brother bought some kfc last night. LOL. aiite well, i'm outties cuz i ain't got nuttin else to say. bye bye!*YAWN*  I need sleep. LOTS of sleep.  Valentine's Day SUCKS BALLS big time... but that's just because I'm single. LOL. Me and a friend went to dinner at Olive Garden, which was cool... except for the hour plus wait just to get a table. I was like WTF... but then said eff this... I'll wait. After we ate, we made our way to the Block and watched Daredevil. It was an okay movie. I already knew what was going to happen, so I was just watching the movie to see if it followed the actual comic book closely or not. I would normally say if it did, but I really don't remember too much. LOL. Anyway, time to eat then sleep. Bye bye!Man, oh, man.  Today was exceptionally boring. Well, it started out that way at first. I had three hours of sleep, but that's okay... and then I worked from 830-130 (but I got out around 145). When I got home, I realized that there truly is no food left in my house except for a frozen pizza and vegetables. Aiya. Anyway, I rummaged and found some more leftovers and I ate. Then I slept. For three hours. :D Sleep is good! I woke up around 8 or so and went downstairs to watch TV, which was aiite... but then Law and Order: SVU came on. That, my friends, is a good show. I like watching it from time to time (when I'm actually home on a Saturday). It was about 1000 when my sister and her friends came to the house and we were chilling. I was once again amazed at what a small world we live in. Sometimes people from your past reemerge and you're like, "DAMN... it's YOU!!" It was cool, though, and lots of reminiscing was done. LOL. I didn't get drunk, like I wanted... BUT there is a bottle of Smirnoff Green Apple Twist sitting in my kitchen. HAHAHAHA. My alkie for the week. Okay, well, it's getting late... and I'm cold, and my bed looks hella inviting right now. Have a good one. PaYcE.  o/`  words can't express what i confess with each beat of my heart...  o/`Today... was not very productive.  Well, it wasn't as productive as I had wanted it to be.  With my parents gone, I've got the house... and I've got to be responsible.  Of course, I forgot that today was street sweeping day, but luckily, my brother was parked in the street and he left the house at around 545am.  Hmm... I wonder why that foo had to leave so early... even if he *did* have to open the store where he works.  *shrug*  Well, I'll get a story out of him later.  Goodness... I feel like such a mother right now.  Always trying to make sure my brother and sister have food to eat, make sure the house is clean blah blah blah... I was supposed to do laundry, but I think I'll do it either tomorrow or Friday after I get home from work.  It doesn't really matter... I just need to make sure my polo is clean in time for Saturday.  No way I'mma wear that without getting it washed.  Only bad thing is that it's starting to fade.  Damn those dark colors... Well, that and my forgetting to turn the shirt inside out when I toss it into the laundry basket.  I finally washed my car after months of letting dirt layer on it.  OMG... I'd forgotten what clean silver looks like.  LOL... I was getting used to the dirty silver color.  I was going to wash the RAV-4, but I decided to wait until Friday because I got tired after washing my car.  I didn't even vacuum it like I wanted to.  It's getting kinda dirty in there.  GRRR... but at least it's clean.  AND... on a bright note, the new car wash I bought doesn't streak my windows.  :D  Usually, I have to clean them again after I wash the car because of the icky streaks.  But then again, maybe it's because it's winter and the water didn't dry as fast.  *shrug*  Oh, well.  At least my car is clean.  Hmmm... I looked outside and saw clouds.  WTF... is it supposed to rain?  'Cause if it does, I'm taking the RAV-4 to work.  Ain't no way I'mma waste two hours worth of washing and drying and cleaning the car just to get it dirty again.  Even my rims are silver again.  They were getting pretty bad, let me tell you that.  I have to work a full shift for the next two days... let's see if I get cranky or not (I probably will).  Tomorrow, I'm big boss on my side of the branch 'cause my supervisor has the day off.  WOO HOO... BIG BOSS EMMIE-CHAN!!  MUHAHAHA!!!  I think I'mma prolly work out tonight with my sister and Steve 'cause I haven't gone in a week.  AIYA... there goes the routine I had gotten myself into.  Speaking of working out, I think I'mma do some free weights and work out my arms because there isn't anything else to do.  Y'all have a good one.  PaYcE.  o/`  do you ever question your life... do you ever wonder why...  o/`Have you ever felt like your life is like this old, old record? I'm talking like the same song plays over and over again and there's no way to stop it because the record player is broken? Yeah, I'm kinda starting to feel like that right now. Don't get me wrong... I'm not depressed or anything. I think I'm just bored. I never thought life would be this boring once school ended. I try to do different things... when I have time for them. I work most of the week. I usually get a day off, which is cool, but hardly enough to do anything I truly want to do. I don't have enough vacation time right now to go somewhere different. Most likely, I'm going to have to wait until the latter part of the year to go do something different, like I did last year when I went to Florida. That was fun, albeit it was freaking HOT. You know how the sun just beats down on you during the summer time here? Well, push it to October and add some humidity and that's Florida. But I had fun, regardless. My friend wants me to go up north in July, but I dunno... I hate going anywhere by myself. Well, we'll see... I'm working on some things right now, so maybe I'll be able to go *somewhere* sooner. I'mma go to the mall soon so I can return my Coach wristlet. Damn thing is too big for my purse. Plus, I don't like putting all my stuff like into the thing. It's cute, but impractical. I'mma prolly buy some more clothes at Express because... I feel like it. I just need new clothes. I also need to start working out. It's hard to motivate yourself once you've stopped. But I'm paying for it still so I'd better go. I'll go tomorrow for sure. I was going to go today, but I was hella tired at 11am. Life is boring. I need some spice to liven things up. I think I'mma go lookin' for spice today. LOL. Aiite then, I'm out. PaYcE.  o/`  no way november will see our good-bye, when it comes to december, it's obvious why no one wants to be alone at christmas-time...  o/`It's 12:37am right now and I'm blogging. Aiya... What a weekend. It started off on Thursday night, when I went to go chill with my friends down in Irvine. We went to Chili's to go eat and I had the Margarita Presidente, which was okay... and I have the shaker, too... Which reminds me ~ that thing is still in my car. Anyway, Friday was party night in Irvine... I came home around 1am and slept until 6 something, then had to wake up and go to work. THEN... I came home and chilled for like an hour before taking off for Irvine again because we were all supposed to get ready for this formal thing Saturday night. Oi... What a night. We took off around 12am then went to The Boat in Rowland Heights for a late night meal... didn't get back to Irvine until 2:30am. I washed SOME of the pomade that my friends had used when they styled my hair and then chilled there until 5:30... I came home at 6:00... and slept until 330pm. And now, I can't sleep because I'm waiting for a call... Well, scratch that. I can sleep. Shit... all I have to do is answer the phone when it rings... which is what I believe I will do. Aiite then, I'm out. PaYcE.  o/`  swing swing swing from the tangles of my heart is crushed by a former love...  o/`Man. Do I have a sticker that says "IDIOTS PLEASE APPLY HERE" on my forehead or something?  That's all I really have to say at the moment. Aiite. PaYcE.I think that I'm bored with my life again... then, again, when has that ever changed.  That's not to say that I'm unhappy with life... just... kinda reached a plateau as to where I should going.  I work to pay my bills... and I enjoy what I do, surprisingly enough.  I never really considered staying in banking ~ I've always thought that I'd be stuck at some desk job, working 9-5, and then going home at the end of the day.  Well, actually, that's what I do now, except, I don't get a desk to sit at.  Hell, I don't even get to sit at all.  I kinda miss being 18 again.  Life was so simple back then... and I had the potential to really DO something with my life and my future.  I mean, I still do, right now, but it seems that as you get older, it gets harder to change your routine... as they say, it's hard to teach an old dog new tricks.  Aw... but I ain't old... although I'm two years away from being 25, which is a quarter of a century old.  Damn, I'm such a pessimist.  LOL.  I think that I really need to take some time... a vacation perhaps... and really think about my future.  After all, sitting around and bullshitting all day isn't going to get me anywhere, right? Right.  Now, about that vacation... LOL... where, oh, where shall I go... and am I going to be driving?  PaYcE.Sometimes, it kinda sucks when you don't make solid plans ahead of time... and it kinda sucks when you say you'll do something when, in fact, you don't want to. That kinda happened this weekend to me. On Friday, I was supposed to go help out my friends @ UCI set up and practice their run-through for the annual VSA Culture Night show. I was all set to do it when my friend in Long Beach called and said there was going to be a get-together around 10 @ his place. At this point, it wasn't too bad, since I figured I'd chill and help out till 1030 or so in Irvine and then take off. Then comes my other friend, who called and asked if I wanted to go out with her and her friend that night. Now, normally, I don't like overlapping things, but this night was an exception. So I thought long and hard and decided to go out with my friend and then go to Long Beach. It turned out to be a good thing.  :)  Then comes Saturday. Final dress rehearsal for the show and I was definitely supposed to help, which is why I took yesterday off to begin with... and suffered through 5 days straight of work, which I'm not really used to. Anyway, I didn't really want to go, since I came home @ 2am that morning and I wanted to sleep. Plus, my dad went to get my tires rotated and everything, so I didn't have a car. Anyway, I called up my friend in Long Beach because he said that he was going to go see the show that night, so I arranged to go with him... thus electing to cancel on my friend, with whom I had sorta told (well, she had decided for me) that I would go to a club. So when she called, I told her I didn't want to go clubbing, but if it had been a bar, I would have totally gone. And she tells me they *are* going to a bar. I was like "CRAP", but I held my ground and said I didn't want to go anymore. I think she's mad at me because I cancelled, but I truly didn't want to go to ANY gay clubs or bars. So I ended up kickin' it in Long Beach because apparently, my friends there didn't want to pay to watch the show (I didn't either) so we ate dinner and rented/bought movies and watched "Drumline" and "About a Boy".  And that, my friends, brings us to today. I'm going to finish watching "Two Can Play that Game" and then shower and then run my errands... maybe do a little shopping. HAHA. Aiite then... PAYCE.Got my Jamba Juice. Got my new books. Time to truly enjoy a nice Sunday afternoon. PaYcE.So, okay... weekly recap of my oh-so-exciting life:  Monday : worked   Tuesday : worked   Wednesday : worked... then saw Matrix: Reloaded @ 10:30pm with my friends   Thursday : DAY OFF ~ went to the bank to deposit money into my account so I could pay my bills, went to Jamba Juice because for some reason I can't live without it now, went to Irvine and kicked at my friends' pad   Friday : worked... went to Yardhouse @ the Spectrum in Irvine with a couple of friends to chill   Saturday : worked, then went bowling @ Irvine Lanes for this Bowlathon thing that my work is putting on, then went home and slept all freaking day   Sunday  (today): haven't done a damn thing yet except manage to give myself a headache by sleeping too much and sitting in front of the computer perusing Internet websites... AIYA!  I think I'mma go get ready now and go get myself some Jamba Juice. I also have to stop by Target and get some more enzymatic (sp? too lazy to go look at the box) cleaning tablets for my contacts... speaking of which... I will not be wearing them today. I am too damn lazy to go poking my eyes today. Maybe I'll stop by Barnes and Nobles and see if they have any new books I would care to read. My copy of THE GODFATHER is getting a little worn around the edges. I think I've read that book about ten times now... and each time, it's just as good as the previous. All right then... I'm out. PaYcE.HAHA...  Time for my monthly blog.  =)  Not much new news to say, other than that I've been reminded once more that guys are jerks and complicated.  But then, what else is new, eh?  LOL.  But on a brighter and less serious note, I got my hair dyed yesterday.  =)  It's a mix of mahogany (which has a red base) and black sherry (which has a red-violet base) with red highlights.  Yeah... trying to do a little something different this time around.  I WAS going to put in blonde streaks, too, but I thought that that might be too much for the people at the bank to handle, so I figured bright red will have to do.  LOL.  I wonder how long THIS will last.  Hopefully my Color VIVE will help my color last longer.  X2:  X-Men United was also pretty good.  MUCH better than the first, in my opinion.  Ah, well.  Okay, so, yeah, that's it for this month's blog.  If I happen to find me a boy toy to play with before next month rolls around, you'll be seeing another blog from me.  *wink*wink*  PaYcE.Hi hi hi...  This weekend was so... lame. HAHA. I can't stand it when people lag... but then again most of the time it's not their fault. Like yesterday: I was supposed to go see a movie with Travis, but his ass got out all late from work because he had to move a bunch of cars to get this one car that the customer specifically asked for. What a crock. So I take off from my house around 10pm and drive out to Long Beach, which is whatevers. He doesn't really live that far away. So he gets off work and then we go to the movie theater around 1045. Surprisingly, they're still open... Only problem is that the last showings started like 15 minutes prior, so I was like "nah, I don't wanna go see a movie that's already in progress". So we went to Starbucks and I got a caramel frappuccino. Hella good stuff. Unfortunately, it kept me up until way past my bedtime. I got a little tired around 4am, but then my friend called from the east coast, so I talked to him... which was cool. So I went to bed around 7am. AIYA! I woke up around 1pm but I was still tired, so I went back to sleep until 4pm. I woke up and then did jack shit for the next few hours. Then I took a nap around 7pm or so and then woke up around 830. Around 9, I took off for Life Plaza in Rowland Heights to meet up with my friend and his friends. It was nice to get out and chill. So anyway, that was my weekend. What fun.  Oi. So now I'm waiting (sort of) for my friend to call, but who knows. It's like 4am over in New York... and he said was gonna call tonight. But that could mean HIS night, which is later, or MY night, which is now. Aiya. Damn time zones.  On a brighter note, I think I can finagle David to find his Dragons of a Fallen Sun book so I can borrow it. Woot woot. I need to reread that damn thing. I already have Dragons of a Lost Star and Dragons of a Vanished Moon. And I'm waiting for Windwalker to go to paperback so I can buy it. I have the first two books already. Yes, that's right. I like those dungeons and dragons books. In the interim, I believe I'll read The Count of Monte Cristo. Yeah...! Okay, time to go. I need to get some... more rest. Oi.Oi... What a HOT HOT HOT day. I was so happy I was inside the entire day in an air-conditioned building. :) Anyway, not much has happened... other than David breaking up with his girlfriend. I have been waiting for this moment for so long... and although I'm reveling in the fact that he is suffering and in pain, much like how I was way back when, I'm also sad for him. I know exactly what he's going through, but ain't nothing I can do to really help except just be there for him if he needs me. That's what friends are for, right? Right. Anyway, yeah, I finally have my closure and can truly move on. I don't feel so bitter anymore, which is a good thing. Too bad it took this long for me to finally be free of that feeling. Now that I think back on it, I suppose I could have just let bygones be bygones, but I think that I relish the sweet feeling of revenge and retribution. An eye for an eye (or more LOL). It doesn't necessarily make me a bad person, but rather, it makes me a difficult person to get along with. I guess I could change, but only time will tell.  I've never liked change.  Karma... I know that one day, this is all gonna come back and bite me on the ass. I just KNOW it. Damn it.  And this damn heat. Man, sometimes I HATE summertime. The heat is almost unbearable. It almost makes me want to sleep nekkid tonight. Almost, but not quite. I've never slept nekkid before. Almost nekkid, yes (like the time I stumbled into my room, DRUNK, and stripped off all my clothes except for... well, you get the picture), but fully nekkid, no. HAHA. What a blog this is turning out to be. Oh, well. Okay, it's time to go to sleep and put in another 9 hours (8 paid plus 1 hour for lunch) at work tomorrow. 930-630. Damn. I HATE closing. ESPECIALLY on a Friday. Aiite then. PaYcE.AIYA SO FRICKIN' TIRED MAN!!  *sigh* me so tired... not enough sleep... and i work too much. BLAH!!  i think that's it for now. not too much new stuff to talk about and i'm starting to get woozy from lack of sleep.  goose nai ebreeone!So, okay, today was pretty damn long. I mean, not a lot customers, but dood... stupid cash dispenser was out of balance, so I stayed to help my supervisor try to find the outage. No luck. So I came home around 730pm today, which is LATE for me... Oh, well.  So, yeah, I just basically wanted to say today was a typical ho-hum day.  Although, there WAS an expected little twist. Apparently, my ex-boyfriend's bit-  *AHEM*  I mean... well, no, I meant "bitch"... anyway, apparently, she's still out to cause little... creases in my life. It's irritating, and a tad juvenile, to tell you the truth. Okay, so yeah, so this guy finds her on FAP and IM's her... and the little spore (you can always insert another word that rhymes with this (HINT: starts with a "w")) tells him to IM me on BOTH my sn's. Not just one, folks. BOTH. Rather stupid, if you ask me. And it just shows what a small world this really is. I've talked to this guy before on AO-HeLL... troi oi. Good freaking god. Either I need to get myself some new screennames or I need to stop dilly-dallying around on AOL. LOL. Oh, well.  And, yes, I realize that in name-calling, I have also stooped down to her level. I can't help it. I'm still human dammit.  And I have one last thought: My ex-boyfriend sure has downgraded in girlfriends. Hell, I ain't perfect, but I'm sure as hell MUCH better than her.  Okay, okay. That was the last jab, I promise.  :)  PaYcE.CURRENT MOOD:  tired CURRENT SONG:  Linkin Park CURRENT DRINK:  water... is there anything else?  Oi. I'm so tired right now. I think I'm going to go back to sleep. There's nothing I really want to do today, other than maybe go shopping or go have lunch with someone. I just don't know who to call up. Dinner last night was okay. Too bad it lasted in a shorter amount of time than the wait. I didn't feel too well yesterday... I think exhaustion and hunger finally crept up on me and I was feeling really light-headed and woozy, which sucked. I really wanted to see Tomb Raider 2. Oh, well. I guess I'll just see it with Mikey... if I ever get around to calling him up.  :P  Hmmm... what IS there to do right now? I mean, there isn't really anything. I'm not into the beach during the daytime ~ definitely a night time person here. This whole lack of car situation... can be better, I suppose, but it isn't too bad. My parents are really being nice to me and they're letting me take out the Camry, which is cool. I'm trying to not abuse their niceness... so I'm trying to not drive it too often, which kinda sucks. Oh, well.  Last night also marked the start of  People Watch 2003 , which kicked off at Life Plaza in Rowland Heights. LOL. I swear, I didn't think I could sit that long and just watch the people walk by with my sister. I've been hanging out with her a lot more, which is cool, I guess, but I think it'll be good practice so that when we go up to NorCal this weekend, I won't end up killing her. I think her friend, Steve, is coming, too, so that's cool. Steve's a pretty funny guy. LOL. He's coming along to make sure that both sisters return in one piece. My sister and my fights have become more and more violent as of late. I mean, come on... how many people do YOU know would throw a damn IKEA laundry hamper at her sister...? Luckily, she missed. I think. I actually have no idea... I'm still debating on whether or not my little injury back in February was the result of the laundry hamper actually hitting me. Anyway, I guess that's it for now. I will now embark on today's goal of being able to go out. Payce.CURRENT MOOD:  tired and restless CURRENT SONG:  Avril Lavigne - I'm with You CURRENT DRINK:  water  *YAWN*  I'm so tired. I wish I had someone to go out with. Dammit. I hate being old. The older you get, the harder it is to make new friends. Not that I really want anymore... IONO. Anyway, work today was okay. The time really flew by. I got my breaks and my lunch and even got another account opened for my brother, which is cool. I wish I could save like that nukka. It sucks money slips through my fingers like... sand? Is that the right word for that phrase? I forget. I'm really not doing much right now, except listening to Avril. I really like this song. I sang it once in karaoke and someone mentioned I sounded like her. But IONO 'bout that. I think I suck at singing, frankly. I mean, I don't think I'mma be breaking any glass any time soon, but I'm not all that.  I wish... I wish... I wish I had a guy. LOL. Oh, to be held close to someone, feeling their heart beating fast just because you're near, knowing that you'd be safe always... *SIGH*  I'm hungry. And I want Starbucks. Or maybe Jamba Juice. Or maybe Thai iced tea. WTF. I want food dammit. Aiite then, me go now. Bye bye.CURRENT MOOD:  depressed... and it's not getting any better CURRENT SONG:  some sad shit... CURRENT DRINK:  should be a bottle of alcohol, but just water...  *SIGH*  I am bummed. Not just because I don't have my car anymore, but because I realized that I am SO not happy with my life. I didn't care that I hit the wall... well, I did, but more because of the fact that my car was ruined. I wasn't thankful that I was still alive. I just simply didn't care. And that scares me. Am I so materialistic that I care more about the well-being of an inanimate object (unless turned on and driven by me) than I am about my own welfare? *shrug* I have no idea. That depresses me because I like to think I'm not so typical... I mean, I know I am, but in other ways, I'm not.  And so I am bummed. I don't hate my life yet... and I'm certainly not at the point to ending it, but when it comes down to it, I am not happy. Period. My job... is a job. My friends... are my friends. My family... is my family. I don't have anyone close... I think I keep a lot of people at an arm's length.  I am an isolated island in the middle of the vast ocean, with no other land in sight. That's how I feel.  And on that note, I will bid adieu. Maybe go drink some coke or something. Payce.CURRENT MOOD:  hurting and sad... CURRENT SONG:  The All-American Rejects - Swing Swing CURRENT DRINK:  bottled water  *SIGH*  My baby's gone. Well, I'm about 95% sure she's gone. :\  Freaking idiots who brake for no reason.  I'm okay, by the way... just some bruises. Now, I'm trying to convince my dad to let me get the Lexus IS300, but I'm not really getting anywhere with him. I really want the Infiniti G35 Sport Coupe or the Nissan 350Z, but he's not willing to pay for the insurance on a sports car. So... since I'm forced to pick from a 4-door, I'mma shoot for the IS. It's a nice car. If anything, I was trying to go for the BMW 330ci, buuuuuut, yeah, that whole "sports car" factor came up again. Plus, it's more expensive than the Lexus.  *SIGH*CURRENT MOOD: bored CURRENT SONG: Sugarcult - Bouncing off the Walls CURRENT DRINK: strawberry sensation  FOCK. I'm bored. I want to go out, but it's too hot. Maybe when it's cooler. I think my friends are going to call me when they're ready to eat dinner. On the up side, my car got washed, although personally, I could have done a better job. I think I've got a dinner/movie date for next weekend, so I'm happy. I guess. IONO. We'll see. The guy lives in LA, but he's willing to pick me up, so YAY. Another chauffeur (sp?) for me.  =)  I think I'm going to go sleep or something because I'm REALLY bored right now. All I do is sleep. *sigh* PaYcE.CURRENT MOOD:  content CURRENT SONG:  N/A CURRENT DRINK:  bottled water  So, okay, this weekend isn't turning out to be half bad, I guess. Last night, I went with my friend Christina to eat and then check out the Fox Sports Grill @ Irvine Spectrum. Kinda wack. A lot of people... but they're all white, so we weren't really feeling it. Then tonight, I was going to go to some club out in LA, but the guy changed his mind so we went to go see Pirates of the Caribbean (sp?) instead. It was a long movie, but good. Orlando Bloom is definitely cute... and Johnny Depp was cool, too. My hand is getting better, but even more annoying. It's starting to really scar up and it's leaving gross looking bumps. Well, there are three of them, but yeah. Gross. Not much else to say except that I have major munchies right now, but I can't eat, seeing that it's about 330am right now. I want to go out still, but alas, I'm home and cannot leave the house. Damn it. I want my own place. But then again... the rent would be outrageous and unfortunately, this little princess doesn't have the funds as of yet. *SIGH*CURRENT MOOD:  bored CURRENT SONG:  Wu Tang Clan - Gravel Pit CURRENT DRINK:  coke  *YAWN*  The heat makes me sleepy. I've been taking a nap every day for the last few days, which is throwing my sleep schedule all out of wack. Oh, well. Sleep is good.  =)  hehe... I was hella tired last night, though, fo sho... I was dozing off in the middle of all the phone calls I had. I think it had to do something with laying down while talking. LOL. As for now, I'm okay, I guess. I could go back to sleep, if I really wanted to. Hopefully, tomorrow I'll get official word as to when I start at the new branch... Other than that, I really have no new news to give out, so I'mma chat online now. Or maybe play Warcraft 3. I bought that damn expansion pack for a reason, right? Right. Aiite then payce.CURRENT MOOD:  thoughtful CURRENT SONG:  Jimmy Eat World - Just Watch the Fireworks CURRENT DRINK:  bottled water  Well... this has been the most unproductive weekend up to date. With the exception of leaving my house to go to work, my ass didn't do much else. I was going to go shopping today so I can peruse the new additions @ the Coach store, but it was hot, so I decided to take a nap. Well, I woke up @ 6oopm, which meant I would have about 30 minutes to go shopping (I wasn't even ready to go out into the public yet). Oh, well. There's always tomorrow.  I'm tired. Extremely tired. I just want to sleep away all my troubles. Well, I don't have troubles. I know there was something in my last post where I mentioned that I would do something different, but I don't remember. Anyway, my current mood is: thoughtful. More like... WAS thoughtful NOW blank-because-of-exhaustion.  Time to sleep. Tomorrow is a new day. PaYcE.CURRENT MOOD:  content, i think... CURRENT SONG:  daniel bedingfield - if you're not the one CURRENT DRINK:  starbucks caramel frappuccino  I need to sleep. I've got work @ 845am tomorrow, but I really don't feel like it. I think it's because I took a two hour nap earlier today.  :)  I don't think the caffeine from the frappuccino will affect me like it did the last time, so that's always a good thing.  Anyway, I've been thinking about how I've been looking at things lately. I don't know why I am the way I am. I don't know how I became so cynical and sarcastic. I think I used to be a nice girl... a really sweet girl. But that was so long ago, I think I've forgotten how it is to be that girl.  :\  It's a loss, but what can I do? LOL. I always have this horrible outlook on things. I think it's my way of keeping myself from being hurt. A barrier of a sort. I don't know. Anyway, I think I'mma try to have a more positive outlook on things, but the effects will definitely be more long-term than short-term, so don't expect any changes any time soon. This kinda stuff takes time. LOL.  On a bright note, I think I've got the supervisor position over at the South Coast branch, which'll mean more money for me... which means I can finally see paying off my credit card debt in the near future (probably within a year)... which means I can start saving for a new car. But we'll see. I was talking to Jeff about this... and who knows. I might just keep my Mustang until it runs out of domestic steam.  Porsche 911 GT2 here I come. LOL. I wish. That is a $185,000 car... but a girl can dream, right?  Well, time to finish my coffee and then brush my teeth. Maybe call up Brandon... I wonder if he's off work yet... Oh, well. If you'd like, take a look at my website. It's slightly revamped: http://www.geocities.com/swtemmie37. Aiite then I'm out. PaYcE.AM... WILT...ING...  Have I mentioned how much summer sucks sometimes? All these people are on their vacations, living it up... and me... idling away at work, helping those people on vacation. Troi oi. Anyway, yeah, I wish it was winter. Gotta love the bundling up and the cold. Well, did my errands. I returned two DVD's, bought another DVD, and bought an expansion pack for one of my brother's games. But he's paying me back on that, so it's all gravy. I was just doing him a favor. Anyway, I got  How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days . It's really cute. Definitely a chick flick. I'm watching  Simply Irresistible  again, so yeah... that's definitely a cute movie. I'm buying a lot of DVD's lately. I think I'mma quit on that. Racked up over 200 bucks on my Discover card, so that's gonna go back in the case. No more spending! Aiya. What else... Oh, well, I had lunch with Jeff at The Boat in Rowland Heights, which was cool. But when I went to go get my strawberry juice drink at Life Plaza, I got the worst service in the world. The guy took my order, then freaking left to give two other customers their checks before even taking my money. I was standing there for a while, got pissed, and left. WTF is up with that. Freaking makes me remember that a lot of... well, people who work in that area are fucking hella rude. Damn FOBs. THEN, I went to Best Buy, and I stood in line for a good 10 minutes before they helped me. Goddamn, there were life FIVE to SEVEN people at any one time behind the damn counter and ONE person who was actually a real customer being helped. The other person was some stupid employee who decided to get his shit before he left work or something. But either way, I was pissed. Luckily, the person who ended up helping me was a kinda cute white guy, so I was nice to him. Otherwise, I think I would have asked to speak to the manager. Yeah... so today was pretty much Give-Emily-Crappy-Customer-Service Day. WTF. Damn, at least I TRY to be nice to those idiots who come into the bank. Fucking karma. It can be a total bitch sometimes.  So that's my rant for the night. Otherwise, pretty uneventful. Hopefully, this weekend will be good. I'm crossing my fingers... well, obviously not right now since I have to type... well, scratch that. I guess I could type with just one hand, but that would be hella stupid and, not to mention, hella slow. "Hella"... That's an interesting word. I always thought it was strictly a NorCal thing, but apparently, it's used up in Seattle, too, where "soda" is "pop". This guy I know said it one time while we were talking and I thought it was hella cute. "Pop". LOL. So cute...  =)  Okay, time to finish my movie or... chat on AOL. I can't believe I still have that thing... freaking sucking up 15 bucks a month. Oh, well. I need something to kill the time with. Aiite then, PaYcE.Ugh. I woke up with my stomach hurting like crazy. Almost like I'm about to get my period... but I don't even know if it's the right time of the month anymore. Don't ask. Anyway... I need to find myself a new Wednesday lunch buddy. David's totally out of the question now. He's so freaking moody right now, it's almost unbearable... like a freaking girl. Hn.  I thought I was over him. Apparently, I'm not completely. God dammit. Don't get me wrong. It's not like I get all emotional still. I don't. I just find myself bringing him up whenever I'm reminded of him. Good lord. I need to find someone new and FAST. LOL. That or try harder at keeping my mouth shut and not mentioning his name.  Anyway, time to go get ready and do my errands with Jeff. It's good to have him back home. Now I don't have to drive so much. LOL. PaYcE.Hello guys! This blog was created so that we could keep in touch until the day of The Reunion. Also, mucho thanks to Mr Lee's suggestion to place the count-down-meter online!

" Dream the dreams that have never been dreamt. " -- David Bower     The Six Mistakes of Man  1. The delusion that personal gain is made by crushing others. 2. The tendency to worry about things that cannot be changed or corrected. 3. Insisting that a thing is impossible because we cannot accomplish it. 4. Refusal to set aside trivial preferences. 5. Neglecting development and refinement of the mind, and not acquiring the habit of reading or studying. 6. Attempting to compel others to believe and live as we do.

Hopefully  nothing crops up at the very last moment. just 2 days back, we were informed that the  Police knowledge  course would last for 3 days, instead of 2. the test was held at  Training command  (Tracom in short, also known as the Police academy) today.  Everything went smoothly.. in the beginning, we had to march a longass distance to the lecture theatre. then we were brought to air-conditioned classrooms =) we combined classes with  queenstown sec  for the test.. they were pretty.. crazy like us. our PCIs were  really  nice. he allowed us to cheer and stuff while the other classes had to shut their mouths up for the entire 3 hours +..  =P After the test we wenta' change into our quarter Us and this group of annoying fucktards (PCIs) totally abused their authority!  i hate them . i know i once said,  it takes a lot of energy to hate someone . however in this case, they are SO worth to be despised and blacklisted. i hope one of them accidentally comes across my site and reads this. yay. i hate you.   Lunch was  okkaaay . i had carrot cake with  ma'am  jess ,  fungi kor , val,  jeff  and the other CIs. then got home while the rest wenta' catch  charlies angels  full throtle. aaah. tired.. ahaa. anyways!  today  is a special day. so i shall take some time to think about things. take care lovers =D *teehee.I'm moodswinging now, and i'm feeling really giddy...On   wednesday  ...

I was really upset when i found out that there was a 3rd day for the course.  the test . honestly, i would rather go to the kayaking course. * tsssssk . really extremely confused cos i don't know what to do.. until  fungi kor  suggested something.. felt relieved afterwhich.  however ,  mr lau  later sms-ed and said that the test would end at 10am, when my kayaking course starts at 10am too. and it takes like 1 hour to get there by taxi i think. * sighs . geeeshhh okay wanna go polish my boots oredi. ciao friends! =) *huggles*  And  welcome back joanne!  haha. =)Yongjie  makes a great study partner. he shuts up when we're doing work and yaks non-stop while we were having lunch. anyways, i have completed my 3 english essays and humanities source-base assignment. goodie. i know that is not a lot but hey, that's better than staying at home for 24/7 and not doing a single shit rite? teehee.  Now it's time to partehhh at tomorrow's class BBQ!  yeehaw .Puppies for sale    A farmer had some puppies he needed to sell. He painted a sign advertising the pups and set about nailing it to a post on the edge of his yard. As he was driving the last nail into the post, he felt a tug on his overalls. He looked down into the eyes of a little boy.   Mister," he said, "I want to buy one of your puppies."   "Well," said the farmer, as he rubbed the sweat off the back of his neck, "these puppies come from fine parents and cost a good deal of money."   The boy dropped his head for a moment. Then reaching deep into his pocket, he pulled out a handful of change and held it up to the farmer. "I've got thirty-nine cents. Is that enough to take a look?"  "Sure," said the farmer.   And with that he let out a whistle,"Here, Dolly!" he called.  Out from the doghouse and down the ramp ran Dolly followed by four little balls of fur. The little boy pressed his face against the chain link fence. His eyes danced with delight.   As the dogs made their way to the fence, the little boy noticed something else stirring inside the doghouse. Slowly another little ball appeared; this One noticeably smaller. Down the ramp it slid. Then in a somewhat awkward manner the little pup began hobbling toward the others, doing its best to catch up....  "I want that one," the little boy said, pointing to the runt.   The farmer knelt down at the boy's side and said, "Son, you don't want that puppy. He will never be able to run and play with you like these other dogs would."  With that the little boy stepped back from the fence, reached down, and began rolling up one leg of his trousers. In doing so he revealed a steel brace running down both sides of his leg attaching itself to a specially made shoe. Looking back up at the farmer, he said, "You see sir, I don't run too well myself, and he will need someone who understands."The Japanese buffet dinner was wonderful. i'm bloated. i  looove  tempuras. it has been quite some time since i've consumed really really  really  fresh prawns. the chefs prolly deep fried them while those pathetic creatures were still struggling for help =\ haha. i really don't know. i had quite a lot of fun with my god-mother, lil cousin and my grandma. it wasn't that bad afterall. i actually felt quite comfortable around them. i would appreciate it though, if they'd speak up more often and crack some corny jokes! because that is what  my  family usually does. i adore fun people. =D  Anyways, i had  better  wake up by 9.30am tomorrow.  Yongjie  and i might be workin on our homework together. hopefully he is able to make it. besides, i need to write a compo of characterisation all about him! so i should really get to know him better. i would then be killing two birds with one stone.   Yongjie unable to make it = no motivation = zilch productivity!!   * Tsk!!  at least if someone goes, i'll be able to force mahself to do something.I don't know if  urlLink this  can help any of you but i sure did learn a lil' about guitars  urlLink here . just some facts.   Anyways, i'm gonna get changed now. my parents are taking my sissas, cousins, a coupla' relatives and i out to this japanese restaurant at circular road. somehow or rather, i ain't excited about it at all. maybe cos' i don't really feel comfortable eating out with my relatives. it's just  weird . til' then, keep groovin guys.Each morning i awake to the euphonious guitar chords played by my lil' sissa  Serene , which is supposed to be a mimic of an alarm as i do not have a sound proof bedroom door. however, it seems more like a lullaby than an alarm as i am simply reluctant to get out of bed. i have absolutely no life at all. the following is my daily dosage:  - brunch, alone in front of the telly - bath time babeh - computer!  yeehaw!  (im a net geek) - telly time - dinner -  more  telly  - slack and unwind - read (magazines  only !) - nitey mates   Yesterday was mucho productive though. i went ta daddy's club for a swim. not forgetting, i caught  the hulk  with a coupla' seniors. it was an average movie.  I seriously gotta do something about this. sucks big time yo. this will prolly be my last entry ever cos' i will no longer be alive after this night. my parents are going to chop off my head and eat it for supper because i have yet to complete my holiday assignments and i am addicted to the frickin web design programme on my puter.  fuckkkkkkkk . Oh well life wasnt that fun anyways.. everyone who reads this is invited to my funeral. i hope you miss me. TOODLES!!Ever miss getting some old fashioned love letters? you know on paper and with ink.. with postage stamps. considering the rampant spread of e-mail, the chances of actually receiving a real flesh and blood letter are so slim as to be laughable.. but never fear, the internet solves all problems. Since the next best thing to a real love letter is a scanned one,  urlLink here is a site  that has exactly that: scanned love letters. 300 of them!Zuhayr  wants me to teach him how to play the guitar once i have  mastered  it.   Buttttt... since i'm learning it  on my own  (yes without anyone's help! tssk), it'll prolly take me a coupla years -.-" Who knows, i might even give up in just a coupla' days. HA!  It's kinda fun though.. as i was chatting with zuhayr and  jeremy  online last night, i printed out the guitar chords and strummed 2 songs by  avril lavigne , i felt so satisfied. ;) it's very very difficult hey.. fingers pain le. I think i should get some tips from  bingrui  and  huizhen (whitney) then go to  phoebe's  place to do some major jammin with her drumset. that would be cool.I'm piggin out on popcorns now.  Mmmmm.Just as i thought i was at my lowest..   he called  :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)Remember, don't waste time comparing your life to others who seem more fortunate. being fortunate is based on how much peace you have, not how many luxuries or conveniences you have. practice from the heart to make peace with what is, then life gives you more help to change things for the better.  -  Doc ChildreYAY  orz! I'm back from a 3 day 2 night Adventure Training Camp (NPCC) at Pulau Ubin. it was so incredibly enthralling and memorable.  natalie ,  valerene ,  hafiz ,  jeff ,  chihwei  and I were selected among our other squadmates to assist the sirs and ma'ams at the camp. we were considered as NCOs there. =D those secondary 2 kids were so adorable. they could not quit addressing me as "ma'am". same goes for nat and all. that was the very first time i felt.. "BIG".      Day 1   Left school for the jetty at Changi then took a ferry to PU. hiked a long ass distance to the campsite with all the heavy 'barang barang'. the 6 of us were the first to arrive with a coupla' sirs cos we had to unpack all the food rations, tent-pitching equipment and stuff. we had to do most of the 'dirty work'.  The secondary 2 cadets took quite awhile to settle down. they took almost up to 2 hours to pitch their tents (4 to each) when a team of 8 can actually do it in 15 minutes. afterwhich, own activities.. while the NCOs had to take care of a lot of other stuff. so tiring k. dinner was quite fun.. outdoor cooking. had instant noodles and some can food. i looove pineapples! the weird thing is that, everyone at the camp seems to have a fetish for pineapples.  Activities til' damn late. mock campfire was hilarious. the NCOs helped out a lil' in the cheering part then  sir yongfa  did some silly dances.. =D got to know some cute ACS(I) guys cos' i sat beside them during the mock campfire. haha. NCOs took our bath at 11 plus. i slept at.. hmm.. 1am ++? cos this annoying freak sir SO had to wake val, nat and i up in the girls dorm to switch dorms.. *tsk tsk.   But before that.. we were enjoyin ourselves bathing.. while the sec 2s all had to knock it down duno how many? stay in pumpin position.. under sir kiwi.. so don't expect him to be merciful.. cos truthfully, a bunch of em' were blatently rude and rowdy.  very  disappointing.      Day 2   Woke up to the bellowing of  sir benghui  and that  dragonball dude  at 6am ++ during the sec 2's physical training. so many casualties! heard they kana pumping lotsa times. Jeff cooked noodles for nat and i then we became nurses of the day. heh. gotta take care of those poor lil' souls. some were faking. their acting skills seriously suck big time. *sigh*  All left for  the amazing race  around pulau ubin from 9am-4pm.  sir kiwi  made the NCOs in charge of the casualties and we had to stay indoors. they had to do area cleaning! at first i thought sir kiwi was being really mean to get the sick ppl to wash the toilets and stuff. however, sir kiwi has done all those first aid crapola shitznitzz before and he could tell who were really sick and who weren't. power rite. the cadets i was in charge of were really obedient. on the other hand, val's group of boys were a disaster. they tried to lock her in the campers toilet.. sprayed water at her..point middle finger.. blah blah. val complained to  sir alan . all knock it down. sir alan so zai!!!  This new town boy kept asking nat what my name was  then when i walked down the slope to check on them scrubbin the messtins at the campers toilet, he began following me everywhere i went and wanted me to tell him my telephone number, address and 'if i gotta boyfriend or not?' or else he would not stop followin.. he's quite funny larh.. but must maintain NCO standard sia.. haha.. so me just smile at him talk abit and made sure that he wasn't 'eating snake'. then.. hmm.. cleaned somemore.. slacked big time.. let them rest.. very soon it was 4pm plus and the teams from the amazing race returned all bushed. sec 2s kana pumping  again ... this buncha' campers are so nonchalent. Dinner was provided by Mr Lau. (yay!) he treated the NCOs to friedrice. glad he knew we were sick of the instant noodles. campfire til' 10 plus.. er it was quite alright lar. kinda' boring but erm quite funny? once again, they kana pump. *sigh* NCOs took our baths at 11 plus then nat, val and i decided to sleep in the canteen with some of the sirs and ma'ams. sir kiwi spoke to us.. wow.. raised mah confidence level and i really appreciated what he had told us. me was so effin' cold.. practically freezing! could not sleep cos the benches were er, hard? -.-"     Day 3   Woke up early. had lotsa' things to settle cos it's the final day. PT as usual. shared noodles with jeff then packed our bags.. packed rations into boxes.. we were treated like servants and dogs.. did dirty work told by sirs. those mean mean ones from new town especially. i don't quite like em. even had to take out all the 34 sets of bed sheets and pillow covers all those crapola shitznitzz then fold them and all tt... val say next time no job we shld work at ritz carlton hotel clean hotel rooms. -.-" later.. packed those tent equipment.. etc etc from 7am plus to 10 plus just kept being told to do all the work loh. today  sir OJ  allowed us to PUMP THE CADETS! wow. but none of us did.. took group pix then left the campsite.. hiked back to jetty then back to where i belong hehe.   OKie gonna sleep now... toodles.I'm outta' this island for the next 3 days.  Til' then, keep groovin honehs. ^_~urlLink This  is interesting. I scored a 6. =\Morning good people. the weather right now is suprisingly cool. an estimation of 28 degree celsius. bloody awesome hey! I wish some things would stay the way it is. unfortunately,  nic  is right. things do change, people do change. but we can't just put the blame on people/objects. that isn't what life is all about. we have to accommodate ourselves to the new requirements from time to time, which I admit, can suck at times. life is all about challenging ourselves. without obstacles, life would be effin' uninteresting wouldn't it?  That is why I believe everything that we are put to go through in life happens for a cause. we just have to sit back, and think calmly of what we ought to learn from it.Did I mention?  Sir Faizal  got posted to  OCS!  (officer cadet school)  yay!  that's the best mmkay. =D  he wanted to give me a suprise the other day at the campfire but  Bernard  had to ruin everything by leakin it out to me before he could say anything. that butthead.  -.-""""   Sir Faizal rocks me and mah socks.

Girls just wanna have fun..The positive side of life   Living on Earth is expensive, but it does include a free trip around the sun every year.      How long a minute is depends on what side of the bathroom door you're on.   Birthdays are good for you; the more you have, the longer you live.   Happiness comes through doors you didn't even know you left open.   Ever notice that the people who are late are often much jollier than the people who have to wait for them?   You may be only one person in the world, but you may also be the world to one person.   Some mistakes are too much fun to only make once.   Don't cry because it's over; smile because it happened.   A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery on a detour.   Have an awesome day, and know that someone who thinks you're great has thought about you today!..   "And that person was me.".....

However bridge building experts throughout the world thought that this was an impossible feat and told Roebling to forget the idea. It just could not be done. It was not practical. It had never been done before.   Roebling could not ignore the vision he had in his mind of this bridge. He thought about it all the time and he knew deep in his heart that it could be done. He just had to share the dream with someone else. After much discussion and persuasion he managed to convince his son Washington, an up and coming engineer, that the bridge in fact could be built.   Working together for the first time, the father and son developed concepts of how it could be accomplished and how the obstacles could be overcome. With great excitement and inspiration, and the headiness of a wild challenge before them, they hired their crew and began to build their dream bridge.  The project started well, but when it was only a few months underway a tragic accident on the site took the life of John Roebling. Washington was injured and left with a certain amount of brain damage, which resulted in him not being able to walk or talk or even move.    "We told them so." "Crazy men and their crazy dreams." "It`s foolish to chase wild visions."  Everyone had a negative comment to make and felt that the project should be scrapped since the Roeblings were the only ones who knew how the bridge could be built. In spite of his handicap Washington was never discouraged and still had a burning desire to complete the bridge and his mind was still as sharp as ever.   He tried to inspire and pass on his enthusiasm to some of his friends, but they were too daunted by the task. As he lay on his bed in his hospital room, with the sunlight streaming through the windows, a gentle breeze blew the flimsy white curtains apart and he was able to see the sky and the tops of the trees outside for just a moment.   It seemed that there was a message for him not to give up. Suddenly an idea hit him. All he could do was move one finger and he decided to make the best use of it. By moving this, he slowly developed a code of communication with his wife.   He touched his wife's arm with that finger, indicating to her that he wanted her to call the engineers again. Then he used the same method of tapping her arm to tell the engineers what to do. It seemed foolish but the project was under way again.  For 13 years Washington tapped out his instructions with his finger on his wife's arm, until the bridge was finally completed. Today the spectacular Brooklyn Bridge stands in all its glory as a tribute to the triumph of one man's indomitable spirit and his determination not to be defeated by circumstances. It is also a tribute to the engineers and their team work, and to their faith in a man who was considered mad by half the world. It stands too as a tangible monument to the love and devotion of his wife who for 13 long years patiently decoded the messages of her husband and told the engineers what to do.  Perhaps this is one of the best examples of a never-say-die attitude that overcomes a terrible physical handicap and achieves an impossible goal.    + + +  Often when we face obstacles in our day-to-day life, our hurdles seem very small in comparison to what many others have to face... however, The Brooklyn Bridge shows us that dreams that seem impossible can be realised with determination and persistence, no matter what the odds are.  Even the most distant dream, can be realized with determination and persistence.There you go. how's the new layout? aiight, i'm gonna go revise tomorrow's math test. ciao lovers! lotsa' love and friedrice.   P.S  there's a hee-uge storm at my place and i'm scared. i hate storms.Ello ello people! =) how's everyone? thanks for all the geustbook entries btw. i read through every single one and i felt so motivated. especially * clears throat * his. i seem so affected by everyone's moods. when i'm with different people, my mood differs. take for example today.  nic  has been feeling really down due to certain problems. when i was with her i felt depressed too. i was worried. and i scolded her for doing something really foolish. as her friend, i guess all i can do is to advice that poor lil' soul and state my opinions. whether she wants to follow her heart, or take my advice, it's totally up to her. she has the right to decide anyways. then there's  jason ,  jeremy  and  eileen . when i'm with them, i feel as though i am on cloud nine. when eileen and i look at each other. the first thing we do is to laugh out loud. when jeremy and i meet, we sing our favourite songs, he whines, and i talk. when  jason  and i sit beside one another, everything seems to be flowing so naturally. we can simply talk about any thing. his  incredibly  corny jokes make me laugh my ass off.  amily ,  ruth ,  nana  and  jessica  are such cheerful sweethearts, to just look at them in the eye would make my day.  jiax ,  martin  and  fengrui  are the 3  crazy  peeps who are basically the funniest people.. but they can be very very corny too. fengrui likes to challenge me by   suaning   me. so i guess being around him would perfect my suaning skills too. i can remember extremely clearly when i was in secondary 1. haha. it was horrifying. when people  suan-ed  me, i would just smile or giggle. i mean, it wasn't fun at all! i truthfully haven't encountered anything like that when i was in pri skl. because such things don't happen often in an all girls skl. no wonder i didn't have any guy friends besides those 2 sissified guys when i was in sec 1. i've learnt so much during my 2 and a half years here in CTSS. can you imagine how much more we would have to learn in the near future? like SO SO SO SO SO ever SO mucho. and if i do show interest in those stuff, i can gurantee myself that i would be quite a smartie hey? haha. okay.. enough already. but honestly speaking hey, even  samuel  was surprised when he experienced me suaning him back... *teehee.  I am feeling much better so ignore the previous post. i was basically typing out how i felt at that moment. i didn't mean it. on a brighter note, my lil' sister and i have reconciled. haha okok it wasn't that serious but we ignored each other for a night. she designed a postcard and apologised to me. that was before i went for my  kayaking 1 star course  on sunday. *sigh. like, she stayed up til' mid night to do that for me... i said sorry to her too.. because i also made her cry and i wouldn't say i wasn't in the wrong because  i was . as an older sister, i really should've handled the situation by giving in to her. my dad reprimanded me for that. anyway!! now that we've made up, i would so love to squeeze her cheeks =D i want to be a better older sister. i wonder if i am a good one.. people say i am like a mother to them. but at home, it's tough for my lil' sister to respect me and treat me as a role model as much as i wish her to, because i  do not  set a good example! remember i have a list of accomplishments which i want to achieve? i have added that in.. in fact, i have longed to be a good older sister since i was younger.   After assembly today, i went for a lil' shopping spree and spent quite a bit. i felt good letting go some money. anyways, i am off to fill my stomach. so take care ya'll =) lotsa' love and friedrice"Why is everything so confusing?? maybe i'm just out of my mind."  Why i am crying over stupid things and wasting time on stupid things. because im a stupid fool. people take me for granted. people don't care about how i feel. people say this, people say that. since nobody likes the current pearlyn then let's see how it would be like if i were to be stricter, firmer, much much more hard-hearted, bitchier, more selfish, insensitive, inconsiderate and loud.   I currently really hate my life. things are messy. and i just quarelled with my little sister and  i am crying . this is what i get after a tirin day at school. i am already  so drained  from every fucking thing. school. tests. [him]. npcc. homework. friends. annoying sisters. kayaking tests. tuitions. myself. like wow i'm already almost 15 and i am  actually  crying because i think my life sucks. i was SO born a loser hey.  God must hate me, cursed me for eternity.My day was pretty much like  urlLink this...  x)  Anyways, i'm really beat. i'm gonna iron mah uniform, polish mah boots and get ready for tomorrow's np training. there will be changes, and i need to be mentally prepared. do take care friends.First, let me say one thing. i never thought i'd say this, but poor  Britney Spears .  urlLink she seriously sounds like she needs some lovin.  err, wait. i've got something she doesn't! i'm better than you, Britney Spears! feed my ego!   I didn't update on what has been happening at school yesterday. it was helluva' amusing because my  spare tyre ,   jason   (weihoong) is right beside mah.  ms halizah  probably decided to put him and i together because she thinks that i am the only person who can tolerate his wackiness! i love sitting with  karen ,  jeremy ,  jason  and  eileen ! our mouths never get to rest. dang, i love to talk! don't you??! hmm. no wonder  amily  and i got reprimanded by potato head  mrs chen  after bio lessons. * tssk.  anyways, we deserved it, we weren't even cooperating with that poor lil' soul when she was trying to make us focus and understand the chapter. anyhow, we apologised. that made me feel  really guilty . on a brighter note..  (:   HAPPY BIRTHDAY EILEEN!!!   :)   P.S:  he called!! haha. like  OMIGAWSH!!  * faints * lmao..  P.P.S:  i can't wait fer' tmrw! yeehaw!The blow was almost too painful to bear. this was because hopes that conjoined  Iranian twins  Laden and Laleh Bijani would pull through the risky surgery to separate them had soared SO high. even at 1.30pm yesterday after they had been separated, optimism remained high.  Suddenly, within hours, they were both  DEAD .  The team of 6 surgeons and their 100 supporting staff had tried to stem the profuse bleeding. they failed. but we should not allow this tragic setback to douse the fire of our passion to push the frontiers of medical science or have our nerves frayed in the facing similar challenges in future. they are bound to come our way again.  What led to the deaths will be examined and analysed in weeks ahead and something positive would have been learnt, to be shared with the international medical community. the surgeons involved in this operation should be proud that they had the courage to take this calculated risk in trying to help Laden and Laleh when no others in the world wanted to. even the Germans declined to help when they were approached by the sisters in 1996.  the surgeons here knew the outcome could go either way. but more importantly,  the twins knew, too.   the worst has come to pass and this was something the Raffles Hospital team was aware it had to face.  When they were as young as eight, a family friend remembers seeing the pair trying to walk in opposite directions to break free from each other. public hopes that they would survive the surgery, which began on sunday, had taken to the sky partly because of Dr Gog and his team team's success with the Nepalese twins.   Laden and Laleh knew that the operation was highly risky, yet they wanted to go through with it in order to fulfil their hope of being separated.  they faced the challenge with  remarkable  fortitude, optimism and cheerfulness.    -  Extracted from Streats and The Straits Times  -   I was deeply saddened by the news when i was told by my mom yesterday. Laden and Laleh were such adorable common laymen.. they absolutely did not deserve this. what wrong have they done? to choose to lead separate lives? on the other hand, i hope all of us have learnt something from this. we should all appreciate and cherish the people around us. the lives we lead. the things we own. and who we are.  we are undeniably, very lucky . i would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Iranian people and the family of Laden and Laleh.   To everyone who reads this, do take care.   "Ladan and Laleh, like two butterflies have burnt in the candle of destiny, but it is the light of this candle which gives us the hope to continue the endeavour for the betterment of human life."Yay got this off amanda. its actually part of this whole long survey. but oh well i'm only interested in THIS part.

However, the day became really depressing again after i got home. man, my mood sure does fluctuate hey. i received news from  mummy  that the  Iranian twins  have passed away. i turned on the telly to channel news asia and read, " Latest news: Second Iranian twin dies  at the bottom of the screen. * sobs * i feel for them. i sms-ed  amily ,  jess  and  kalyn (dingling) about it..   Anyways, i hope tomorrow would be a better day.Yesterday was really fun :) i woke up at 5.30am and got ready to leave the house at 7am. do you think taking 1 and a half hours to get ready is too effin' long? haha. some people think so.. oh well. anyways, i reached clementi MRT at about 7.30am so i was the earliest! and saw  kenneth  and his friends who were on their way to kallang for the NDP full dress rehearsal.  valerene  came a lil' later and  jess  (ma'am yeewen) arrived late. we took the train to  tampines  and met up with  bernard ,  fungi kor ,  edywn  and  weix kor . afterwhich, we hopped onto bus  19  and it brought us to  CSSC ! (changi sea sports club)  I guess you already have an idea of what i did yesterday hey? haha. yup, you're right. i went  kayaking ! val and i signed up for the  1 star course  which consists of two lessons, both from 10am-5pm.  Our instructors were  serene  and  charles . serene is a NPCC ma'am and i think she's in her twenties. she's very good looking. charles was from NCC and he's quite corny. we changed into our wet attire and intro-ed ourselves to our group memebers! there were 10 of us altogether. val and i were the youngest. most of them were in their twenties.. from poly.. uni..  :) we had a lesson and introduction on the parts of a kayak. then tried to paddle. all the different strokes. we learnt lotsa' stuff yesterday. mainly:  - embarking - disembarking - forward stroke - backward stroke - sweep stroke (360 degrees) - J-draw - capsizing - T/X rescue  I don't have any problems with all the strokes. capsizing is scary but the more i try it, the more exciting it becomes. however, you wouldn't like it when all the salt water gets into your nose. very annoying =\ i personally find T/X rescue the most difficult =( it has to be done in pairs. one person has to rescue, while the other has to capsize on purpose. then the rescuer has to paddle to the capsized kayak, somehow lift the damn heavy thing up onto his/her own kayak with the haul facing upwards to allow all the water to flow out. then your partner (the person who capsized with the kayak) has to hook both legs and arms on one side of the kayak so it appears to be a  see-saw . (both kayaks are in a  t  shape) then you hold on to the deck line and swim to the other side and do the koala-bear hug again. it the kayak tilts and all the water flows out again. later, flip the kayak back with the haul under water then you gotta climb up the kayak with the help of the rescuer, which is damn tough for me.. * sigh * especially when we did it in the deep sea because the waves were so huge =X plus, i'm so heavy! so i need lotsa' arm muscles. haha. i should train up. one time, i kept trying to jump outta the water and flip my body onto the kayak until i had a cramp on my calf. so pain sia! * tsk * i had to do it 3 times altogether yesterday, 2 times compulsory while the other was volunteerily. and all 3 times i got up with the help of my friend. * phew * :)  At about 5pm.. we ended and had to wash our kayaks and trolleys. it was quite fun, i love to play with water hoses. haha. i also spoke to one of my group member...er.. i forgot her name.. i asked if she was a  butch  =\ do you think i was being rude? i hope not.. cos she said she wasn't offended :) she also said that she wouldn't classify herself as a butch. so i just smiled at her and asked if she was ready to carry the kayak over to the shelf. teehee. she's soooo very nice.. she helped out in our rescue by anchoring our kayaks when we were nearer the shore. and she has such huge arm muscles! i learnt that she was a dragon-boater from her partner :) val,  charlene ,  joyce  and i washed our hair in public at the showers and pipes where everyone goes to to wash their kayaks, cos' the shower room was bombarded with peeps. then dried our bodies and got changed. debrief after everything.. and left for dinner with my seniors at changi village :)    WOW , what a day! and i got sun burnt too. but last night i put like duno how many donkey layers of mosturizer cos i don't want my skin to peel. it looks okay now.. gonna return to the usual colour soon. hopefully by tomorrow :)Boney M  *  Rasputin       Ra, ra,  Rasputin , Russia's greatest love machine!  my personal pick of the week, this mp3 is not only a historical song (although not exactly accurate) which we (3B1) have learnt just last week (the Russian revolution), but also comic relief. we love Russia, yes we do. listen to it or else your fate will be similar to Rasputin's.      ((LYRICS))  There lived a certain man in Russia long ago He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow Most people looked at him with terror and with fear But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear He could preach the bible like a preacher Full of ecstacy and fire But he also was the kind of teacher Women would desire  RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen There was a cat that really was gone RA RA RASPUTIN Russia's greatest love machine It was a shame how he carried on  He ruled the Russian land and never mind the czar But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar In all affairs of state he was the man to please But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze For the queen he was no wheeler dealer Though she'd heard the things he'd done She believed he was a holy healer Who would heal her son  But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power became known to more and more people, the demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and louder.  "This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please" No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms Then one night some men of higher standing Set a trap, they're not to blame "Come to visit us" they kept demanding And he really came  RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen They put some poison into his wine RA RA RASPUTIN Russia's greatest love machine He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"  RA RA RASPUTIN Lover of the Russian queen They didn't quit, they wanted his head RA RA RASPUTIN Russia's greatest love machine And so they shot him till he was dead  Oh, those Russians...Most of my best friends would probably know how reluctant i am when it comes to getting married and having babies, although i adore lil' kids to pieces. however, right now, i have completely changed my thoughts about that. i repeat, i wanna make love and have a baby like this!!!         I can imagine myself breast-feeding this adorable baby already :D :D :D * aww *  Credits:  urlLink ash's photologHi ladybugs!  I needed to let go of myself  really  badly from all the stress. i shan't elaborate since it isn't necessary, hence, last night when i met  nora sweetheart  online, we decided to hang out today and have some gurly fun.  I took a cab to town then met her at 10.15am. we took stickers prints from 2 different machines at the annexe. 8 beam and this other new hee-uge machine. it's so model-like and seemed sophisticated. and in one of the snapshots i carried her! and she was really amazed by my sheer strength. anyhow, we bought tix to catch  charlies angels: full throttle  at 11am in cineleisure.. =P  it was soooo awesome ya!!  it  really  kicked butt. we were yakking all about it while we were on our way back to the heeren shops. afterwhich, we took prince machine sticker prints (which is the bessstt haha.) and went window shopping.. cause at that point i have already spent  $50 .. so yeah.. broke  again . waiting for nicco to return me $$ =\\ looked fer' necklaces.. adidas sweaters and a  urlLink ripcurl  sling bag.  nora  and i are gonna buy that sling bag together! hopefully by the time we save up...it's still being sold =D  dang.. we fell madly in love with it upon setting our eyes on it. nora and i have minds that are so alike. we keep sayin the same things at the exact same time. haha.   After everything, we proceeded to some mandarin hotel for a seminar.. then we saw  urlLink imran ! haha. it was sooo funny i tell ya. we went in and were strolling around the lobby when nora saw this malay boy in the  SJI  uniform. then she was all "oh my god, is that imran?" and we began freaking out. hahaa.. later she and i hugged each other goodbye.. =) we would be meeting in a month's time. teehee. oh yup, if you're wondering who nora is, well, we met through the help of  BARDOT ! haha. erm, cos we were once crazeee over bardot. then somehow we began chatting over the internet (and she had a website too) and decided to meet up one day. she's one of the many internet peeps i've met up with.. =) and i lub her. she lubs me too! *huggles*   Click below for sticker prints!  urlLink Sticker print 1   urlLink Sticker print 2urlLink Photos  of the BBQ at west coast =)   (V)  (>'-') o(")(")Everything is going to be all right, why should I not be glad? to contemplate the clouds clearing beyond the dormer window and a high tide reflecting on the ceiling.  There will be dying, there will be crying,  but there is no need to go into that. The poems will flow from the heart unbidden and the hidden source is the watchful heart. The sun will rise despite everything and the far cities are beautiful and bright. I lie here in a riot of sunlight watching the daybreak and the clouds flying, everything is going to be all rightI was devastated!! all I could think about was,  "why me" ? i just couldn't believe what was happening.. it was so unjustified. i plucked up my courage, spun around, and cleared my desk. i held my books on one arm and my bag in the other. i ambled across the classroom and settled down at the other side of the class. my new seating partner?  Joshua .  I have to  thank   yulun . for the past coupla' days, he has been teasing me about  "si-car-lly"  sitting with joshua. especially when we wenta' the mall that day. he was all, "  WHAT IF  you were to sit with joshua? what would you do?  i casually replied while laughing out loud,  "haha that is impossible! it can't be that coincidental right?"    Then this morning when i saw the new class seating plan, i nearly passed out. i was scanning the piece of paper. i finally saw my name. i was anxious to read the name of the person who would be sitting beside moi. very very nervous. everything seemed so...  slow motion-ed , and so dramatic.   Indeed , it turned out to be J-O-S-H-U-A.     Wow , life is overwhelmed with  irony , ain't it??   My life rocks .   Jiax  and i gave  ms halizah  the cold shoulder today. gave her attitude prob during her 5 lessons with us too. cos' basically, jiax can't sit with  jason (weihoong). they quarrel 24/7 and just can't get along. as for me, it is a fact that josh really is pretty dirty when it comes to personal hygiene =\ and i can't quite get along with him either. don't say i ain't trying, i have. we are okay together.. but, i can't open up to him like i do to  yulun . we don't joke, we don't talk, we don't laugh, we don't sing, we don't do anything together! and it really sucks if i have to sit with the same person for the entire day when we don't even communicate.  i miss yulun....  * bleahx*  well, not only did ms halizah put jiax and i with somebody whom we don't feel comfy around with, she put jiax,  fengrui (gabriel kor),  yulun (martin kor) and i each at a different corner. and  nic  is right at the centre.  kalyn (dingling) got to sit with fengrui. sighs. at least they can still talk..  amily  is sitting with  jeremy  kor. =( *sobs* how cool.  jess  sitting with  hafiz ,  ruth  and  simon . aaahhh.. my best friends are all so far away.. so so far away.  During the peer leaders and prefects' meeting after skl, jason told me that he has informed ms halizah about wanting to change his seats. he told her that he wouldn't mind sitting with me. so hopefully, ms halizah would put us together. i am praying SO hard that this would happen.I bet there were more than 150 of us who were late today. i was one of them. the gate was closed sooo early..  eileen  and i ran for it and mdm reenuka(sp?) shut it right in front of our noses. * tsk tsk . had bio lessons..  mrs chen  was quite alright. better than i had expected. i preferred her style of teaching. physics were really funn ;) i lub  mr chin . haha. he talks to us a lot.. after recess had english..  yulun  said he wouldn't get called but he finally did.. after i shouted his index no soooo many times,  ms koh  finally wrote it on the board and he had to go up to write down the movie review stuff. serves him right. lol. he was sitting there shaking his leg all along.  and if you're wondering why i sometimes shift my desk away from him, it's because he always annoys me with all the nonsensical critisisms bt' ms koh whenever it's her lesson. and i can't stand it. i like ms koh. then he talks about all these really silly stuff and fantasizes about his girl TO ME. -.-"""" ms koh hadta' talk to him privately cos' he wrote " steamy scenes " on the whiteboard. ttaaaahaa. anyways, today is prolly my last day sitting with him..so.. yeah.  saaddd . gonna miss my best budd yo. * sigh . i really hope ms halizah wouldn't change my seat tmrw..   After skl.. wenta'  JP  with  jess  and  amily  meis.. :)) hahaa.. walked and walked..silly amily spent like $40 on pressies.. lol.. then she kept complaining and askin herself why she ended up spending so much.. lol.. then i saw my nokia 2100 cover.. i asked about 5 ppl oredi.. all 5 said  pink  suits me best.. so i'm prolly gonna save up and buy the pink cover.. then ate the snow ice thingy with hersheys chocolate syrup  YUUUUMMmmmm .. hahaa. kkies ;) betta' go find my physics file now.. i lost it =\ .. tc lovers (:This morning was pretty much lifeless cos' the first 2 periods were occupied by humanities. i enjoy history. yet i feel that it is boring. math was a total disaster. mr lee was absent. i hope he's ok.. heard that he's real sick. =\ the relief teachers seem to be tryin their best to teach and convey their msg to us.. however, it wouldn't work cos they have insufficient experience. they have absolutely  no idea  how to handle  young adults  (according to jiax) like us. scholars are smart. but so what if they're smart? some of them do not know how to apply the practical skills. this shows that  being intelligent isn't all . in this case, i'm talking about the new trainee teachers who are scholars. hopefully they'll be able to adjust themselves in this totally new environment. =) soon.  P.E was okaayy.. did conditioning once again cos' our physical fitness test is just around the corner! *eeks. 5 rounds.. and total 25 push ups and sit ups. then hadta' run another 7 rounds.. but penny ang said 2 can le. =) *hug hug* so nice. discount until so much. =P later.. english lessons.. quite boring =\\ physics was quite fun.  mr chin  likes to play with us. chinese was monsterous, since  liu jian  is always here to condemn and lecture us.   Bio was damn slack. we have a new teacher.  mrs chen . it was like a TPI lesson. she intro herself. made us intro ourselves. do some worksheet about ourselves. then write a list of friends + a word to describe them. asked her quesn. took up 2 periods.  viola , skl ended at 3pm. yay =)  Went home with  kalyn ,  ruth  and  yulun . he wanted me to go to westmall with him to buy puter parts. said tt if he didn't have enough $$, i can be his ATM machine. * tsk . couldn't find his stuff. boo. hmm. forced me to wait for the 173 bus with him. wait for sooo effin long. that yulun ah... he knows me too well. he knows tt i won't get angry with him, will always forgive him and can put up with his nonsense. he's like.. the one who can really make my day.. even when i'm damn depressed.. his  clone  conversation (inside joke) really cracks me up. oh wells, enough about the maniac. very tired.. gonna eat dinner (: tc guys!Friends matter the most to me. so if one of them would have to go away some day, i would happily let him/her go, although i'm going to be undeniably reluctant to. if letting them go makes them happy, i would be contented. the same goes for the special someone whom you love. i'm sure you'd want the best for him/her, wouldn't you? =)   i would.Note to  debre  and ex rgps peeps, i'm going back tmrw..those who're reading this from rg and know me wanna meet in skl or smth? anyways,  happy teachers day ! teehee. tmrw im pulling curtains - stage coordinator. must clap for me sia. very tiring pull curtain one leh. haha. keke ciao people. missing ya. :)Ahola :) how's everyone? me is... fine :) i miss blogging. life without the internet connection is honestly incredibly boring. i have like, absolutely no life at all. anyways, we're supposd to have history lesson under mrs raja now. but she's not here, gotta do source based qns but didn't bring moi hist book. *sigh*. mr woon is here. he's like SO nice. let me use the comp. teehee. =P oh yupp, just a random thought, mr lee is sucha' hip hop teacher. keke. he's just really caring..he is an epitome of a loving father. *hugs hugs*   This morning something pretty unpleasant happened. if  YOU  are reading this, i REALLY hope you realise that you're being extremely foolish and incredibly immature. you made me change my mind about how i felt about you. don't think that just cos' you have a powerful back up you can bully your fellow mates aiight. remember, you will lose that back up some day. and on that very day you lose that back up, people are going to  get back at you for what you have done to them . it won't be very nice then hey.

P.S:  Click  urlLink HERE  to view the photos taken at Geetha's house :)Dear Sonority,  The poem below was taken from this book by Sean Sheehan, "The Holocaust: The Death Camps". i borrowed it from the library today and began reading it as soon as i got home because it is  unbelievably  interesting. it is certainly depressing to know the harsh conditions people were living in though. not forgetting the macabre process of mass murder. * ewww .  I met up with Jeremy and Jason(weihoong) at school this morning to ask Miss Halizah questions on the holiday homework. she re-taught the entire chapter on moles and it helped us quite a bit. the problem with jeremy and i is that, we are  able  to memorise the fomula, BUT, we're not sure how to apply them to the questions. =\ so sucky right? hehe. ah well. anyhow! she went really slow and i managed to catch what she was explaining. not many people know the patient and soft side of Miss Halizah i guess. i myself was surprised! =)  After attempting the questions, we just sat there and chilled with her. talked crap and also watched the graduates strutting their stuffs hahaa! many of them dressed up really elegantly and formally. but like what miss halizah had mentioned, Singapore's proms can't be compared to the ones in the states/west where guys pick the girls up in their dad's car! haha! which is so true. anyways, they're still underage, and that kinda' stinks. my sister from crescent girls will be attending her prom night in several hours time. she bought this beautiful tube gown, dyed her hair, permed it and i don't know what else is she gonna do to herself, but i believe she'll look awesome tonight!! i'm so happy for her! she'll be staying over at The Oriental with her NCC mates too. all squeeze into 1 room. i bet it's gonna be one helluva' slumber party! teehee. i wouldn't mind getting drunk with my mates there if i were her.  I pity our graduates though. i pity myself too! graduation in school is rather..pathetic! yes, that's zee perfect word to describe the occasion and venue. hmm. we were discussing about how their make-up's gonna melt due to the uber hot weather. i saw almost everyone ambling into the school gate. mr hang dressed up for the occasion. mss koh too. miss shelley low especially! woah! she was, "radiant"! hehe. here is my pick for the best dressed! (dress+make up+attitude)   BEST DRESSED MALE:   Melvin Tan    BEST DRESSED FEMALE:  The tanned, slim, tall netballer with straight long hair. a pity i don't know her name!  It was so cool. huishan was standing near the gate with a camera crew (MRL). somewhat like the Star Awards!I keep forgetting   I keep forgetting the facts and statistics and each time i need to know them.  I look up books these books line twelve shelves in my room.  I know where to go to confirm the fact that in the Warsaw ghetto there were 7.2 people per room.  and how many bodies they crammed in Auschwitz at the peak of production.  twelve thousand a day i have to check and re-check...  and did i dream that at 4pm on the 19th January 58,000 emaciated inmates were marched out of Auschwitz.  ... i can remember people's conversations and what someone's wife said to someone else's husband.  what a good memory you have people tell me.  ( I keep forgetting by Lily Brett, quoted from Hilda Schiff  Holocaust Poetry  )Dear Sonority,  On  tuesday , Geetha invited Kalyn(dingling) and i over to her place to bake cookies. her aunt's secret cookie recipe is unbelievably enticing. YUMMY! we also had a manicure and peticure session. kalyn is like the expert in this area, she brought an entire set of buffer, nail cutter, etc! i was rather amused when i saw what she had brought along. haha. she taught me how to go about doing this and that and it was really interesting! i painted my toe nails black and coated them with layers of glittery sparkles, bearing in mind what my lil' sis had mentioned earlier, that i don't look too good in black varnish. "too gothic." but she said that by adding the glitter, it appears much more rad. geetha and kalyn looked wicked too! ;)    Yesterday  was special. i didn't have to go to school whatsoever, hence i just watched telly and chilled at home. i saw the "ice cream show" on the discovery travel and adventure channel and i'm  amazed  by the amount of ice cream the Americans consume! it's  scary    Today  was extemely productive. the dance practice went smoothly, although the beginning of the prac was uber lame! we couldn't find a suitable spot for the dance as the juniors were using the NP room. so val decided to proceed to the FIELD! so we danced in front of the express way and the HDB flats to be ridiculed at. how corny! we practiced for a lil' while before using the NP room cos' the juniors weren't quite ready yet. you know, always make use of your time wisely, don't waste precious moments. =) we danced like dunno how many donkey times and finally ended at about 10.30am. teehee. wenta' ask mr lee math questions and offered friends and teachers the cookies which geetha, kalyn and i had baked! mr azmi thought i was going to poison him. oooh, do i look like that type of person? sigh. haha! he was pretty comical. qingrui ate it. gerry too. all my squadmates and a coupla juniors did. (they commented on how yummy it was!) mr lee was the only teacher who happily munched on it. mr azmi ah...sigh X 10000!  Afterwhich, val, sir alan and i wenta' JP to watch " Rugrats go wild! " it's sucha kick-butt movie!! i noticed that i was one of the many who laughed away throughout the entire movie cos i'm a fan of The Wild Thornberrys and i think Debby ROCKS! (although seemingly bossy) while val and alan were like stoning while i'm laughing away...haha. but overall yes, it's smashing! (hehe again, inside joke by Nigel Thornberry!) i would give it a  4/5 . =)5 Easy Steps to Suicide Enlightenment   Did your boyfriend/girlfriend just break up with you, parents getting a divorce, have no friends, just got an f, these are all perfect reasons to end your life and all the suffering such things bring. Without further ado let's get the gun loaded and ready:   STEP 1: The first step to having a successful suicide attempt is to give off signals that you are becoming suicidal. That way when you pull the trigger, people feel more blame for having ignored your hints and then you affect even more people then just yourself. This is key to ending your worthless, hard life. The first thing you need to due is become anti-social. Friends going to the movies and then some ice cream? Not you, you are going to sit at home in the dark and listen to Dashboard Confessional, and when someone asks you what is wrong you will say "Nothing, I'm just tired", but when you say this, it is key that you give off the "I'm full of shit and want to kill myself look". Seclude yourself. Be pessimistic.   STEP 2: After giving off hints, it is time to confide in a friend or write letters and let your friends find them. When your friends address you and offer their help, make sure you deny it and again say "Nothing is wrong", be convincing this time, I don't want them to stop you from ending your life. When your parents get worried and start to pry into your personal life, give them the guilt trip and then go upstairs, lock yourself in your room, and make slits in your arm but make sure they are not noticeable and will only be seen by your friends. If your parents see this your attempt at riding the world of a dipshi....depressed person with a meaningless life will be ruined. RUINED, I TELL YOU. First 2 steps are easy enough, now comes the time to write your suicide note and pick your weapon of choice.  STEP 3: Make sure that you become such an outcast that people at school start to make fun of you. So when you finally end your life they feel the repercussions as well. Be sure a day or two before you do it that when someone blurts out "Hey fatty" you counter with "You know you could make someone kill themself with comments like that" and hope they say "Please kill yourself." If they say the that, it will be a great feeling you give them when they find out you did what they wanted. Also be sure to hit yourself or create some kind of pain when they call you names, so they think you are a freak. It is important that you create this loner image-- be sure to sell it.  STEP 4: Writing the suicide note is the most important thing. This are the last words people will remember you by. Since this is crucial I will give you a template suicide note and you can fill in the blanks where you see fit.     Dear insert name here,  I can't live with this sadness no longer. I needed to end the suffering before I affected others, it was the only way out of the pain. For "insert your age years" I have lived with this pain. Now it has come to a close and will no longer eat away at me.  Mom and Dad - it is not your fault, you guys were great even though I didn't get that $40,000 pony when I was 7, it wasn't that or the time you were 10 minutes late to pick me up from "insert best friend name". I love you guys and want you to know that it isn't your fault.  Boyfriends/ girlfriend's name - I love you, but how could you cheat on me with that stupid slut. After you told me we were going to get married. We had been going out 2 months and you just did that to me, but it isn't all because of you. We were gonna run away and live by the ocean and have a baby each day of our healthy lives. I knew I couldn't make anyone happy or even myself. Remember me forever and don't forget the precious times we had together.  Mom and Dad please don't cry over me, and I am sorry my "insert comment of how your body or guts will be found" the last thing I wanted to due was hurt anyone. However there was no other choice.   insert partial poem or quote about life  your name here     STEP 5: Copy that word for word and you will be sure to give your family members and loved ones the greatest gift of life. Now on to following through with your stu...suicide. I would suggest taking a gun to your temple or in the mouth it is the least painful and you will have a closed casket so no one has to see your "ugly ass" one last time. Also the walls will be stained with your blood which is the perfect everlasting memory to give to your parents. Be sure to have a picture of your parents and you near the scene of the suicide to add to the effect. If you find that too gruesome or do not have a handgun readily available, then I suggest hanging yourself when your parents leave and do it right in front of the front door, so when they get back from "ignoring their picture perfect child" they will see your body swaying side to side. This will make them feel even more responsible because they left you alone. We all know that you should never leave your kid alone at home. If you do not feel like doing this then swallow some kind of poison or pills or slit your wrist, however I highly recommend one of the first two options; the others are not as gruesome and do not have as much lasting affect.  If you are considering committing suicide or you know someone who wants to, please let them read this so they can get through it and end their life. The easy way out is not to be a reasonable person and realize that shit happens and move on, but to kill yourself. Realize there are no other options and get on with the show. Also if you could record it and have the tape sent to me that would be awesome. If you have problems pulling the trigger remember Nike...Just do it. So what are you waiting for...CLICK CLICK BOOM.

By the way, they aren't called "Sex bracelets" in Singapore if i'm not wrong? from what nic and eileen had mentioned to me earlier, they're called "F*** bracelets". ahaha! nice one.Dear Sonority,  How's it going? i went bowling and chilled at west bowl yesterday after training, before returning home to watch the match of this season! hehs, if you have no idea what am i blabbering about, it's the rugby world cup finals between aussie and england! england won  20 - 17 . i wish i was in sydney among the thousands of spectators cos the vibe was sooo awesome!!

After being the focus of attention for practically the entire tournament, Wilkinson – under extreme pressure -- slotted the decider to secure the Webb-Ellis Cup for the Martin Johnson-led English. It followed a titanic fight-back from the Wallabies who went close to becoming the first team to defend a Rugby World Cup title and the first to come back after trailing at the half in a Final. England led 14-5 at the break after tries to Lote Tuquiri for Australia and Jason Robinson for England. The scores had been locked at  14-14 at full-time , after  Elton Flatley  kicked a dramatic last-minute penalty to draw Australia level. Flatley had earlier kicked two second-half penalties to close gap to three points. England led 17-14 after Wilkinson's fourth penalty early in the first period of extra time. But Flatley replied with another last-gasp penalty to level the scores again at 20-20 before Wilkinson clinched the decider in the last minute of extra-time. It was only the second time a RWC Final had gone to extra-time, securing  England's first every championship , and the first for northern hemisphere teams in Rugby World Cups. Australia's epic performance was also widely acknowledged, despite being the Wallabies' first ever loss in a Final.   ENGLAND AUSTRALIA   20  (14) Score  17  (14) Jason Robinson Tries Lote Tuquiri Cons  Jonny Wilkinson 4 Pens Elton Flatley 4  Jonny Wilkinson Drop-Goals     The match was incredibly exciting, although i was rather disappointed that the Wallabies (Australia) were defeated. i felt as though i was a part of England because when they were on stage victorious, tears welled up in my eyes, and i thought i was about to cry. i was touched, and felt elated for the English. to those who have missed the  urlLink Rugby World Cup  finals between England and Australia, be sure to catch the encore telecast if there is one.Dear Sonority,  Time for the  urlLink friday five !   1.

Alrighty, for all those with  urlLink Friendster , do add me mmkays? keep grooving lovers! *huggles*Dear Sonority,  I am still enjoying the after effects of all the fun I had at  Mr Lee's BBQ  party last night. i was physically drained, but mentally awake although i was in bed at 12 midnight..haha. i had to force myself to sleep. =\   Anyways, Mr Lee met up with Wenxing, nic(amelia), simon, jeremy and i at IMM in the afternoon and bought our BBQ essentials. he drove us to his place and the guys ganged up against me. made me sit in front with Mr Lee. it was kinda' embarrasing cos' they wouldn't stop teasing me..especially simon and wenxing! *grrrr!!!* how annoying can those silly fellas get? at one point when it was really sunny, mr lee helped me put down the shade above me, then wenxing was all " did you all see that? " that freaking a**h*** said it so loudly and they were all cracking up then mr lee was like " see what? " all blur. my gosh, i swear i could've kicked wenxings balls then. *grr!* so paiseh..  The entire BBQ went really well. the weather was awesome and everything went on smoothly although there was an excess in food. wenxing was so frustrated cos' he couldn't cut the stingray! haha! cut until the knife BENT! another hilarious scene was while preparing food before the rest arrived, mr lee tried to cut the corn using the knife and the corn was flying all over the place! he didn't succeed in cutting them so i was like, "you don't help out in the kitchen at home do ya?" and he was like "yaa!" with a grin flashed across his cheeks. haha!  We had a "moon-tan" and caught up with one another. geetha, karen, eileen, peiwen, dingling, gerry and i tried to push our girlfriends down * eh hem * while strolling at the edge of the pool. haha! mission unaccomplished though, and gerry and geetha slipped and fell on their butts!  oouuccch!!  we all broke out in laughter. tehee. those poor lil' souls who fell on their butts.  Mr Lee had chats with all of us and we kept asking him about his sons. so we finally went upstairs and i think he asked his son to come out...but he was all shy, and so were we. so never talk to him. * aww ..* but he is   really  good-looking . he has the  ACS(I)+outdoor sporty+smart+skater  look. very cheeky face too. (btw, he skates! so hip hop rite?) and according to ruth, he is in ACS(I). so like, wow, ellidegable bachelor huh? but seriously jess, he's much cuter than your  tuna ! keke..just kidding. don slaughter me.   After a looooong day, daddy picked ruth, dingling, yulun and i up at about 10pm..sooo exhausted! keke, if you're interested to see some of zee photos, click  urlLink HERE ! haha. had heaps of fun and we have to thank Mr and Mrs Lee for this awesome party. =D  So long mates! tata!Dear Sonority,  I shall gladly admit that  today  is one of the  *BEST DAY OF MY LIFE!*  I had just taken a bath after returning home from  Mr Lee's BBQ  at his condo. it was   amazing  . so wild, so fun, so crazy, so happy, so delicious, so  shuai (his sons) and so WET that i will always remember this day.      17th November 2003     Mr Lee and 3B1'03 rocks me and my socks!      Always ... (Shall blog more tomorrow) Good night for now.Dear Sonority,  New layout up! i had just unknowingly given away several millions (or billions?) of NP to Zuhayr. *sniffle sniffle* that lucky boy...i honestly didn't realise that i had mansions worth of money in my account which i haven't touched for donkey years. grieve, i shall not, because if i ever play neopets again i would SO get hooked.  Anyways! Mr Lee's BBQ is tomorrow and i'm exhilarated. keep loving sweethearts. peace out. xox.Dear Sonority,  I had a haircut! actually, i had it trimmed and layered. however, according to my sis(cherryn), it looks the same. i also bought black nail varnish and it looks really gothic. then serene says it doesn't suit me. i tried to remove it, but the varnish seems to have gone under my nail!? arrrgh! i think i need some help here..  Anyways, i'm really anxious about tomorrow's campcraft selection. i'm not afraid of  not  getting into the team, i'm just, nervous that it might be too tough to handle. another cause of worry would be the attendance of my squad and my juniors. we are expected to pump 10 times for every NCO who doesn't turn up. and 8 of them didn't turn up during the previous training. *gulps*  I did  urlLink this  cos' i felt like i didn't have a life. * boredom envelops pearls *Spare a thought for Mrs Lee:   Senior Minister Lee continues to worry for Singapore, at the ripe age of 80, when many of his peers have retired and are enjoying life. We continue to benefit from his views, so if his wife is not all right, he is not going to be able to focus. From what i read, Mrs Lee took care of the family while Mr Lee took care of the nation. any married man will tell you that that takes a lot of sacrifice. cost of medical treatment for Mrs Lee? At this time we should be asking, "Mrs Lee, are you feeling better?"  --  The Straits Times   It is ironical that some Singaporeans should question the integrity of SM Lee. it is indeed very sad. sigh. hopefully both SM and Mrs Lee recovers speedily.Wednesday, and i love you still.  Days pass, boys and men talk to and at me, of love or the feelings that they imagine to be sweet, and it's all very nice, and i take comfort where i may, but my brain and body ache after you.Dear Sonority,   Geetha, Jessica, Ruth and i hit the gym this late morning to shed off some calories after history lessons. we met up with Amelia in the noon to check out the prices of the BBQ essentials and cracked up at every lilttle thing we talked about. it was difficult to make a choice between the two bottles of wine we saw, which we thought would make an excellent gift for Mr Lee. both wine bottles looked incredibly exquisite. Geetha mentioned that yam biscuits would be suitable for him whereas Jess felt that Yun Nam haircare vouchers were more benifitting. i thought it would be a GREAT idea to leave   our   mobile phone numbers in a box of ferrero rocher for his 3 sons.  Regarding my previous post, difficult times have helped me to understand better than before, how infinitely rich and beautiful life is in every way.    urlLink Chuang Tzu  quotes, "Flow with whatever is happening and let your mind be free. stay centered by accepting whatever you are doing. this is the ultimate."Dear Sonority,   Life at this stage of my life is pretty different...  Have you ever encountered a specific point in life whereby this huge change occurs in yourself you don't even realise what you're doing, whether or not it hurts your friends, family members or even yourself? sometimes, you're doing it because it provides support for your ego and sometimes you stay in that position out of sheer inertia because others expect it of you.   I hope that no one hates or holds a grudge against me. cos nobody is truly perfect. ultimately humans will never be perfect, maybe 99% but not 100%.  Just like a diamond, i hope i will be polished into a better person...Dear Sonority,   I WAS drunk last night at my cousin's only after drinking a teeny weeny bit of alcohol while enjoying the rugby match. and i'm suprised there was no typo in that post or should i say 'short statement.' ignore the previous entry, it doesn't seem to make sense. "heart-poundingly"? what was i thinking? and also when i think sober, i talked a lot, to a lot of people and now i 'kinda' regret it.  The regret that makes u go "i ain't drinking and talking after it no more!"   Did you guys watch the  urlLink rugby world cup  match last night when England played against Wales? friggin' awesome wasn't it!?  prince Harry  was present too... * awwwwsh *"You sound like an orgastic trumpet." "You can say that again." --My sisters, apparently trying to tell me how i sound like while blowing my nose.   Oh alcohol..sweet heavenly alcohol.  Thank you for being so accepting and for everything you do to my body.   Gotta go and catch some sleep..a few hours left. Heart-poundingly.. is there even such a word?!..There is a fake commercial on Nickelodeon about "Scream in a Box" as a device to keep you awake and give you more time to do things. Maybe I need that. I waste too much time on stuff like Neopets (brutal honesty here). I'm behind transcribing my notes from my "Exploring the Visual Arts" class. I've been putting them online so I can include links that I've looked up. I don't know if this is all a waste of time or what. Anyway, I was up til about 2:30 this morning and didn't finish Monday's notes. When I came home from picking the girls up from school, I was hoping to do today's notes. Well, I don't have time. I'll have to do them tonight when I get off work. Great. Sleep - what's that?  I want to change the template of this blog, but again, no time. Later, later, later...This is my first published post on Blogspot. I tried multiple times to use Blogger to ftp to my website, but it just wouldn't work. I give up. I'll adjust. Now I'll be able to have archives and not have to change each week. I started blogging when my site was on Geocities. Each week I would rename the week's blog to indicate the date, add a link to the archive page, and start a new blog page with a new graphic scheme. That part was kind of cool, choosing a theme for the week. But, the whole thing is becoming unwieldy and could be a nightmare if allowed to continue.  So, I started looking at blogging website services. Geocities doesn't allow you to ftp unless you are paying for their service. So, I moved my site to my isp. I'm paying for their service already, so why not? I've found it's easier to update now and ftp is a breeze. However, the blogging services I've looked at mostly require you to use cgi or perl (or, of course, ftp) and I don't know what permissions I have and right now, I'm not interested in finding out.  Change of subject: we've had freezing rain in our area, north-central Iowa. Schools have closed or are dismissing early. I'm driving back to town now to pick my kids up before it gets worse. Fun.Letter to the Editor ... or something ...   To the Editor: Some people spend a few minutes in the morning clearing the frost or ice off their car windows. Other people clear a tiny space and hope the people who are more careful will see them first.  I  spent the time this morning to clear my car windows so I could drive safely and not be a hazard to others. I was nearly in an accident, however, when someone who clearly could not spend the time to clear their windows pulled out on the street in front of me. I slammed on my brakes and honked, so lady, yes, I'm talking to  you . I could see through your back window that you were crouching down, peering through a space at the bottom of your windshield that was, maybe, six inches high and about half of the width of your windshield. You pulled out in front of me because you apparently didn't think you needed to clear your side windows. After all, even though  you  didn't take the time to clear your windows, other people must, therefore you don't need to worry. Every driver out there is looking out for you. We are making sure we take the time to have a clear field of vision so we won't run into you.   If you got a ticket this morning, you can blame me. I called the cops on you and gave them your license plate number and description of your car. I told them which way you were headed. Yeah, that's right. I'm an interfering person who thinks that other people should be able to see where they are driving and obey the laws (in this town, driving with an obstructed view warrants a ticket). Too bad. Next time, maybe you will take a couple of minutes to clear those windows  before  you drive off. I don't care if you were late to work. Getting into an accident makes you late for work or worse. And, I saw you had a child in your car, in the front seat. It didn't look like your child was wearing a seat belt, but I couldn't be sure. In this state, it's illegal to have a child under the age of 12 ride in the front seat, and seat belts are required for front seat passengers. I believe they are required for children of that age and under, as well. Based on the school where you dropped your kid off, I'd say the chances are pretty good that your child is 12 or under. Lady, is it worth it?  (Done ranting for now)When I finished that last entry and tried to publish it, I got an error message. It was weird, like the computer problems followed me home.  Just  what I need...I meant to go to bed half an hour ago, but thought I might as well get this down before I forget all the exciting details. We had so many computer problems at work tonight (yes, it's really Wednesday morning, but I'm still up,so to me it's still Tuesday night). Dave finally restarted the pagination server, and things worked a little better after that, but the computers were still sluggish. I had a problem which started when I tried to move a file and it didn't quite work, then I had to close the program, and I couldn't log back in. At this same time, I was trying to PDF a page that hadn't gone right when I did it before. My Mac froze and I had to restart. There was about 20 minutes where I couldn't work on my pages at all, and I finished about 10 minutes after deadline. After deadline had passed, and I finished the last page, the computer started working a little better. I did a couple of comics pages for later this week, then started a Sunday Lifestyle page. I couldn't believe I have everything for that page except from one source. That page 2E for Sunday, where I put the crossword, Annie's Mailbox, and information from service organizations. I decided not to do everything tonight, but left at midnight, came home and played on the computer too long... again. So, good night.Long, boring, ranting, blogging, babbling, stream-of-consciousness, did I mention babbling?  Since it is after 2 a.m. Saturday morning, I will just refer to Friday as yesterday, even though I'm still up and it seems like the same day. I skipped my "Exploring the Visual Arts" class yesterday, but made it to my Photoshop class. I had to go to work right after class, because I had put my timesheet in my bag and took it home Thursday night instead of turning it in. Brilliant!   Some background information:  On January 22, 2003, I was driving Kent's car (the Escort) through the parking lot of Citizens Community Credit Union in Fort Dodge when a young woman (Haley) backed out of a parking space and ran into the car. I called the police, took the report to my insurance company, got two estimates and turned them in to the insurance company that same day. The following week, I got a letter from the young woman's insurance company (which I will name later if things continue in this manner) claims adjuster (Brad B.) saying that he was unable to contact me and I should call him. We have a post office box in Otho, where we live. When I got the mail that day, I sat in my car and called him right away, didn't even drive home. I gave him my side of the incident, and he said he would keep trying to get in touch with the girl. He mentioned she is 18 years old. He claimed that he was missing some information (damage estimate), so I got his fax number and had my insurance company fax the estimates to him.  Time passed. Around Feb. 5, my insurance company called to see what was going on. I called Brad B. and he said that Haley hadn't contacted him (big surprise), and he had to give her 15 days to get in touch. He said he would send a letter to her and if she didn't respond in 15 days, he would make a decision. I called this week, on Tuesday or Wednesday. He said he had to give Haley until Friday, then he would make a determination based on what he had if she didn't contact him.  He did not say he had not sent her a letter.  He said he would call me. Okay. When he didn't call, and I had to go to class, I called and left a message on his voicemail, saying he could call Kent and tell him what was going on. When I left class, there was a message on the cell phone from Kent, and he called while I was retrieving it. Apparently, Brad called Kent and told him that he had  not  sent the letter yet, he was going to send it, and had to give Haley 15 days. This is  another  15 days, in addition to the first 15 days we just went through. I called my insurance company and they are trying to contact Brad. Brad did not return their call before he left work Friday afternoon. Apparently, our next step is to contact his supervisor... then maybe file in small claims court.  This all makes me angry, which is why I'm posting this here. I won't give you the name of the insurance company which is avoiding paying a legitimate claim, unless I feel I have no choice. Is this any way to do business? She backed into me. It was clearly her fault. The damage is to the passenger door, rear panel, and bumper on the driver's side. Unless my car suddenly developed the ability to drive sideways, I could not have hit her. This girl refuses to contact her claims agent and he refuses to pay the claim. Would you really want to do business with a company that won't fulfill its contractual obligations? What if you had a claim your insurance should pay, such as a fire in your home - would you trust a company that won't pay out on claims?  You may say that the company has the right to make sure about the facts. That's true. But I think the fact that this girl refuses to return his calls speaks volumes. She must know this was her fault. Not getting in touch with the claims agent won't make this go away. Trust me, I'm not giving up on this one. If they think we will just say, "oh this is too much trouble, I'll let it pass," they are  sadly  mistaken. And, actually, Kent tells me that Brad told him that we should have  our  insurance pay the claim and then our insurance company can try to get the money from them. Yeah, right.  Wrong!    Now for legal purposes (meaning I don't want to get sued), I am not giving out last names, location of insurance companies, or the names of the companies involved. However, I may reconsider if this isn't resolved soon.   Okay, that takes me up to 3 p.m. Friday and there's a whole lot more... Kent left work early and met me at the parking lot at my work. He took the cell phone and went to pick up the girls from school. I went to work. I had to get as much done as possible, because I needed to leave for awhile to go to a film showing at The Blanden. The film was  Basquiat , about the life and art of Jean Michel Basquiat. I will write my "review" of it later, although I have a small start already. I think I can sum it up briefly by saying, that like drugs,  Basquiat  is a mood-altering experience. Why drugs? Because that was a huge part of his life and, ultimately, the end of it. When the film ended, I had to leave quickly, get something to eat and rush back to work. I had no transition from one thing to the other, and it was a shock.  Now, I'm exhausted, sitting here at the computer at nearly 3 a.m. My head is floating and feels too big for my neck. My mind was restless, but is growing numb. I would like to go to bed and watch tv, flipping through the channels until I fall asleep, but I can't. The tv in the bedroom is small and we lost the remote when we moved. I can never get the volume right - it's either too loud or too soft. Since I have to get up to change it, I usually don't. My to-do list for  today (!): work on project for Photoshop class, try to help Donna network her two computers, go to work. I'll be up too late at night again, and probably be too tired for church on Sunday. I'm going to bed now.Warning: long rant ahead  I thought I was going to have a stoke today. I was up too late again last night, as usual, so after taking the girls to school, I went home and took a nap. When I got up, I had time to eat, take a shower and get dressed for work, go to the pawn shop to pay interest, and get Kent lunch. Then I went to work. I got there about 12:30, which is normally plenty of time to do the two pages I do for the Sunday Lifestyle section. I do one page with "highlights" from various organizations, a couple of puzzles, and Annie's Mailbox. The other page is the Announcements: Anniversary, Birthday, Engagement, Wedding. Normally, Bill K. scans the photos for these. They are supposed to be done by Tuesday night, but he usually does them Wednesday night. I didn't work Tuesday, and Wednesday I just didn't notice that he wasn't there. I was pretty busy Wednesday night with five pages.  So, if I had known that Bill K. was ill, I could have (and would have) scanned those photos Wednesday night after the paper was put to bed and I was waiting to hear that all the pages were okay. Unfortunately, I missed out on that announcement, and although someone in the newsroom told a certain person that it "needs to be done," that certain person didn't realize the exact deadline, so they didn't get done. I realized this about 1 or 1:30 in the afternoon on Thursday, the day that I do the pages and they go to press. So, that left me with 15 photos to scan, which was totally unexpected. I was nearly having a panic attack. I have to leave work at 3 p.m. to pick my kids up and can't be back before 4. I was really freaking out, thinking about all the stress I was having because (apparently) this other person doesn't realize that if you don't get something done, it affects other people.  I got back to work at 4 and got the photos scanned, then started on Friday's paper. Finally, I could calm down. Part of the stress came from the fact that I missed a personal deadline of turning my timesheet in to the Student Success Center. I get paid to take notes and transcribe them for a student in my class. The deadline to turn timesheets in is the 20th of each month, and the check is sent on the 15th of the following month. So, now I won't get paid for my February hours until April. I  had  planned to turn my timesheet in after dropping the girls off and before heading back to work, but that plan died when I had to go back and scan the photos.   Part of my stress also stems from the fact that I think some things at work just plan don't work. There are three computers in the newsroom with Photoshop on them. Two are next to each other, one is at the desk next to mine. The person who was there quit, and I asked if that copy of Photoshop could be put on my computer instead. No go. I asked if a scanner could be put there. Also no go.  Picture this:  there are two computers in the old Pagination area that both have Photoshop. Another department got a new scanner, so their old one was put on the computer on the left, where there was already a scanner. The semi-new scanner is  under  the older scanner. You can't use two scanners at once, and if someone is on that computer, you can't scan at all. It doesn't make sense to me to see two scanners hooked up to one computer and someone's using it when I'm frantically going around trying to find a place to scan the darn photos!  It's unreal.  It didn't help that the person on that computer refused to move. Although I got back around 4, it was about half an hour before I could start doing the scans.  The rest of the evening seemed to go okay, except when I took my supper break. I wasn't watching where I was going, and my left arm was swinging a little and hit something hard. It hurts a little, mobility is slightly impaired by pain, and there's a definite bump. I'm going to see how it looks in the morning.  (Wait, it is morning - well, when I wake up, then.)  And, I should do laundry, but I think I can find something to wear... I hope... and the girls will just have to find some not-too-dirty socks... Good night.It's nearly 2 a.m., I haven't started on my project for my Advanced Photoshop class (because apparently I didn't really upload it to my Yahoo briefcase like I thought), and I'm watching "House Hunters" on  urlLink HGTV . This is a semi-interesting show... you get to see other people look at homes to buy. The couple in this episode (Alicia and Gentry Patrick) have my vote for "most overuse of the word   nice  "  It's starting to get annoying.  Tomorrow (actually later today) I have to turn in my days off request for March, my timesheet to the college for note-taking, and my timesheet at work. It's that time already. I was playing on  urlLink Neopets , but their server is down for maintenance (according to them), so I gave that up for now. Oh well, maybe I can get acquainted with sleep. That's always a good idea. When I was still at work, I had rebooted and took a bathroom break. While I was busy, my Mac came back on, but most of the desktop icons didn't appear. I rebooted again, and turned it off for awhile. David, our IT guy, had left while my Mac was rebooting the first time. I didn't feel there was any point in calling him in since he's scheduled to come back in at 8 a.m. So, I didn't get some things done that I usually get started on Wednesday night after the paper is put to bed.I added a "cast of characters" to my blog so people can figure out who the heck I'm talking about (that is, if anyone is reading this besides me...)  I went to Relief Society tonight. Jessica volunteered to help with the nursery again. I feel guilty about relying on her all the time, but it  does  get her out of the house. I gave her a scrapbooking book and templates that I had. It's nearly new, and the templates were only used once when Jessica was here watching the girls. Anyway, I  think  she likes it. And I do appreciate all the help she gives me.  Enrichment Night was about music - how it can help in many ways - bonding with family, growing spiritually, etc. Sister McCall read from her journal some thoughts about when she was young and her dad would play his guitar and sing her to sleep. It was really well-written. It wasn't the stream of consciousness type of journal like mine is. I didn't speak up during the lesson, but I was thinking of a lullaby I used to sing to the girls when they were babies. I had a little book called "Rock Rock My Baby" by Kay Chorao. I made up a tune to the words in the book and would sing it to the girls when they cried. They seemed to like it, or they went to sleep in self-defense. (Have you ever had your kid ask you to stop singing? Happened to me.) Anyway, little Peter Hill was fussing after the lesson and Jessica picked him up. He got fussier, so I stepped in. I held him and started singing that song... and soon realized I had forgotten most of the words! Well, Cayla is 7, so it's been a few years since I've sung it, but I still felt bad. I was reduced to humming the melody. Peter didn't seem to mind - he calmed down a little, as long as I kept humming that song. When I started singing another song (softly), he got fussy again, so Heather came over and took him back. Ah, well, my youngest child is 7 and it will be many, many years before I will be a grandmother, so I can either wait til then or keep my skills polished by keeping up with the infants at church. I like that second option better. I miss having a baby to hold.Hey! My  urlLink sister's  blogging now.I made a blog entry before I left for work, but when I tried to publish it, somehow it got lost in cyberspace...oh well. I have submitted to and been added to two web rings:  urlLink blogs by women  and  urlLink blogging mommies .   I guess this is all my little slice of fame. Somebody, somewhere might read this and think about me. Andy Warhol said that in the future everyone would be famous for 15 minutes, and this is my way of getting my 15 minutes.  I didn't have any problems going to work or coming home. The roads were still kind of messed up when I went to work, but nearly clear by the time I made it home. Well, the county road from 169 to Otho was pretty much covered, so I drove slowly (about 40-45) for that short distance. The streets in Otho are still pretty much covered in snow, but the drifts are gone. I wonder what Riverside Trail looks like. There's a road leaving Otho that goes zigzagging through trees. It is a pretty drive, but you really have to keep your eyes on the road. With snow on the road, it would be very hazardous. Well, we'll see tomorrow (later today) if I actually go to church.We're in the grip of a serious winter storm. It rained a good part of the day Friday before turning to snow. I don't think the snow has stopped. I left work at about 9:45 p.m. and took about 30 minutes to drive the 10 miles home. I was going about 25 mph most of the way. Highway 169 was nearly 100% snow- and ice-covered with drifts up to 1/2 foot, and visibility was less that 100 feet at times. That was nearly 4 hours ago, and it can only have gotten worse. I didn't see a snowplow on the way home. I could tell there had been one, but that it had been quite some time since it was there.  Kent is at work. Normally, he works 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. Monday through Friday, but he went in at midnight tonight in place of a guard who lives farther away than we do. At this point, we're just hoping the guy will be able to work tonight. I called Kent at work - he hasn't seen a snowplow yet.  We live in a mobile home and I'm wondering just how sturdy the roof is....I decided to add a link to my home page on the side and, in the process, thoroughly messed up the fonts. I'll see if I can fix them tonight. Sleep deprivation, while now my normal state, doesn't do me any good in the brain processing department. In other words, I'm stupid without sleep.  No comments from the peanut gallery!Well, I  nearly  got my wish today. I've been wishing for a snow day. You might think that most moms would be against a snow day, because it can be inconvenient to have the kids home when you have other plans. Well, my wish for a snow day is based on my need for  sleep . I've been wanting the opportunity to sleep in. I would have settled for a 2-hour delay, which would allow me an extra 2 hours of sleep, but today I just wanted the whole day free.  The brakes in Kent's car are going bad, so for the last week, I've been driving him to work, driving the kids to school, going home for a nap, going to school, going home again, driving back to town to pick the girls up from school, picking Kent up from work, then going to work. This only makes my bad habit of staying up way too late even more tiring. If school had just been cancelled today, I could have let Kent drive my car to work, then wait at home til he gets back, then go to work. Yes, even though it's raining now and will freeze and then it will snow tonight, I will still be going to work.   So, here's the day I wanted: Kent drives himself to work and the girls and I wait til he gets home, then I drive to work, for only 2 round trips and probably less than 50 miles total. (Well, I have to amend that, because he'll probably have to go back at midnight since the guard that comes in then lives even farther away from Fort Dodge than we do, so Kent will cover for him. So, less than 70 miles.) Here's the day I got: Drove Kent to work and the girls to school, went home for a nap, Kent called to tell me the schools were dismissing at 10:45, went to pick the girls up, went home... the rest of the day  should  go like this: Nap til 3, get ready for work, go pick Kent up from work, drive everyone home, go to work, come home, Kent drives to work at midnight, for about 100 miles and much, much less sleep. I better get started on that nap.Something I didn't notice til Wednesday - my car's mileage rolled over to 263,000 miles on Tuesday night. It must have been on my way home. I was so tired that night I wouldn't have noticed if confetti and balloons had dropped down. Some nights I'm so tired that I'm amazed I don't end up in a ditch. It wouldn't be so bad if we still lived in Fort Dodge and I only had a short distance, but Otho is about 10 miles away and it's 55 all the way there. I'm an accident waiting to happen.  Okay, I was thinking about what I wanted to say while I was driving home tonight...unfortunately, I have forgotten. Let me think. Oh, yeah... I was thinking about how vindictive I get while driving sometimes. Most of my way home is on Highway 169 as a four-lane, but a mile before the turn-off for Otho, it goes to two lanes. Even so, I expect oncoming drivers to  not  use their high-beam headlights when approaching, but the concept of courtesy to other drivers seems to be lacking in many people. Similarly, I get a little steamed at people behind me with their brights on. I love to let them pass me, and when they do, they are now in front and I will keep  my  high beams on just for them. I know it's petty, but maybe they'll learn a lesson. Maybe.  I used to (when I did my blogs at my web site) give each day's entry a title. I kind of like thinking of a theme for the day. I haven't implemented that on this one... yet. We'll see.  Catching up: Cayla lost a tooth on Feb. 5. She forgot to put her tooth under her pillow that night, so she didn't get her money until the next night, when she remembered. Then, she lost another tooth Friday morning (Feb. 7). We were getting ready for school, so I taped the tooth to the side of the fridge, thinking this is a good place for it - easily accessible, easy to see and not forget, not easily lost... oops. When we got home that afternoon, Cayla immediately went to the fridge, started to take the tooth off the fridge, and dropped it somewhere on the floor... maybe. I'm afraid it may be between the fridge and counter, in which case, the tooth fairy will stiff her on this one. If it's not under the pillow, she gets nothing. Just call me Mommy Meanie.Well, my art class (Exploring the Visual Arts) and other classes had the opportunity to visit the  urlLink Des Moines Art Center  yesterday. We went down in three 15-passenger vans, which Rusty Farrington said have been recalled or received safety warnings about high rollover rates. Great. The art center was interesting. The current exhibit, Magic Markers: Objects of Transformation, will run through April 20. It has a variety of styles and materials used by the various artists. I took notes about some of the things that really seemed interesting, but I'll put them on my web site, in my  urlLink notes for art class . On the way back, we ran into some rough weather - wind, rain and snow. I recalled what Rusty had said about the vans, and couldn't help feeling nervous, but we made it back okay. I'm glad I went, and I wish I could go on the next trip, but that one is to Minneapolis and will take all day, meeting at 6 a.m. and returning around 10 p.m. I just can't do that - I have kids to get to school and I'm scheduled to work that night. Oh, well. Right now, I'm getting ready for work, then I'll pick the girls up, pick up Kent, come home to drop them all off, and go to work. Ta-ta.Okay, okay, okay... obviously I didn't go right to bed like I said... but this is worth it.  urlLink Dave Barry's blog!I don't feel tired, exactly, but I don't feel like taking this little graphic heart blinkie apart right now. I checked it over and it still looks like it has some white outside the heart, which shows up against the black. The only problem is, when I checked each layer separately, I don't see any white. I'm not going to fix it tonight (nearly 3 a.m.). I have class in the middle of the day - 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Sometimes I come home after taking the girls to school, then take a nap for a couple of hours. Then I go to class, come back home and play around on the computer. Actually, I will need to update my notes from class. So, I really need to get my sleep. I'm too old for staying up all night.   I hate saying that. I don't feel old exactly. I like things that younger people like. I listen to top 40 songs just like I always did. I don't know... I have this theory that there is a defining time of your life... and you get stuck there. You don't progress with music, tv, prices of things, etc. You start saying things like, "in my day" and "when I was young." Well, I might say "when I was young" but I'm not saying it like an old person! I refuse to get stuck. I'm 42. I'm not a success. I don't make a lot of money, but I do love my job - most of it. But, like when I say, "I haven't decided what I'm going to be when I grow up," I really don't feel all that grown-up. I think I was born 20 years too soon. I like the things that are  now .  Enough philosophy and confusion. I'm going to bed.Well, I missed church again. I was up til 3:30 Sunday morning. It's now 2:40 Monday morning. See a trend here?  I did some blinkies yesterday afternoon. I think they are fun, but I hadn't done any for weeks. So, I did five. Four are the same shape, just different colors and stuff. One is heart-shaped. Shoot... I just remembered something that showed up when I put them on a black background... Back to the drawing board, so to speak...Tired, tired, tired. Was up til 3:30 a.m. again. Kent picked a fight with me this morning. The word "unreasonable" comes to mind... again. I'm heading to bed for a nap.Well, another day of time wasted. The weather was getting bad when I went to class, and when I got out (1 hour later), it was pretty bad. I went to pick the girls up. The schools were releasing early, but I was going to pick them up anyway. I didn't want to make another trip to town in the weather we were having. It was snowing and blowing heavily. Visibility was nearly 1/2 mile. Roads were slick. The scariest thing about all that is what are the other drivers doing. I did slide a couple of times but managed to keep control.   I've been playing too much Neopets again. The 3rd of the month is half price day at the shops, so I've been trying to stock up on stuff. Unfortunately, nothing was available for most of the day. I finally got something to show up just before Kent got home. He took over the computer and gave it back around 10.    I need to type up my notes for art class. Apparently, I have been doing too much. The person for whom the notes are intended doesn't want all the stuff I've been doing. She just wants the important parts. I kind of thought it was all important, but I'll cut it down to size. Maybe she'll say it's not enough next time. Oh, well... I just have to do it, I will get paid. That's the thing that keeps me going in the face of underappreciation.The following material is just something that used to be part of my aim profile section called "My Opinions" ..new material for today will be posted..keep the questions coming.   "Our Society" Once upon a time, people believed in respect, marriages were forever, and people actually gave a shit about life in general...that is until about 40 and some odd years ago when our parents were born.  Their generation helped fuck up our generation. Perhaps it was the drugs, perhaps it was the fact that their parents sucked, maybe they wanted to be rebels, who knows?? But I think everyone in my generation will agree that it was our parents who caused our generation to plummet into a moral and ethical downward spiral, as well as making life even harder than it is.  The concept of morality and good in our society is diminishing and maybe thats just party of  some sort of plan?  If you think about it, all of history has been a big wave as far as anything is concerned, and i believe that right now life is reaching the peak of carelessness.  People are becoming more selfish,  less responsible, and not focused enough on whats important; everyone is becoming so focused on "living life to its fullest" that they lose focus on the importance and value of certain things in life.  People take the concept of living life to the fullest, and abusing it.  Sooner or later though,  someone somewhere is going to wake these people up who are living in their dream worlds and bring them back to reality.  Someone HAS to start teaching our generation to make "right" what our parents made "wrong" in our lives...if that doesnt happen, the next generation is going to have to put up with the mistakes our parents made as well as our own, and their lives are going to suck double fold!..remember, only YOU can prevent forrest fires!  "Smoking weed." I know alot of people that bitch at people for smoking marijuana, when really they should be bitching at the people who smoke cigarettes. Weed is a gateway drug, true, but only to the weak. You can probably call Tobacco a gateway drug because people get used to smoking something..they indulge in tobacco, so why not the weed right? Those who smoke cigars already have half of the necessary ingredients to "roll a blunt", so why not get the other half? Everything in life has BAD effects, but people usually ignore the effects in favor of the good results...think about it..You see commercials now for medicine..lets generically call it Med-X. Bla bla bla Med-X has been known to alleviate menstrual cramps in frogs under the age of 20. Med-X is not for everyone. {lower sneaky voice} Med-X in most cases has cause side effects such as deterioration of the liver, anal bleeding, and migraines. Now..if i'm a frog under 20 who has severe menstrual pains, i'm probably going to take that Med-X to get rid of the pain..and ignore the side effects. Call me biased, whatever, but smoking tobacco products has far worse side effects than weed. Plus tobacco products are more accessible than weed, they are legal, and cheaper. People smoke them because they can. You dont get a high or anything from tobacco products...so what the fuck are the benefits? Why smoke them? If youre going to fuck up your lungs why not fuck them up and get something out of the deal. Smoking ciggarettes is like drinking a non alcoholic beer thats high in saturated fat, cholesterol, and carbohydrates..why would you drink that..i mean youre not going to get drunk..just fatter, right? You wouldnt. So whats the point of this opinion that i spouted out about for a good paragraph or so. There is none. Who cares who smokes what unless you dont like either type of smoke.Note: these questions are legit..not made up by me..someone actually wants me to ask them... Question from a male friend of mine  Question:what do i do if muy ex girlfriend wont get over me and stop being anal???  Answer:Obviously your Ex hasn't read todays post about men, women and stuff   Question:but  how bout how do i get the ex o stop fuckin text messaging me????

Enigma-"Return to Innocence" Don't be afraid to be weak Don't be too proud to be strong Just look into your heart my friend That will be the return to yourself The return to innocence. If you want, then start to laugh If you must, then start to cry Be yourself don't hide Just believe in destiny. Don't care what people say Just follow your own way Don't give up and use the chance To return to innocence. That's not the beginning of the end That's the return to yourself The return to innocence. aslo..if you have something you'd like  me to write about, as i said earlier, email me...jms504@juno.com urlLinkIn case i ever run out of things to write about, i'd like you, my fans..lol to email me questions that i could publically answer...about maybe problems your having in life. Something that would be useful for people who look at this page to read responses to. If need be i'll keep your name private and withheld...just like an advice column sort of thing. Later asshousesWell well well such a heated subject these days, since nearly everyone has an "asshole boyfriend" , a "bitch girlfriend", is single because they cant take it anymore, or they just cant find "THE ONE"..relationships ahh yes, its all fun and games till someone loses an eye, or has their ego hurt.  I've seen or have been in nearly every category of relationship...I'm old..and wise... All men are assholes, or psycho, or possesive. All women are bitches, or crazy, or clingy. FACE THE FACTS PEOPLE...no one is perfect... You never will find someone that is perfect, but rather you should be trying to find someone perfect for you...aka YOUR TYPE.. The trick here is..look at yourself..figure out whats wrong with you, because people, we're humans, find out what your biggest relationship flaw is, face the facts, talk to the exes..talk to your friends that are bluntly honest with you.. WHATS WRONG WITH YOU...if anyone says.."nothing" theyre nothing but lying ass kissers...theres something wrong with every one of us.  Now once you've swallowed your pride you should first seek a PERSONALITY in a person of the opposite sex that seems to match with your flaws..using the above flaws as an example...possessive guys and clingy girls are a good match, whereas an independant guy and an independant girl are sure to fail.. Now GIRLS AND GUYS, we all know that looks are a major factor..but personality FIRST...find compatability, then look at what thet look like..theres nothing wrong with having physical taste...some guys are breast men, some girls like really big dicks, whatever...All of us, both guys and girls have their tastes, don't deny it. You have to get to really know the person as well, figure out what you like about the other person, but more importantly what you DISLIKE about the person...if what pisses you off about him/her isnt that big of a deal where you can blow it off and it not be a major emotional trauma for you, youre in good shape! Otherwise, fuck it..you can try and try and try and it will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever (takes breath) ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever... work..if it doesnt work with someone, its not a crime, youre JUST INCOMPATIBLE, get over it...move on  I've been in this spot before, and IT SUCKS, but suck it up, life goes on.. Remeber, this life is YOUR life, and you DESERVE to be happy. If youre not with someone who will make you happy, dont start all that whiny self esteem shit, just get over it. You will find someone in time...that is if you stop concentrating on the one person you arent going to work with.  Relationship people, the key is COMPATABILITY, embed that in your skulls..COMPATABILITY...you need to be paired with someone who you can deal with PERIOD.  Ooo and onto the single people...yeah the single life is fun...some girls/guys like being players, some girls/guys like being single, some girls/guys are afraid of being hurt, well join the fucking rest of the world. If someone comes along and you feel you are COMPATABLE with them, fuck it, take a shot, whats there to lose at most, a few months?? wow..big fucking deal..you have roughly 960 months in a life time, you have a few to spare..remember relationships provide somethings the single life cant, and NO NOT SOMEONE TO DO ALL THE TIME..well yeah..thats a given but..good relationships provide a feeling that you cant ever ever ever recreate with anything else...some call it LOVE...ya know..that thing you tell that guy/girl so they will do you? yeah well when it REALLY happens, you'll know it. And also, you single fucks(this includes me), DONT LOOK FOR SOMEONE...you pathetic fucks, the more desperate you look, the worse off you are..yeah..SOMETIMES it gets lonely, but thats life...stop thinking the grass is greener on the other side..and don't rush into anything..be you and enjoy life  Guys/Girls its a rough world...someone somewhere will like you for you, its your life...Remember:compatablity is key to happiness in relationships...if youre single..living life for the sake of living is key. REMEMBER: ITS YOUR LIFE..YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY, live it up mother fuckers..and read this Bon Jovi - It's My Life  This ain't a song for the broken-hearted  No silent prayer for the faith-departed  I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd  You're gonna hear my voice  When I shout it out loud   Chorus:  It's my life  It's now or never  I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just wanna live while I'm alive  It's my life   This is for the ones who stood their ground  For Tommy and Gina who never backed down  Tomorrow's getting harder make no mistake  Luck ain't even lucky  Got to make your own breaks   Chorus:  It's my life  And it's now or never  I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive  'Cause it's my life   Better stand tall when they're calling you out  Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down   Chorus:  It's my life  And it's now or never  'Cause I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive   Chorus:  It's my life  And it's now or never  'Cause I ain't gonna live forever  I just want to live while I'm alive  (It's my life)  My heart is like an open highway  Like Frankie said  I did it my way  I just want to live while I'm alive  'Cause it's my life!"So the good boys and girls take the so called right track Faded white hats Grabbing credits Maybe transfers They read all the books but they can't find the answers And all of our parents They're getting older I wonder if they've wished for anything better While in their memories Tiny tragedies  They love to tell you Stay inside the lines But something's better On the other side  I wanna run through the halls of my high school I wanna scream at the Top of my lungs I just found out there's no such thing as the real world Just a lie you got to rise above  I am invincible As long as I'm alive"  So here I am staring at my computer screen talking to Cleopatra and Adrienne, with my winamp on...and John Mayer..no such thing comes on. "I just found out there's no such thing as the real world Just a lie you got to rise above", Mayer sings...what does that have to do with me you wonder. Well In my last post I believe i touched on the idea i sort of have that my life isnt real at all, that its just a movie.. Well have you ever thought that perhaps what you thought was the real world was nothing but a generically created atmosphere that you've been drawn into thinking is real because you've been part of it for so long? Sometimes i wonder...here's why: It seems that my life follows certain patterns for certain things, like when someone does something bad to me, something bad happens to them shortly after automaticallyl; something i'm not the cause of. If you were the movie producer and I was a character in your movie, wouldn't the viewers love for things to be bittersweet, ya know, in america, somehow the good guy always wins? Yeah.. Ever drive under a street light and have it turn off and on??? Well become me, then you'll notice it more often, since it happens too much? Oh and of course theres me being psychic. Now at first read all you fuckers will smirk at that, as if its a joke..due to what you see on TV. Well you are part right in doing that, since what you see on TV is a JOKE..its to make money, its bullshit. I have proof, people will vouch for things i've predicted.  It's not like i look into a fucking crystal ball and see things will happen, but things come to me in a variety of ways.. First, sometimes i Do  see things..those types of predicitons come to me in the form of imagination almost.  Picture yourself dazing off into space in class. Well at times i've "dazed off" and then just random things filled my head, some of which WERE just imaginations, but others have come true. I've told people when i've seen things.. i usually tell one person to be safe just so that if it DOES happen, i have someone to vouch for me.  The other form the predictions come in is kinda weird to understand.  I'll just be talking, and something random will come out, something not part of my concious thoughts; and it will happen out of nowhere. There is no set time when i get either type of prediction coming to me, i can't turn it on and off, and normally i cant tell the difference between the first type of prediction i have and imagination unless it really comes true. Messed up huh? Well yeah, pretty much but go ahead and tell the people who have been witness to this shit that its a lie or i'm nuts(ok well i AM nuts but thats besides the point).  Anyway...sometimes i joke about me being able to read ahead in the script, that is, the script of life..as if the "Director" has allowed me to do so...there are some things I JUST KNOW and I don't know why I know them.  Perhaps there is a director...  Whether life is a movie or something else, theres a chance that its not real, bottom line and I like exploring that idea. "So the good boys and girls take the so called right track Faded white hats Grabbing credits Maybe transfers They read all the books but they can't find the answers"  Well if life isnt real, then think about it, theres no right or wrong answers, everything just changes based on your choice. Usually when things don't turn out right, people usually refer to have made a mistake, but thats only because of the result. Had something good happened, its most likely because of the end result. If thats the case, why do i spend my time worrying about being good and doing the right thing...who the fuck says anything is the right thing...it may all be relative to the individual..is there really an absolute? Also, people spend their whole life looking for answers, asking why why why to everything that happens. But why ask why..it happened and theres nothing you can do. Is there really an answer at all? Why look for one? FUCK IT "They love to tell you Stay inside the lines But something's better On the other side" thats right..there is something waiting for you on the other side, who can say if its better, or worse,but you have to take chances, seek what you do not know..ALWAYS take the chance, you can't lose something you don't have. "I am invincible As long as I'm alive" Everything in the world has a gain and a loss.  As long as you have your life, nothing can take it away except death. Don't live for death, live while youre alive..live for the sake of living.  Ok enough about life being a movie and all that..though i try my best to think that life isnt real, sometimes things happen to make it feel so real. It sucks alot because it seems like my "real life" problems are more complicated than anyone elses.  I usually have no problem solving anyone elses problems through advice and stuff, but no one ever has answers for me.. i'm fucking superman..gotta be the leader, wear a smile and not let whats bothering me really affect me, but sometimes even everyone's hero runs into something equivalent to kryptonite...sometimes i'm weak(though i dont usually show or admit it) and i need some help, but no one can usually help this hero. I'm usually stuck picking my self back up and continuing off and being a superhero to someone else.  Its a good thing i'm a strong person, who else will save the world? lol I'm sure some payoff will come for me..where i'll get mine..and until that day comes, i'll do my best to stay as sane as possible.   For right now i'm done talking about stuff, maybe i'll have more to write later, but until then.... umm cant think... fuck itWord/Phrase of the moment: "Asshouse"  Can be a noun-Shut up, you asshouse. Thats a great asshouse.  If it was up your asshouse you'd know it. Verb-  quit asshousing around and lets go.   Adjective-I'm sick of this asshouse food. Prounoun.  I was just talking to bob.  Asshouse said he is gay.  any use of this word must be followed by giving proper credit to R theodore lopez for its creation or legal action may ensue, you ASSHOUSE!Ahh yes, welcome to the odd and semi wonderful world of my life. For years now, I've been almost convinced that my life is a movie. So much happens in it that makes life seem all too unreal. If you sit and think about it, its amazing how so many tiny little things come together just for one small thing to happen.  It must be nice not to sit and think deeply about anything, to be simple and free of any sort of complication. I find myself quite often being cursed with having a brain...and it SUCKS!!  ahh yes...a journal..something to read..somewhere to post my happiness, anguish, and other sorts of feelings...This probably won't be just used to piss and moan publically about my life like alot of people's journals(now don't get upset peoples, the truth is the truth), though i'm sure i'll do my fair share of that,lol.  This will be used to jot down some memories i'd like to be able to look back on as well.  This is my time capsule so to speak. My life has been full of many interesting twists and turns ever since i've become a socially functioning human being. I've been through everything from the death of a friend to the death of a 4 year relationship on the bad side, and Being a pro wreslter to joining a Fraternity on the good side. Point here being i've concluded that in life there is no win or lose, it all evens out in the end...for every good there is a bad, for every win there is a loss, ..blah blah you get the point.  I don't think anyone has had it easy in life, and if you have, good for you, don't take advantage of it, appreciate it. My life has been kind of rough growing up.  In my younger childhood I dealt with an incompetent and irresponsible father (that i still have to deal with to this day) and my mother who was generally ass backwards, most of the time nuts, and not really there.  They had a way of never being there emotionally when I needed them to be. In school I wasnt much of a social person(for some reason i felt excluded and isolated from everyone else most of the time). If you combine those two things you have a hell of a brickwall to climb when youre growing up. Now somehow, I'm here...i've made it..alive at least..and sometimes well.  There are still alot of battle scars left over though, and here and there they poke through. I find myself at times struggling with life, and having difficulties with it that come as a result of my upbringing.  It took me a long long time to realize that I indeed do have some issues, and then even longer to do something about fixing them.  But here I am now, nearly 23 years old. I've made so much progress, through self help, through the advice of others, etc..Now that just made it sound like I have a terminal illness or something, but thats not it, its more of a curse.  You see, i'm different, and a big cause of my struggle with life is accepting difference, as my mother would often ridicule anything and everything she considered "different"(like putting clothes in a dryer).    yeah yeah..cry cry cry..  anyway...here i am, sophmore/junior in college, 22 years old. I should be out in the working world, and starting to get serious about being on my own..but instead here I am, in the sucky poconos.  There's a backstory that goes along with college and maybe it will be theraputic to me so i'm going to type it.  The setting is the years 1996/1997..I have aspiring dreams to be a pro wrestler, and I love watching ECW; the atmosphere is so intense.  I work at mcdonalds, and its a shitty job, really stressful, but is money and mom gets off my back some now that i'm working.  I'm the computer nerd of the family, as i spend a good portion of my day sitting online, talking to people, and just playing with the computer in general. Everyone in the family says I should go to school for computers since I'm good at it, so why not?  Apply to Penn State Main campus,and I think Wilkes and another school which is escaping me at the moment.  I'm not the best student in school but overall i end up with a 97.something overall average and will graduate 17th in my class....SAT scores first time around 1175 and had no ambition to take them again.  I've been in the gifted program since 1st grade at old forge.  I've gone to old forge elementary and old forge high school(which is the same building), the only "one town, one school" school district in NEPA besides dunmore.  My family is lower-middle class, we have a simple house. Dad's always working..on the road, at this time i think he's in insurance or home improvement, and mom works at either boscovs or sam's club. I have a little sister, 9 years younger than me.  We live in a simple house, nothing fancy and hell i have no real idea of what anything fancy really is, clothes, or other.  In School, i'm pretty much unknown, I talk to a few people here and there but not enough for it to count. I'm pretty much the quiet kid, i'm an observer of everyone with a life and if i wanted to be any more than that, I wouldnt know how because who do i have to learn from. I've always been somewhat shy and some even say "backward"..at this point i look 4 years younger than i am.  I dont know the difference between clothes from K mart and clothes from Structure, just because I was happy with just having stuff to wear.  Generally if you see me, I have the same haircut i;ve had for years, a really bad side part comb over, its really really lame, I wear tapered blue jeans, usually arizona brand from JC penny's, and a champion brand shirt, and the only shoes i will wear are Nikes and not because theyre a brand name, its because they are the only ones that felt like they fit comfortably.  At this point I dont think much of myself, because frankly no one else does...none of my peers give a shit about me. My friend since kindergarten, Chris, has been in a 'serious' relationship now for maybe a year or 2 and has a habit of screwing me over for his g/f quite often, and anyway i have no real life, I dont go out, i don't do anything.  I have another friend named peter but he's in the same boat as i am. My closest friend right now would have to be my cousin pat.  I hang with pat and watch and play football for fun, though hanging out with him is usually stressful for me all in itself because my mother seems to have something against that side of the family(guilt trips for spending any time with that side of the family ). So there i am, nothing to no one, and along comes a girl out of nowhere.  All of a sudden, this nobody starts to get attention from girls, and not that i havent had any girlfriends prior to this, but i've been in a slump for quite long enough.  The attention came after I joined stage crew for a play upon suggestion of peter's brother rob and some talking to chris about the girls IN the play. So..thus starts my first real relationship.  Her name was first brought up by my friend chris as being an airhead, but there was just something about that airhead that caught my eye.  Suprisingly, she wasnt the only girl in her class that had her eye on me, but all my attention went her way.  (How that relationship ended up is a long story in itself, but we're on the subject of school)..I fell in love with heather and she became the sole focus and care of my life as i really had nothing else.  She loved the shy goofy kid who looked like he shopped at kmart for clothes(and did), who wasnt anything to anyone in that school, who no one gave 2 shits about; she gave him her heart, and he gave her his.  I was in love for the first time, and for the first time i felt like i was somebody..and so what if i was just somebody to one person, thats all that mattered.  Heather and I were very different(and if  you read the above description about how my mother instilled how to handle difference into me, you'll probably be able to guess how it ended up) but we seemed to get along allright at this point.  I cant exactly remember how things were working out in the early stages of the relationship, but i think they were pretty good considering we were both just "kids".  Heather was always there for me, and though i was often embarassed about my mom being such a f-ing nutcase, she was there for me.  When it came time to decide where to go to school, somewhere along the line, a fight ensued between me and my mother(which wasnt uncommon, hell at least one a day), which ended in "I don't care if you work at McDonalds the rest of your life". gee thanks mom for the encouragement.  Well i did decide to go to school despite my mothers excessive pessimism, and chose to go to Penn State..Penn State scranton, that is.  I had to choice to go to main campus but i was paranoid about losing heather if I went away, so i stayed home..  I went there for 2 years, and in that 2 years time, i continued to work at mcdonalds, Heather worked at Mineo's pies, and things seemed to be going fine at home.  I finally got some balls, stood up to my mom and didnt speak to her for over 6 months, didnt rely on her for anything at all...i started to separate myself from her negative influences...notice I don't mention my dad much, he was never around, and when he was, he was my moms puppet.  Heather and i at this point were constantly on the rocks, and that seemed to be the only thing going REALLY wrong.  All the shit my mother put me through seemed to seep out in this time as I was probably one of the biggest A-hole psycho boyfriends you can possibly be...i wont go into details, i've had to face my mistakes enough as it is, but hell use your imagination and it probably happened.  Anyway, i had some new friends and we collectively called ourselves the Kommunity Kult...bad bad name and we had fun getting drunk and pissing off all the cool people...we were just a group of nobodies but as a group we made ourself somebodies. the year 2000  is when the hardship really came around.  My dad decided that he didnt like my mom anymore and got a g/f only 2 years older than me. Heather graduated high school, and at this point the tie that bound heather and I together was as strong as bubble gum.  The situation with my father worsened problems with Heather and I, as I began to question if i REALLY loved her.  I began to live in a world of doubt because the only thing i was sure that would always be in my life besides heather, my family, was exploding apart. I witnessed things go to shambles firsthand. I quit mcdonalds because my father had a new job at PA resources and was on the road to making over 100 grand a year, so he told me just to concentrate on school and don't worry about working.  So i Quit. PSU was about done with me so i transferred to the U of scranton to continue my studies. Not working didnt work out so well as when dad left, the money slowly stopped, dad didnt make much money as he accepted a lesser position.  Heather and I blew up totally, this along with dealing with all that goes with mom and day splitting, problems with friends, i didnt do as well as i should have at the UofS. Eventually the credit cards I had...which up until this point i was able to handle, started to get unbearable, since i didnt have a job and had no money coming in, the credit card+the mac machine was the only way to get any cash for food, gas, car payment, etc.  I had to get a job, and heather and I worked at PA resources doing telemarketing. My father hit a slump and though he had his young fuck buddy, he went downhill, when he needed money he'd come to me, who didnt have much to begin with.  Hey john, i need to ask you a favor, can i borrow your discover platinum..i need a few bucks, i'll pay ya back...sure dad....  eventually the bills got so much that paying them became the focus of my life.  I eventually stopped going to school after just 2 semesters at the U, heather and I had broken up, my life had hit rock bottom. I reconciled with my mother finally for all the insanity she had caused in my life, she apologized, and she was on medication now to help her out.  I cashed in some old mutual funds to pay off some credit card bills, but that eventually went to shit as dad needed more money to buy and fix a house and the payments got too much for me.  It was time to start scraping my ass up off the concrete after life had run me right over and start from scratch.. I didnt know who i was, as the only thing that made me me was heather, i didnt have money, i stopped going to school, no money, nothing...i was a failure...  Today December 2,2k2...Dad got his g/f pregnant, she should have the child in a few days, mom is struggling to keep the house and provide for my sister, i have HORRIBLE credit as there was no attempt made by DAD to pay off anything really, and fuck, where the hell am i going to make enough money to put a dent in like 50 grand of debt?? But there is a positive, i'm starting to finally find my niche in life and who i am. I'm a very blunt person, i like to say i'm an asshole sometimes cuz hell its true.  I love my families, i'm a very giving person, and what I want out of life is to get my feet firmly planted.  I want to be in a position where i'm not struggling anymore...i managed to get back in school, here at esu. I've advanced leaps and bounds socially..i actually go out, i worry what i look like, and damnit some people like me..people think i'm attractive now and though at times its hard to handle the attention its much appreciated.  I have a few good friends that i consider family and a diverse range of other friends as well.  I'm going to finish college in around 3 semesters which i'm looking forward to. My dad, still an ass...promised to help me go to school he'd pay for my car payment..and well...this one is almost a month overdue so i had to pay for it with christmas money my grandmother gave me to pick out clothes or things i need from her.  Next one is due in 9 days, yet he doesnt seem to show a bit of care.  I'm managing life pretty well emotionaly, but there are times where i just want to give up...i still find myself doing some things like my nutty mother used to.... but i'm doing my best to manage.  I feel like i'm too much for anyone to handle and put up with, because i'm so complicated, so deep and so different.  I've had alot of life experience so far, and i like to help people out, its like a hobby or something, but when it comes to helping myself out, its really hard because i'm so emotional.   This post has taken forever to write, i think i need a break...but hey..thanks for reading..who knows what will be in the next episode of my life...who knows...who cares? Hopefully by now..someone does~!  PS..this isnt meant to cry really, its just to kinda let you all know about some things in my life thus far... Goodbye  "I'm just a dreamer, I dream my life away... I'm just a dreamer, who dreams of better days"-OzzyI got this nice email the other day forwarded from my best female friend eeever, heather.. Read this stuff, its heart warming, and since its the holiday season and all...i know its a depressing time for some, me included..read this {most is taken word for word from the email, anything with an * by it has been added} FACTS OF LIFE 1.At least 5 people in this work love you so much they would die for you. 2.At least 15 people in this world love you in some way. 3.The only reason anyone would ever hate you is because they want to be just like you. 4.A smile from you can bring happiness to anyone, even if they don't like you. 5.Every night, SOMEONE thinks about you before they go to sleep. 6.You mean the world to SOMEONE. 7.Without you, someone may not be living. 8.You are special and unique in your own way. 9.Someone you don't even know exists loves you. 10.When you make the BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER, something good comes from it. 11.When you think the world has turned its back on you, take a look, because you most likely turned your back on the world. 12.When you think you have no chance at getting what you want, you won't get it. BUT, if you believe in yourself, you will get it sooner or later. 13.Always remember complements you have received, forget about the rude remarks. Everyone says bad things about other people, so when you hear something good from someone take it to heart*. 14.Always tell someone how you feel, then they will know. 15.If you have a truly great friend, take the time to let them know that they are great.Hmm...havent written in a little while....finals AND SHIT to worry about... Here's a few tips to help be successfull in life.  This isnt the complete advice article on how to be successful, since i havent totally determined EVERY variable that brings about success. Perhaps success isnt totally in our control anyway, perhaps there has to be some "outside help" to success. Just think about the last thing that happened in your life..successful or otherwise. THink about how many tiny little minute things had to happen preceding the event up until the very moment that the event actually happened.  Think about how if just one of those things was out of place it could have caused the event to not happen at all.  It makes you wonder if any facet of this life was preplanned...  Anyway here's 2 tips for you..some good advice ..some i've heard and some i've come up with myself:  Don't take NO for an answer. There is no reason in life why you cant get exactly what you want.  First, dont ask questions, rather use statements.  That way someone is less likely to respond in a negative manner.  In this case you have to be careful not to sound like a dictator. Most of the time when people tell you NO, they dont have a good reason, or the reason they have isnt as good as they think.  Don't give up until NO becomes YES. If you want something...go and get it. Don't let anything get in your way, especially some jackass telling you NO.  Don't try to do everything on your own...delegate responsibility.(thanks to Matt "Chester" Phelan for sparking the thoughts on this one) This one is officially useful for you leader types out there like me.  Many times people end up pulling their hair out because they have so much to do and so little time. The great part of having friends and family is that they can help you out if you need it.  Most of the time, people will be happy to help you out since it seems that everyone is almost always bored. You must be wise in choosing who help you in doing what.  For example if you needed someone to pick up certain alcohol for a party, it would be useless to assign the job to someone under the age of 21...it would also be useless to ask someone who has 3 brain cells to do it because chances are they won't be able to get the job done correctly..so maybe you can have the person that is under 21 pick up the munchies for this party and the other dumbass can fget the babes for the  party because usually really dumb people are good at people skills. The point here isn't how to throw a good party, its how to find the right people help you on the road to success. Befriend a computer dork, a grease monkey, a mafia hitman, a chef, a nightclub bouncer, a bartender, etc etc... People like to feel useful...make them feel useful...think about it, people become things so they can be used for those things...we are life whores~!  Remember kids...if you want me to write about a certain topic, or respond to any questions, either im them to me JMS504 or email..jms504@juno.comMore posts coming soon, but for now just a song for some people to fucking think about.  My child arrived just the other day  Came to the world in the usual way  But there were planes to catch and bills to pay  He learned to walk while I was away  He was talkin' 'fore I knew it  And as he grew he said,  'I'm gonna be like you, Dad,  You know I'm gonna be like you.'   Chorus  And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon,  Little boy blue and the man 'n the moon.  'When you comin' home?'  'Son, I don't know when. We'll get together then.  You know we'll have a good time then.'   Well, my son turned ten just the other day.  He said, 'Thanks for the ball, Dad. Come on, let's play.  Could you teach me to throw?'  I said, 'Not today. I got a lot to do.'  He said, 'That's okay.' And he walked away and he smiled and he said,  'You know, I'm gonna be like him, yeah.  You know I'm gonna be like him.'   Chorus   Well, he came from college just the other day,  So much like a man I just had to say,  'I'm proud of you. Could you sit for a while?'  He shook his head and he said with a smile,  'What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys.  See you later. Can I have them please ?'   Chorus   I've long since retired, my son's moved away.  I called him up just the other day.  'I'd like to see you, if you don't mind.'  He said, 'I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time.  You see my new job's a hassle and the kids have the flu,  But it's sure nice talkin' to you, Dad.  It's been sure nice talkin' to you.'  And as I hung up the phone it occurred to me,  He'd grown up just like me.  My boy was just like me.Well its been forver and a day since i've posted anything.  Over break I got absorbed in the whole being lazy thing.  However, break is over now..so its back to the books, beer and babes.  Ahh yes..college life. Today is superbowl sunday, and I believe i forgot to give a shit or something.  I used to be big into football. I followed the Dallas Cowboys religiously..and NO I didnt "jump on the bandwagon". I liked them before they started to win their 5,287 championships.  Now I don't really want to waste my younger years away in front of the TV. When i'm old and out of college and working a real job, I can see myself getting back into it all.  Right now i'm too into "living life" and all that to put watching football at the top of my list of priorities. And Oh ya...i'm 23 now...gotta use it before i lose it.  Now back to deep thinking and things of that nature.  Its about that time fellow humans...and NO i'm NOT talking about the superbowl...NO i'm not talking about someones "time of the month" and NO i'm not talking about lunch...The time when all the animals come out to play..with each other.. The dawn of mating season for all of the creatures is about to begin..soon it will be upon us, and when the dawn breaks,  walking five feet without seeing 2 rabbits making sweet bunny love will become a rarity.  Mating season is something that applies to all animals, not just the furry ones(shut it and shave it)...we humans are about to kick into the mode where we have to prep ourselves to look the best we can for the opposite sex.  People who havent set foot on a treadmill will begin running like it's their job.  In the winter, we cover up as much skin as possible, and during mating season, we show as much skin as possible without getting arrested. It's a time to do whatever it takes to make yourself a theoretical marketing success...you want to be a hot product, that EVERYONE wants to buy. Time to SELL away. Now that sort of sounds pretty bad, whorish and cheap, but thats how we are created, that's our nature, that is nature.  There are just some facts of life that we cant deny at all..they are built in.. Nature says that all creatures will have the obligation to mate..thats right people...all creatures...male rabbits need to mate just as much as female ones.. The question is though...what kind of mate does each of us want?  Not every creature is looking for the same kind of creature...there are many different things that are taken into consideration when deciding if we want to mate with someone or not.. First there are a few categories of the type of mate we want.  Some rabbits are looking for rabbits they can have a long term rabbit thing with..while other rabbits are looking for a one time rabbit fuckfest.  Now of course as nature would have it, girl rabbits are more prone to be looking for the long term rabbit thing, but that is not always the case..there are alot of girls who just love good sex...and bad sex..just sex in general.. Anyway, finding the perfect mate for yourself is never an easy task, unless you're lucky and get a royal flush on the first deal.  But most of us have horrible horrible luck. If i knew a statistician, I think i would make a webpage that helped you figure out the chance of you finding YOUR perfect mate. You would type in things about your life via a survey type interface(ooo lets get all techinical), and then things about your ideal mate...then on the server side of the web page..a trained statistics monkey would figure out the probability that you will find your ideal mate, and then send it back to the user..who in turn will look at the screen and say..."Fuck...I guess it's time to move to cali."   It's common knowledge that finding someone who is perfect for you is nearly impossible.  All rabbits have a predetermined idea of what their perfect mate is like.  Since most of us know we don't have a snowball's chance in hell of actually finding that person, we have some thinking to do(or you can just not think and do everything of or resembling the opposite sex). In this time before the main event, mating season 2003, begins we must figure out what areas of our idea of the perfect mate we're willing to do without.  Perhaps a girl with a mustache ISNT THAT BAD...ok no wait...I take that back. This is the time us humans should think about things like this..because we can. Those dumb fucking rabbits can't think to this capacity..so they just mate with whatever...and their buddies don't bust their balls for doing that really really freaky chick with the messed up ear.  Think about what you want..what is necessary in your perfect mate(long or short term, or once and say goodbye term, whatever your flavor is) and what is not.  People who are too idealistic will be stuck with no mate and a sticky hand..while people who have no ideals will not only be laughed at by friends and non friends alike for what they did last night, but they will also kill of any bit of self esteem they may have, contract some fun diseases, and live a life of regret and shame(and really what fun is that?).  So rabbits, get your brains in gear...think some..guys,use your bigger head(hopefully) before your little head leads you to rosie o'donnel, and girls go ahead and do that guy that looks like gilbert gottfried..so i can LAUGH at you and tell you to come back and read this next year because the damage is done already.  Think before you pink.  Peace Love and happy fucking. The man, The myth, the mother fucking legend, MeHellllllllllllllllllllo... I was getting ready to write a nice long post about "Pride" but i'm not so sure now I have all my ideas on the subject totally gathered and organized but I am going to give it a shot, then go off and ramble about something else that may happen to come to mind.  Pride.. You're a football player, you're proud to have made the team. You're rich, you're proud of your nice car and your armani suits. You're a midget, you're proud that if you move to chicago, you dont have to breate in as much smog as the "taller people." You're stupid, you're proud to be polish.  Pride is something everyone.  It comes in many shapes, colors, flavors, with whip cream, underneath your clothes, inside, outside and everything in between.  If youre proud of something...great...many people work hard for many things, and when you finally reach a desired outcome.  Reaching your goals comes with bragging rights, but often times things get out of hand...pride goes overboard and morphs into the evil exessive type of pride often assoiciated with ego's and the like.  So, when then does pride blow up...NEXT ON FOX...WHEN PRIDE ATTACKS!!!!!!  Instead of coming up with a generalization to create a pride meter...i've decided to leave that work up to you and in place of those few paragraphs, I am going to write about some "Proud people" who annoy the Fuck out of me.  Headline:Suicide Rates in Schools with Evil Cheerleading Cults are likely to be 98.731% higher than in schools without them. These sort of people cheer themselves on... The warning signs of this groups are the excess of self-high fives, "Like OmIgodddddddds", and "GOOOOO US's".  These people are only cool because they think they belong to something that only special people JUST LIKE THEM can belong to.  Headline:King of the world complex drives football player George Hitler to try to take over the world, only ending in him nailing all members of the evil cheerleading cult. These people only join things  because a so called status level comes with it, and once they obtain the status level, they think that everyone else in the world owes them for just being alive.  Common phrases heard among this group are " I scored the winning touchdown last week bitch, blow me! "Of course i can cut in front of you!  Don't you know i'm the president of student council."  "I'm chadwick worthington III, my father owns the company your father works for, so wash my car you peon".  Headline:"During last weeks football game, there was major traffic jams in the bathroom line. True cause unknown, but the suspected person for the incident was known to stare at herself in the mirror for hours and having her ass kissed by her only 2 friends in the entire world."  Go to a party, and look around..you'll see this version of pride gone wild somewhere in a corner, and if you see this type at the PERFECT time...which is most likely all the time, you will notice this person and his/her 2 lackies pointing  and laughing at you or any other given person that isnt inside this twisted circle jerk.  Granted some people do suck compared to some other people as a matter of opinion, these Circle jerks refuse to be part of anything but their circle. Common Phrases : "You: Hi, how are you? "Response from circle jerkee:".....(ignores you, turns to lacky) LOOK AT THAT GIRL...CAN YOU BELIEVE WHAT SHES WEARING...WHAT A COMPLETE AND TOTAL WHORE" "...." "................"  Headline: "Bruised Ego causes student to kill a girl and her 2 lackies at a party" This type is known to go off and want to start a fight on any given chance; as soon as someone says something that they feel threatens their image, this type is ready to fuck you up. This type overall takes life too seriously and their ego is the most fragile part of their body. Don't breathe on the glass ego..you do..it shatters, you die. Common Phrases: "You:My car is black. African american w/glass ego (overhearing you:OOOO YOU DID NOT JUST SAY THAT..I gonna fuck you up cracker..we was enslaved by your people and you aint gonna be dissin me..i'll pop a cap in yo ass"  "You(to your friend) Nice shirt fag. Dyke w/glass ego.:Ya know..FUCK ALL YOU MEN..You're all womanizing pigs, thats all you do is use girls like us for sex, (kicks you in the nuts) (dyke turns to girl next to her) come on honey..you dont need to put up with this, lets go fuck)"  Pride..have it, but don't abuse it...or you will become as beat as a read-headed step child.  And now..i'm done talking about pride.  How much pride is too much? YOU TELL ME..until then...some lyrics that apply to something...can YOU figure out what that is?  "I'm head of the class  I'm popular  I'm a quarter back  I'm popular  My mom says I'm a catch  I'm popular  I'm never last picked  I got a cheerleader chick   Being attractive is the most important thing there is  If you wanna catch the biggest fish in your pond  You have to be as attractive as possible  Make sure to keep your hair spotless and clean  Wash it at least every two weeks  Once every two weeks  And if you see Jonny football hero in the hall  Tell him he played a great game  Tell him you like his article in the newspaper   I'm the party star  I'm popular  I've got my own car  I'm popular  I'll never get caught  I'm popular  I make football bets  I'm a teachers pet. "-Nada Surf  Peace -JHere's a bit of "wisdom" i found in my buddy Mark's profile: I've learned that you cannot make someone love you. All you can do is stalk them and hope they panic and give in.  I've learned that no matter how much I care, some people are just assholes.  I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and it only takes suspicion, not proof, to destroy it.  I've learned that you can get by on charm for about fifteen minutes. After that, you'd better have a big weenie or huge boobs.  I've learned that you shouldn't compare yourself to others - they are more screwed up than you think.  I've learned that you can keep puking long after you think you're finished.  I've learned that we are responsible for what we do, unless we are celebrities.   I've learned that the people you care most about in life are taken from you too soon and all the less important ones just never go away.For the first time in a long time, I was contacted by someone to write more stories about my actual life, actually...he said i should write about my "drunken exploits" Well either way...the question lingers...should I expose any aspect of my personal life to the public? Hmm...Reality...everyone loves to watch everyone else's "real life" on tv to remind them deep down how much their life sucks. No doubt though, reality TV is pop...Shows have arisen about families in real life, such as the Osbournes..Fat girls eating real life, such as the Anna Nicole show, there are "real life shows" that cover the genres of dating, becoming a star, and surviving in the middle of nowhere for a period of time.  As of last year, Musicless T V, introduced a new flavor into the realm of "reality tv", Greek Life.  Now, we've all heard about or seen My Big Fat Greek Wedding, and we know(or at least we SHOULD KNOW) that Greek life and Greek weddings have only one thing in common, the alphabet.  But regardless...GREEK HAS GONE POP. MTv introduced its first peek into greek life last year upon its showing of "Sorority Life".  Many criticisms of the show have called the first season of this life watered down and I agree.  The show picked a tame sorority.  The girls were very goody goody, and the pledges that weren't, were looked down upon by the sisters of whatever sigma something something pi.  We as the public didnt get to see girls swallow goldfish, or kiss each other, or even run around campus naked with "SLUT" written on their foreheads.  Have no fear though, based on commercials, MTv is ready to correct their mistakes from last season, with Sorority Life 2 and its new series, Fraternity Life.  These kids look CRAZY..just like most greeks.  Will this give  greeks a bad name? Fuck yeah...with their parents maybe, but who cares? They'll get over it.  The general public will finally get a look at why its good to be greek.  The older people will get to see what they missed back in the day when they were too big of pussies to become a pledge, and the younger crowd will be more drawn to Greek life as a result.  Everyone wins;well maybe except for the the greek chapters put into perspective.  Many Greek organizations have laws set in place against certain likely greek activities such as hazing, alcohol consumption, drug use, and bestiality, no wait..that last one goes hand in hand with rednecks, not greeks...my bad.  These exploited chapters may very well not be chapters after the shows air, but hell, at least they made it to Tv.  They sold their souls to go pop.  Nothing wrong with that, Publicity is publicity, and in the long run, publicity is money.  Speaking of money, Hollywood is cashing in on Greek Life, and the only thing big and fat about this wedding with a greek fraternity to comedy will be Will Ferrell's wallet.  Since Greek has gone pop, this movie is a surefire hit. The movie will pull in every "greek" to the theaters for sure, along with the inquisitive, and the usual movie goers: those who like comedies, those who like Will Ferrell, Vince Vaughn, Craig Kilborn, Juliette Lewis, Andy Dick, Seann William Scott..ok you get the point, lots of stars..lots of laughs, this movie is going to be money, and it doesnt even know it.  I'm in a fraternity, and i'm going to see the movie no doubt because it will be a good laugh, and if its not, i'll take it out on the pledges(kidding....maybe). Well speaking of fraternities, tonight is Initiation Night for our new members, pledge class, whatever you want to call them. This is the kickoff for a 6 week period in which our new guys do various activities to work their way into the fraternity and get acquainted with everything and bla bla bla.  Now obviously I cant possibly expose anything we do to the public as i'm bound by contract and fraternal bond to keep my fucking mouth shut, but if its drunken exploits you want, i'll try to give that to you.  BUT cough cough ahem..greek life is NOT all about partying...its also about doing well in school.  As academics chair of my fraternity, i'm here to promote studying hard, trading the beer for books, and getting A's. :) :)  Now with that out of the way, beer is good . Not because it necessarily tastes good, but because it has alcohol in it. Parties are good, and not necessarily because they have alcohol at them, but because they have girls drinking alcohol at them. I'm going to make an effort to let you in on  Greek Life here at ESU, and my life in general, because thats what you all want. I've always said controversy breeds interest.  Writing  these sorts of journal entries are extremely difficult because when you choose to open up your life, personal or public, to the world, it's possible many people will disagree with you, some will hate you, but EVERYONE will judge you.      It's important whenr reading entries of this type, to keep an open mind, after all it is a privlege to have a look into someone else's life.  If I do decide to write details about my life and you have a problem, comment, or compliment with what i wrote, hey, thats fine, email me ( jms504@juno.com).  In most cases I will post your email along with a response on this journal.  Happy reading. Congrats To Zeta Beta Tau Zeta PI Alpha Epsillon Class. Condom and a necktie.

My post that I was going to do LAST sunday was going to talk about how fucking insanely awesome Don's Party at the house was on that previous saturday.  Since theres no chance of me remembering EVERY party detail..heres a few. The place was PACKED...HOT..and covered in beer.  Working bar is the Absolute best job...thats where you meet all the people and the people love you because for an hour, you are their beer god.  Among the notable events of the night are me dumping a full cup of jungle juice all over Jenn Higbee because she spilled her beer on me, Ray dumping a full cup of beer on a girl because she was giving him some unnecessary attitude at 2am, and the girls walking around without shirts on...half naked chicks..always a definite plus.  Ray, Kayla, Erin and I had an awesome time.  Our tree in the fraternity definitely knows how to fucking throw some killer parties.  We were talking about renting a house semester at one point too, and that would be awesome...but I don't know if thats a good idea, since I don't have much free time(if any) the way my major is. I dont think I'd be able to handle more stress ontop of what I go through.  Anyway..awesome party..I was drunk...damn that evil don and his 7 kegs.  Late into the night on my way home I was treated by a FREE shower from mother nature.  In other words, it started to fucking POUR. But nothing was going to bring my  "high" down that night.  It was one of those nights where you feel like you are truly alive...high on life kind of thing..but remember, you have to come down from ever high, and I will get back to that thought later on.  The rest of the following days were hell and then some...Sunday night and Monday were spent in the computer lab..for hours and hours and hours..and hours :( NOT A FUN TIME.. you;d be surprised how annoying  and time consuming it is to teach  a computer how to sell you a fucking pepsi. ITS ALL YOUR FAULT...YOU DAMN CONSUMERS!...shit..i buy soda...fuck(HITTING MYSELF IN THE HEAD)..;) anyway...that was monday...then tuesday, some of wednesday and thursday were spent playing with cars and cdrs..which, unless you are Matt Young, you will have no fucking clue what that means either, but just know that it SUCKS... FINALLY..thursday night I got a chance to chill...stopped by the bar and grabbed some guinness and black and tan, and went to the house to drink a little...ok..more than a little.. I had a nice convo when I was working outside  with Jeff Collier about women, and then..the unthinkable happened..... I signed up for Beer Pong with My good friend, and new ZBT brother, JB Markle...we watched as The king of all beer pong at zbt, smiley, and his partner, Shaun Egge, destroyed the competition team after team. We decided it was about time to make smiley frown and crack the egge,,and BEAT THEM. Thats right...myself and JB..the underdogs. The game started out with the  champs handing us our asses, but the more cups of evil natty we had to drink, the better we got...we started to sink them...their lead shrank down to nothing and eventually we got the edge.  A half hour had passed of this INTENSE beer pong battle..it was 6 cups to 3...us ahead...and smiley...SANK ONE... FUCK!!!! EGGE sank one...FUCK FUCK FUCK  4 to 3.JB and I take shots..and BOTH miss.....SMILEY and EGGE take shots...One made one miss...3 to 3...out nowhere john and i make 2..get the balls back and miss 2, smiley makes one...2 to 3..John and I shoot, i made one, john missed.  2 to 2.  Both smiley and egge miss..balls come back..JOhn makes one I miss one. 2 to 1....Egge and SMILEY BOTH MISS.....I take the first shot and miss..and out of nowhere in one swift flick of the wrist...JB used all of his stored up redneck power...and MADE IT....WE FUCKING WON......HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!!!!!!! WE BEAT SMILEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  That was one of the best nights of my life...hands down.  Friday Ray and I decided to go home and stay over night. We went to banana Joes Friday night with Zambricki and Mr. Cella..  Place was packed off the wall with alot of lovely Valley Girls...something you don't see much of at ESU...the retarted midget was giving zambricki dirty looks and flipping him off as usual.  We had a few beers...fought through the crowd a few times...played the AGG....then went into the bar in the techno room.   Shortly after. Lou "Mr." Cella..saw a few of his students...they saw him..he got embarassed and left.  LOL never fails lou. Its kinda sad, because there aren't many people at home that like to go out and act their ages..aka party...be social..etc.. Lou's an awesome friend, but what he can do is limited by his profession,understandably.. and of course we encouraged lou to pass his students along to us..but of course it was a joke.  Towards the end of the night ray saw his cousin and we were talking to him and his friends..then we went into the dance club and got elbowed by some ignorant fucks, all who strangely turned out to be black..and i wasnt the only person that noticed that either..so FU... On the ride home we did our usual half drunken ritual of singing crappy 80s songs..though we didnt have we're not gonna take it..which was disappointing...but the night was still tits.  In other good news....7 dvd;s came to my house with the correct address for a person named Joy..and under PA consumer law , i got to keep them :) Also, ESU sent me some money, so I went to Muscle Mag and got some Cell tech and Muscle gainer and 3 new shirts to wear at parties :FU, Undercover Police, and Kappa Tappa Kegga...all for 20 bucks!  Saturday night...another kick ass party at the house..Ray and I were heavily plugging our first ZBT party of the semester that was supposed to happen today,monday...the Graffiti party.  The night came to a screeching halt when the NEW landlord came and shut us down...here's the BAD part I was talking about before. The guys that live at the house had a meeting with the new landlord last night and they have 30 days to get out(something about too many people not on the lease, and he doesnt want any big parties..now what fun is that?). This leaves us without a house to throw in.  Thats a major MAJOR problem in my eyes.  Now, being in a fraternity isnt all about parties, but its an essential part.  It splits importance with academics, Brotherhood, Community service, in the respect that..the way the community gets to know you is community service, the way people get to know you is socially...especially at parties.  This is going to fuck up recruitment quite a bit.  Those who dont see that happening are blind.  People know the frats by the kinds of parties they throw..etc..thats where you meet everyone..people you wouldnt normally see on a daily basis.  Theres a colony on campus, ACACIA...they don't have a house...RARELY throw elsewhere and theyre recruitments have been pretty bad... It sucks for the guys at the house especially because they are losing where they live...that Really really really blows.  I'd be lying if i said that i didnt care about drinking, being social..parties..hell thats ONE OF THE reasons why i joined ZBT in the first place..i'm in college to finish college, but i'm also here to party...i missed out on it in high school and i'll be damned if i'm going to miss out on it now.  I love zbt...my brothers are awesome..great guys..really..something you wouldnt expect with a FRAT(and shut up..yes I DO CALL my country a CUNT.Its the only place here i have an extreme amount of fun..its the only place i feel like me.. But I know life is about change and dealing with it. As a fraternity we now have to stay afloat and get people on campus attention other ways until we come up with a soluton..Slak,Kevin,Seneca,Egge, Joe B, Curtis ,Aaron, and Steve hopefully will be able to find some place to stay too..and rituals...who knows..i'm sure our fearless E-board led by Young Matt Young will be able to come up with something.   This news hit me pretty hard because it reminded me when something I worked for, and others worked for hard, for several years, Underground Wrestling in NEPA died.  But in this situation, by no means is ZBT dead...we just experienced a setback, we'll come back..we always do...Just like last time when that fucking flaming homesexual of a sad excuse for a human being, let alone greek advisor, kevin lockwood, put us on suspension last semester...FUCK YOU KEVIN..and tomorrow is officially FU kevin lockwood day...Where at The Interfraternity Council meeting tomorrow, he will be getting a collective FUCK YOU from all of the fraternities on campus because he is being a big DOUCHEBAG...and in honor of FU lockwood day..i will be sporting my new FU tshirt.   So well those were some sorta quick details about my life...  Now a few quick thoughts about life that i came up with today while walking to the caf.  -The past is gone, the future may never come, the only thing that is real in life is NOW.  -Life is ever changing...as you read this, something in YOUR life is changing, be prepared.  Umm...no song to think about right now..maybe i'll post one later.  As always, you have any response to anything here...email it to me..jms504@juno.com.  Its great to be a Zebe. RUSH PIMP!!!!!Hey people..havent had a chance to update lately..lots going on..and this damn computer decided to fuck up..so i had to erase everything on it :( I just read something on a web page sent to me about life..and it says alot of what i think...weird...read it for yourself..if you havent gone through this phase yet where you think this shit...you will...its not fun...read up kids.  From Katai's Indestructible Web Site: "They call it the "Quarter-life Crisis." It is when you stop going along with the crowd and start realizing that there are a lot of things about yourself that you didn`t know and may not like. You start feeling insecure and wonder where you will be in a year or two, but then get hot and scared because you barely know where you are now.  You start realizing that people are selfish and that, maybe, those friends that you thought you were so close to you  aren`t exactly the greatest people you have ever met and the people you have lost touch with are some of the most important ones. What you do not realize is that they are realizing that too and are not really cold or catty or mean or insincere, but that they are as confused as you are. You look at your job. It is not even close to what you thought you would be doing or maybe you are looking for one and realizing that you are going to have to start at the bottom and are scared.  You miss the comforts of college, of groups, of socializing with the same people on a constant basis. But then you realize that maybe they weren`t so great after all. You are beginning to understand yourself and what you want and do not want.  Your opinions have gotten stronger. You see what others are doing and find yourself judging a bit more than usual because suddenly you realize that you have certain boundaries in your life and add things to your list of what is acceptable and what is not. You are insecure and then secure.  You laugh and cry with the greatest force of your life. You feel alone and scared and confused. Suddenly change is the enemy and you cry and cling on to the past with dear life but soon realize that the past is drifting further and further away and there is nothing to do but stay where you are or move forward. The stupid ones plateau, the smart ones rise.   You get your heartbroken and wonder how someone you loved could do such damage to you or you lay in bed and wonder why you can`t meet anyone decent enough to get to know better. You love someone but maybe love someone else too and cannot figure out why you are doing this because you are not a bad person. One night stands and random hook ups start to look cheap and getting wasted and acting like an idiot starts to look pathetic. You go through the same emotions and questions over and over and talk with your friends about the same topics because you cannot seem to make a decision. You wonder what in the hell is wrong with you. You worry about loans and money and the future and making a life for yourself and while winning the race would be great, right now you`d just like to be a contender!  We are making a lot of mistakes, but helping one another learn from them. We will piss one another off, and laugh at the end of a conversation that started with angry words. We are a group that talks behind the backs of  the same people we call to meet up with on a Friday night, but we are sorry about it and we know that we were just being insecure like they have been.  What you may not realize is that everyone reading this relates to it and we are all in this together. We are in our best of times and our worst of times, trying as hard as we can to figure this whole thing out. We are friends, and in 10 years we will be friends who have figured out where we fit in in this world.  If people expect sincerity from others, they should be sincere, otherwise do not expect anything at all. Having heart to heart conversations is being real. Wish you and myself all the best of luck. Put unhappiness aside and go with the flow.  "   Keep in mind..i didnt write that...just borrowed it from that web site. Peace and Love JSAhh my precious journal..how could i Desert you like this? We haven't talked  in such a long time, other than an obligatory "Hey How's it going". But finally we have time to sit and talk about things...alot has happened since we had our last real conversation on the third of march. You've heard me time and time again talk about how  it only takes one second..one little thing to change your entire life..and how many many little things have to happen at that exact second as well...weird how life is.  Can you relate, Journal? I mean..You wouldn't even be "alive" right now had had a collaboration of many thoughts all at once...the need to express myself..the pleasure i get from someone enjoying my writings...the flashbacks to the old "Straight Up" and "Feel the experience" journals of sorts from the old JS michaels web page, my personal appeal to seeing into peoples lives(ie reality tv, matt youngs blog), some sort of odd motivation AND whatever else was going through my mind at the moment...at some point, Journal, All of thoughts sent me to blogspot.com and a few hours later..you were taking your first steps...you were alive..there I was expressing myself away..typing into this edit box what was flowing through my mind..i poured out my soul. Ever since then, when I needed you to listen, you have.  At times i've said some things here that maybe i shouldnt have exposed to the public, but still Journal, I dont see you as a mistake just because of any strife that may have come as a result of  your "birth".  "There is no such thing as a mistake...there is only what you do and what you don't do"  Write that one down..its from the movie Unfaithful.  Allright...well i'm sure some of you were amused..and most of you were frightened by me "talking" to my journal..but hell, how boring would it be if I did the conventional "haven't written in awhile" opening..that goes something like..bla bla busy..bla bla computer something...bla bla ok heres whats going on in my life...bye..  I've been looking through my link tracker and noticed a good deal of people i dont even know are reading this, and thats good..very good..for those of you new to my world..go back and read some of the older entries....half of the stuff here may mean nothing to you otherwise.  If youre not new to this journal...then keep reading....I know you've come back multiple times waiting for an update..and  I'm delivering now...Unlike the pull out method of birth control..i'm extremely dependable when i have to cater to my Audience.  Throughout this entry i'm going to write in some song lyrics from songs that are currently playing..I have my winamp on random usually when i write and there are about 2500 songs in the rotation...these lyrics may or may not have any relation to what i'm writing..Don't read into ANY of them. They are random.  I just wanted to do something different and unconventional..and I wanted to do something that pretty much made no sense otherwise..ehh..this is what i decided to do...the song lyrics will be displayed within 2 double asterisks...ya know..those star looking things... For example, lyrics may look something like this...lets pretend a vanillla ice song is on my winamp and i decide to write lyrics say NOW **Allright stop,collaborate and listen, ice is back with a  brand new invention** THATS what it would look like...and now that preschool is over, its time to dive in to my life..or something like it..  When last you really had a window into my life...the march  3rd edtion..You read about ZBT losing our house,a few crazy parties, Me and markle beating smiley in beer pong, and some philosophical thoughts about life. Just some quick updates on all of those subjects before moving on to now. The "house guys" got another house...pretty far from campus..its good for them because they have some place to live but bad for us that like to party...We did however a  few going away sorta parties and a tap with Lambda Iota **You kicked my foot under the table, i kicked you back, I cant Say i'm able** which surprisingly DIDNT suck..the first non sucky tap i've been to actually.  Smiley turned 21 at a good time because his beer pong career has been sidelined by the lack of a place for him to persue his dream...Ever since the defeat..smiley just hasnt been the same..some say he lost his smile...should we then start calling him 'y'..as in WHY did i lose to markle and sopp? hehe As far as the philosophical thoughts at the bottom of that entry..i havent yet found anyhing to make me want to modify them in any way..they seem to be holding true.  Now here's the part in my writings where I use an event to the past in order to transition into the present. In the last entry there was a mention of a trip to Banana Joe's that occurred the night before the infamous "Don's Party"...and that night that one second happened that would turn my life as i knew it upside down in a way.. I failed to detail that night but in  nutshell, heres what went down: **i aint gonna live forever, i just want to life while i'm alive..its my life..my heart is like an open highway..like frankie said "i did it my way" i just want to live while i'm alive**    **and a time to every purpose under heaven**   Ahh yes...Fraternity issues...last friday was a ritual of ours which i'm glad I attended...as you may or may not know, i have trust issues with people in general...and I think guys more that women, but anyway...I got a chance to really know the brothers that showed up..but even moreso..they got to really know me...By looking at me i doubt anyone can figure out who i am inside...my brothers that were there now know me..and I got a renewed sense of the meaning of brotherhood...we really got to **And i knew if i had my chance that i could make those people dance and maybe they'd be happy for awhile** bond..and to all those brothers who didnt show up..its your loss and i'm deeply pissed off about that... The fraternity seems to be quite weakened right now...the loyalty to the brotherhood is weak..and i've decided at some point to kick my skills for leadership and problem solving into gear and work on making ZBT solid as it once was...We really have a lot of brothers with alot of heart...they just need motivation and we'll be ontop in no time... If i had the chance i would certainly run for a position on the E board..and i'm really honestly considering it...but if run for anything and lose..i have  Ideas and i'm not keeping my mouth shut..i'm motivated, mother fuckers!! Oh yeah..by the way..i've been nominated for IFC VP...which i probably won't get..but it was nice to get nominated **and i dont want to lose your love tonight**  but i'd rather have a position in ZBT than IFC  Right now the thought train has died..john and ray are here..so i cant exactly be in deep thought..but thats my life right now... ohh and looking back on some quotes..i DID NOT force the songs to play while they were playing..and some did make sense with what was going through my mind but it was in no way premeditated... Time to not write anymore for a bit.. Bllllllllllllllllllllaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah..

Marianne’s sense of romance lets her connect collapsing in a graceful pool of cloak and limbs with skinning the soles of her feet on a hot sidewalk, and getting one more concussion from fainting along the way. Her hallucinations and the wild heat aid her. She smiles faintly when I struggle to pick her up, fluttering her hand at me as if to say she cannot do it herself, but that it is not worth the trouble. I think she is worth the trouble, and know she tries not to grunt when I put her across my shoulders and carry her home. Sometimes the walk home is very long, and I see that it is a large distance she has walked. Then, there are more and more frequent pauses as I stop to catch my breath, and listen for her slow breathing. Sometimes she has only just made it around the corner of our street, and then I turn around to see the curtains falling back down, the neighbors pretending not to have been watching. I would not look at them if I was Marianne, but I think she does. I think Marianne sees a lot of things I would not want to see if I were her. 	When she is back on the drooping couch, she does not look at me. I intend to fix the sofa; I will give it proper cushions with full ends and upholstery that doesn’t remind us of nineteen eighty-two. I will take away the brown-flowered curtains in her bedroom, and find clean white ones to go in their stead. The rugs should not be faded, the bed should not sag and creak the way it does, and there should be neither linoleum nor a plastic table cover in the kitchen. Marianne never thought that being an invalid would mean old red and green and beige and pale blue flowered sheets to hide the stains from when she could not keep herself from coughing in the night. She did not think there would be coughing in the day, too, and that some of it would be done in bed. I never (have never, do never, will never) ask her why she walks barefoot out the door sometimes, so long that I must go find her. I would not want to sleep on a tired, springy bed with stained sheets either. I do anyway. 	Finally, Marianne looks up at me from the couch. I am sitting in the armchair across the room, watching her and waiting for the present moment. She wants to ask me what we shall do this afternoon. Anything you like, I can say, giving her the decision. She will not be able to make up her mind, and we will turn the cushions backward on the sofa to redistribute the old fluff inside. There will not be anything worth watching on the TV, and we will be admittedly too lazy to pull out a CD player, so we will just sit. My arm goes around her shoulders, she slouches against me, and everything is just the way it ought to be. I will have to push her away, then, because her skin is too hot and I am afraid that I will begin to burn if she does not let go of me soon.  	Sitting on the sofa this way will only make new sofa memories over the old ones, and I do not want to revise the past. I will not suggest or move or even look to sitting with my arm around her on the left and left-middle gap cushions because I remember when her skin was cool. She did not cough so very much then (and coughing rubbish up was rare). Marianne and I are quite well matched, I think. The neighbors say so, and they laugh. Mr. and Mrs. Chotky have their prejudice intact (Marianne sees them and smiles all the same), but I happen to know that Marianne is not going to ask me what to do this afternoon because she does not want me to pull away from her. She knows what I am thinking. This is good. Even fevered people can be soul mates. Even fevered people can read minds, if they could before. 	There are many things that Marianne can do, these days. She can walk half a mile, in shoes, without fainting. She can, usually, dress herself. She can manage our calendar; every so often she will update it with colored crayons to mark the days in which we will go to a park or a museum or Ikea to sit on the furniture. I am teaching her to make pancakes from the bag, and she is teaching me to bake brownies from the box. Sometimes she has trouble with the flipping and the mixing, but that is why I am here. My arms are fairly strong, she says, though my culinary genius does not yet extend beyond pre-packaged food. I try not to remember that she does not have the energy to stand and work for longer than it takes to make boxed brownies. She particularly likes the interval between opening the box and eating the brownies, when she can watch me become befuddled and laugh. You’re learning, she says, you have to be the one to sort the process out. I laugh too, of course, and if the brownies are miserable because I forgot the yoghurt this time, we laugh again. She can laugh a lot, these days. 	One day, I bring her a book that I have bought in the subway station on the way home from work. I have a part-time job in an architect’s office as a kind of gopher, only they pay me more because they know my girl is terminally ill. We deny that it is terminal, but accept the money anyway. Perhaps someday I’ll get a real job there, and move up the totem pole? Twenty-six and I’m only starting off. I think we’ll be okay. Marianne protests that she is not okay- She does not really want the book I brought today, or the cards from yesterday, or the disposable camera from the day before. She wants me home, of course, she wants to be well again, and she wants a bottle of Lysol to clean her sheets with. I tell her that she might not want Lysol for her sheets, but she is adamant.  	In the end, we strip the bed and dunk the sheets in Clorox. We soak and drown and inundate the sheets with Clorox. [The sheets] are now slightly closer to white than they were before, but have mostly faded into beige. She is begging me for brooms, for vacuums, which we have, and for heavy duty window cleaner and ammonia based cleaning products, which we haven’t. Formula 409, while probably toxic, does not smell the same way ammonia does. It is also advertised as biodegradable, and I thus see it as a good investment. Marianne does not think that Formula 409 will rid her house of the old invalid smell. Twenty-six and this is how it ends, she says. Then she looks at me solemnly, and points out in all seriousness that she intends to scrub her soul of disease with ammonia. I do not want to laugh, because she may honestly intend to wash herself with floor cleaner, and if I laugh she will swallow it just to spite me. This must be stopped. I snort accidentally, in the effort to breathe calmly through my nose. Again, I snort a little, and my mouth is twitching, so is hers, she is laughing a little, then I am, and then we both are, as ever. Marianne flips to the first page of the book I have given her and shows me that a) it is a romance novel, and b) the main character is intending to scrub her soul with something or other. She had begun reading while I was searching for Clorox, and found it devilishly amusing. I begin to wonder if she is honestly as tired of living in a sick house as I am, or if she’s only made that up to use a line. Shame upon me, because of course she’s tired of living here; Marianne is here more often than I am. Marianne is always here. 	On Saturday morning, I make a feeble attempt to sleep past nine. I do not like venturing into the real world at 6:45 daily to make money- some days I am still a teenager. Marianne is a teenager too. 8:45 AM and she is sitting on my bed, considering shaking me awake, considering staring at me until I wake up, considering doing neither, and finally just staring out of sheer nervousness that I might die if she shakes me too hard. You are fragile, she says. I wake up, of course, and ask her if I have kicked her in the night. You are fragile, I say. Then I want to kick myself, because of course she has her own room, own bed, now, with Clorox-ed sheets. I must kick myself again and again, to remember that I am not going to forget sleeping with her nearby when her skin felt white and her rubbish landed in the pot by her pillow. It is all right, of course; a slip of the tongue at 8:45 is forgiven by her because we are going to make pancakes again. She will be a fast learner and a fast talker when she gets tired. Marianne has stopped getting cranky when she is tired. She is tired often, I think. 	When we are getting ready for bed, Marianne often sits on the bathtub ledge to watch me brush my teeth. She is very philosophical, then. You know, she says, having toothpaste on your nose is like having banana on your chin. Here, I want to laugh, but doing so while brushing my teeth opens my mouth dangerously wide. I think that’s why she says the things she does, to see toothpaste dribble out of the corner of my usually neat mouth. She strikes me as so young, then, or at least so fun. It’s funny that you connect the two, she says. Twenty-six and that’s just where we are, love, twenty-six. She pauses, and I stare at the mirror, brushing heartily away; thinking. I can’t say I’ve learned something from her. There is no lesson from her sickness, and I don’t want there to be; lessons mean closure, and we’re not finished yet. We’re going to make her well, we’re going to move across the country, and we’re going to be young and beautiful doing it. I grin, and lose a little toothpaste out the side of my mouth. I think we’ll be fine, I say. Twenty-six is a good place for us.The Song That...  ...describes me, myself and I: has not been written, i think.  ...i was listening to 5 years ago:"Little Black Backpack" by Stroke9  ...i was listening to 4 years ago: "Crash and Burn" by Savage Garden  ...i was listening to 3 years ago: "Everywhere" by Michelle Branch  ...i was listening to 2 years ago: "The Young and the Hopeless" by Good Charlotte  ...i was listening to last year: "Both Hands" by Ani DiFranco  ....that is all I listen to now: "Calling You" by Blue October  ...plays in the background if my life was a movie (and if i had to choose one): "Dust in the Wind" by Kansas  ...I can’t get out of my head: "Crazy for This Girl" by Evan and Jaron  ...I’d rather have in my head: "Stay or Leave" by Dave Matthews Band  ...i just start singing randomly (anytime anywhere): Happy Birthday  ...I sing in the shower and ONLY in the shower: none?  ...makes me think about the past: "Truly, Madly, Deeply" by Savage Garden, if you want camp flashbacks?  ...takes me back to my childhood: "Summertime" from Porgy and Bess  ...describes my [relationship] with my [best] friend(s): "Singing in My Sleep" by Semisonic  ...[should have] played during my first kiss: (n/a? but,) "She Says" by Ani DiFranco. nevermind the lyrics.  ...describes my love life: "I'd Rather Be in Love" by Michelle Branch  ...describes my fury, my anguish, my rage: too hard. the three are different.  ...reminds me of my saddest moment: but what WAS my saddest moment? try "Stay or Leave" by Dave Matthews Band again  ...reminds me of my most triumphant moment: "Ocean Avenue" by  Yellowcard  ...reminds me of something it took forever to figure out: "I'd Rather be in Love" by Michelle Branch, again  ...cheers me up EVERY time: "Love is in the Air [Ballroom Mix]" by John Paul Young  ...makes me sad EVERY time: "Fast Car" by Tracy Chapman  ...gets me hyped up when I need to be: "Sekai ni hitotsudake no hana" by SMAP  ...lays down the hottest beat: "Devil's Dance Floor" by Flogging Molly  ...makes me want to dance when no one’s watching: "You Make Me Sick" by Pink (the no watching thing.)  ...has the best harmony: "I Was On the Moon" by Apollo Sunshine, only not, i just like part of it. really, there's nice harmony everywhere  ...i will never grow tired of: "Never Was" by Allette Brooks  ...I heard most recently: "Crazy for this Girl" by Evan and Jaron. obviously?  ...will play at my wedding: i'll get back to you on that one.  ...takes me far far away from here: "America" by Simon and Garfunkel  ... sums up my whole turbulent or blissful life: "She's a Rainbow" by The Rolling Stonesoh, i must! not sorry.

Its uneven blackness spans a large area, with a graying log floating in the center. The animals appear to avoid this potential resting spot in favor of hovering around the edges to drink and retreat into the shadows. More grey, ropey branches lie tangled across the surface of the water, from the fall of the central rotting trunk. The jungle populace holds its distance from these deadly cords, the nearest life form being a single toadstool growing in the shadows. An adventurous pale green frog has recently begun swimming near the opposite shore, but the others wait in the shadows for proof that the predators have already come and left.   Keyboard pad, keyboard, cords, paperclip bowl, post-it notes  	A large rock stands atop a nearby plateau, overlooking the watering hole. It has a smooth, thin surface, with a blackness that the pond reflects. A frequent origin of strange noises, only the tiniest and bravest of creatures seek protection here- purple speckled tree frog of the same species as the pale green swimmer, and a colony of white moths.  Computer monitor, post-its, business cards  	Off to the leftmost side of the pond, after a safe space of red earth (trampled into circles and ovals by the larger animals), a large sloth has emerged to hydrate itself. The sloth is of a very light grey, and has not moved for at least twenty minutes. It is difficult to discern which end is its head and which its tail. Neither end nor sides produces limbs of any kind. Breathing is also not visible, but it is expected that it will soon ‘awaken’ to drink and slink away. This manner of appearing dead or inanimate is a defense mechanism of the grey Jungle Sloth. Cashmere sweater 	Tree branches swing low by the right side of the water. On top of these sit a variety of birds, possibly unsure as to whether the fallen tree branches are snakes or plants. One bird, a deep brown creature of the Armanus family, has opened his wings silently, revealing tan wingtips to indicate that his status as a male of mating age. He sits triumphantly atop a red jungle worm that he has crushed into submission. It no longer struggles for freedom.  Armani glasses case, red CD case  	Behind this more colorful bird sit a collection of oddly shaped birds. The first two are crows, one starved and gaunt, and the other with a tumor on his rear end such that he appears curved up at each end. Their black feathers are no longer shiny, perhaps indicating a flight across the desert to the edge of the jungle, here. They, too, await the clearing of the watering hole. Next to these two characters sits a black vulture with a particularly bulbous head, which he swings at random moments so as to inspire fear into the sloth and the other faking-death animals. However, his possession of a bit of still-red rhinoceros carcass indicates that he is no longer on the hunt. At his side is the last crow, with longer feathers than the others, looking particularly mild for the hot weather. A cool breeze blows in, and the purple speckled frog leaps into the watering hole.  Stapler, tape dispenser, rolodex, pink bank receipt, hole punchToday,....... hmmm. What to say about today, and whatever else has happened since my last post. I cant say anything here that would make up for whatever it is that ive done in the period of time prior to this entry. Im not going to call attention to anything that is particularly depressing tonight. Im done with that. Im not going to let myself feel guilty for something that i 'did' that doesnt require an action. I apologize, but i wont let myself feel bad. Thats the way ive decided i want to live my life, and thats how i will. Anyways, Neal and I took Emily out for lunch today as a late birthday lunch. We partook in various Italian festivities while dining at Joe's, and somehow started the day long conversation of "What are cars named after?" What in the hell is an Alero? Montero? Vue? Nobody knows. Anyways, after lunch, we all rode in Neal's car to Baskin Robbins, because 1) Emily wanted to go there, and 2) She didnt want to drive in the 'rain'. When we arrived, we deliberated upon which flavor of ice cream we wished to consume. Since im boring, and according to them, i like no food, ever, (but i am a fan of racism and Nazi's appearantly...), that i decided to just stick with the cookie's and cream. They on the other hand had to take the purity and wonder that is ice cream, and crush it beneath neal's (terribly clothed) legs of justice. They decided to buy " X-MINT." Some lame flavor to celebrate a far more amazing piece of cinematography. Ok, here's putting it lightly. It was the most unappetizing looking substance in the history of mankind. It was black, yes black, tar black even, and a dark blue. It looked like bubblegum on black top. Disgusting. So of course, they eat it, completely content that im totally and entirely disgusted by it, and then we decide to go roaming. The first stop, "  Cascades...." (in a whisper). Then around the Krispy Kreme parking lot. We saw a lot of nice houses, we gawked, and continued wondering what car names meant. Is a Grand Cherokee a really really really awesome Native American? Anyways, Emily had to go to work, so Neal came over and hung out for a while. We did nothing. For an excrutiatingly long period of time. Then Neal wanted to set up my bench press rack thing, which then involved rearranging my entire game room in order to do so. With that finished, and the clock reaching 9:30, Neal decided he was hungry, so he left. I didnt eat. James came home from Las Vegas later, and brought me some stuff. I smiled, its awesome stuff. And now im here, talking to my cousin from California online. Its been a great day, a simply fantasmic day. Nothing can bother me as of this moment. Oh yea, and Jeff didnt come to my house at 12:45 to get some blank cds without his parents knowing on a bike, in case you were wondering if anything of the sort occurred, because it didnt. Well, im done typing useless banter for now, ill probably resume that task later...  Song of the Day: A Beautiful Day, by U2 Quote of the Day: "What in the hell is an Accord?" Neal...Well, today wasnt very exciting. My mom had a root canal today, so, to put it lightly, she's not in the best of moods. She's not pissy or anything, just in pain, and i cant blame her. Anything that has to do with teeth is pretty much unjustifiable by medicinal reasons, and is almost always unbearable. Ive been trying to help her out all day. It made me really realize how much she does around the house, its crazy. I love my mother, as do most of my friends. She's adopted half of them, and she's always so cool about having people hang out over here. She's the coolest. Anyways, i was listening to music, (quietly), and just decided to download the most random stuff ever. Stuff that would irritate the hell out of most people. Can anyone say, "Im a punk rocker.."? Ugh... Yea, she dont know no David Bowie, no Sex Piestols, she's like 17, they're like 100. Anyways, i was listening to one of Avril's songs, and i just kinda noticed how during parts of the song, she sounds just like Ashley Elgie. Im serious. Listen to "Im with you", (for as long as you can stand it), and think about how Ashley sounds, its like exactly the same. Anyways, we didnt end up getting any pictures of Toby and his yellow diaper of justice, i wish we wouldve, but the memories will last forever. Haha, still funny... Oh yea, Michael and Jeff came over the day before yesterday, we hung out, it was pretty cool. Michael and I got pissed that Jeff was so good at Clone Wars, i was about to strangle the kid. We were P-I-S-E-D...... Pised? Im taking Emily out for her birthday tomorrow for lunch, anywhere she wants. She's not doing a good job deciding where she wants to go though. Hmmm, i played some more Metroid Prime today. Im still afraid of Meta-Ridley. Im pretty much afraid of that whole game, i dont really know why, cause its not scary. Ill probably try and finish it tomorrow. After lunch, if Emily ever makes up her mind. Jeff leaves friday, ill have another less person to talk to/hang out with, itll be sad. Meh, he'll have a good time in the north. I talked to a girl that i like today, we're gonna hang out some day next week. She's gonna stop by after she gets done doing her extensive cross country mandatory workout. Hopefully itll be a good time and i wont just be retarded.   Im feeling unusually content right now. Pretty much everybody i know, or care about at the moment, is happy. Its awesome how summer does that to people. My views on unhappy people are that they shouldnt keep hanging out with people that: A) Make them unhappy, or B)Are also unhappy. Im in a great mood, i have plans to do stuff this week and weekend. Itll be a good time. Haha, south park is a funny show, i just remembered a quote from the episode, "Asspen". A ski instructor was telling the boys how to ski, and he used the pizza and french fries analogy. "If you pizza when you shouldve french fried, you're gonna have a bad time. If you forget to pizza, you're gonna have a bad time." "When are we supposed to be having a good time?" Haha, download it, its priceless. U2 is one of the greatest bands of all the world. I hope Bono beats out the Pope for the Nobel Peace Prize. Haha. Also, you should listen to the solo that Mista Martinez wants me to play, its not possible. Carnival of Venice is the name of Satan himself. Download, and begin to cry immediately. Anyways, im done doing my rambling for the night.  Song of the Day: Im With You, by the Punk Rocker, AVRIL Quote of the Day: "I dont remember Pete being like that, kids, get the horseshoes..."Happy Birthday to Shauna!!!!!!! Oh, and by the way, what happened yesterday, all that talk, i was just in an extremely bad mood. Don't worry or anything, its all good. I had a lesson today, i sucked. Maybe i should practice...... I did get to see Mr. M's braces though. You can't even see them practically, its not fair. Anyways, im better than him at the moment, it made me smile. Anyways, people are coming over to hang out tonight, and my family is now gone. Hooray! If you want to hang out, just show up, its all good. It'll be a fun time. Tell Shauna Happy Birthday, or else. Ill update again later, with something happier, i promise. I need to go run or something, anything that makes you happy.  Song of the Day: Everybody Hurts, by REM Quote of the Day: "I just dont think she couldve done it, i mean, excersise gives you endorphins, and endorphins make you happy. Happy people just dont kill their husbands. They just dont." Elle Woods from Legally Blonde (Actually Reese Witherspoon)I am a selfish, heartless, proud, independent bastard. Its official. I think ive managed to piss every last one of my friends off in the past month. I love the fact that i dont know what im doing to anybody either. I pissed off jacob earlier, i dont know how or why, i was reading what he was saying, trying to really absorb it, and i was doing other things, like check and write e-mail, and he gets all angry because i didnt respond or anything or whatever. I dont know, i dont even know who im typing this to. I dont have any friends who read this anyways. So its just me, feeling sorry for myself as usual, but of course, i wont burden you with my problems, heaven forbid that i concern you with anything that has to do with my god forsaken life. I really do admire jacob for trying to help me tonight, trying to convince me im no burden, but if im not, then why did he get offline in a rage. I want to know the logic behind that one. I wonder if i have any sharp knives in my house... My head still hurts. I wish i could make somebody happy. Just at least one person, thats all i want. To make somebody truly happy for once. I want to be able to make somebody cry or pass out, or faint, or just fall over giddy in glee and joy. I could care less how i feel at that moment, but i just want somebody to be happy by my hands. Maybe Jacob is right, maybe i should open up more. But then again, what is this, pretty much open to me. Its not like i expect anybody to solve my problems. Thats the reason for why i dont even ask for help. I wonder why i feel the way i do sometimes. At least everybody else pretends they're happy most of the time. I was told tonight that i scare a lot of my friends, and that i make people worry. I feel awful. My head hurts, maybe ill do something to stop the pain....Yep, im in a super terrible mood/mindset today. I just feel like "whats the point". A friend of mine, who's been very awesome to me lately, summed it up well. He said i was apathetic, and i replied by saying that caring about everything has brought me this far, why not try a change. He knows me so well, he knows my feelings, he knows what kind of person i am, and i wonder how he knew that stuff while i sit here confused as to why i cant even bring myself to go up stairs like normal people, or stop counting things. I've had a lot of headaches lately. I've been around too many people and heard too many thoughts the past couple of days. My head hurts now. You wouldnt understand what its like to have to focus on what you are thinking about personally. Nevermind, i dont want to get into that. My problem is that i care about people, and i dont want them to care too much about me. I feel bad when i tell people my problems, because i dont want to cause any distraction in their life by forcing them to concern themselves with mine. I feel bad for making people talk to me about my problems because i know that whatever is bothering me has affected somebody else too. My head hurts. If you were here right now, i would know what you thought of this, and i would also know how confused you were while you read. Maybe ill tell you if you ask me what this means, but you wont believe me, its stupid to me. Im glad i have good friends, 2 mainly who both stayed up late to talk to me even though they have drumline camp tomorrow. I appreciate people, i just dont know why they appreciate me so much. My head hurts.   Song of the Day: Cross My Heart, by The Rocket Summer Quote of the Day: Any of the humorous things i felt or heard from people ive been around all weekend. True Friends: Ryan and JacobI leave today for my family reunion. Hooray... Meh, itll be alright. My family isnt as dysfunctional as some. It'll be a good time. Well, ill need to hang out with people upon my return, so keep your schedules open. I wont be online, or updating for a couple of days... and ill be bored. But, hopefully, my family will keep my occupied and in a good mood. Im happy now, i dont want that to stop.  Song of the Day: Die Another Day, by Madonna Quote of the Day: "Can you say banana?" "No!" Can you say no again?" "(no reply)". My baby cousin, and my step-dad. Mystery Count: 4 daysFamily! So many family members here today. Kinda a good time most of the time, but there's always the down bringers. The baby is cute, but its louder than Coach Horton, (if you remember him), and enjoys screaming, kicking, and breaking things. My cousins from California came down too, they're super awesome, and so "hip", (there's that word again), cause they live near Hollywood... or not so much the hipness. Meh, either way, it was a good time, much fun was had by all. My friends are still great, i just feel terrible for not being able to see Emily on her big day of birth. Most of the people i know are happy at this moment, which in turn makes me ecstatic. I feel great when everyone around me feels good. I could most of the time care less whats going on in my own life as long as the people i care for are alright. Wow, Conan was freakin hilarious tonight, haha, Wrist Hulk, haha, so funny. There's not a whole lot on my mind tonight. Im not still laughing right now, because toby got his diaper off, and we didnt get any pictures, sadly enough. I got to bed at 6:30 AM last night, and got up at 10, so needless to say, im a tid bit on the tired side, so ill probably get going soon.  Song of the Day: Rest In Pieces, by Saliva Quote of the Day: "Yea, i worked with a guy named Mofuck once. Whenever i would be showing people around the office, he would intentionally find me and make me introduce him. So i would be all, "Hey..... Mofuck!" and of course i would recieve an assortment of dirty looks. At least its better than when i worked with Likshit." My cousin from California.... OMG, funniest thing ever!!! Mystery Count: 3 daysTODAY IS EMILY'S BIRTHDAY! WOO HOO! wOOt WooT ^^! RAISE THE ROOF! EVERYBODY WISH HER A HAPPY BIRTHDAY, (or suffer the dire consequences), HOORAY!I just got done talking to Ryan. He's an amazing guy that one. We talked for hours on end about everything. Im considering him one of my great friends now, because he's done so much for me. I feel great now, probably primarily because i talked to him, and even started to open up about things that i normally try to avoid. I feel indebted to him because of the impact he's had on my life so far. Anyways, its early/late, and im in a fantastic mood. Just thought id write something out. I wonder if anybody is reading this. But thanks Ryan, you're awesome.Wow, its been an exciting night. You have no idea. Ok, so, i hang out all day, doing nothing, cousins are on their way, and my family has ordered pizza. While we all eagerly await our nourishment, (not so much me, because my teeth hurt like no other), we see a car pull up in front of our house. Excited that we now have food, my family gets up off of their butts, (hard to do), and go look outside, and who other than Mrs. Peek walks to the door. After talking to Kacy's mom for a little while, (who is a pretty hip and cool person, thats right, i said hip), we go back inside to continue waiting for pizza. When our pizza finally arrives, (which is hand tossed, which we all dislike), we eat, and then begin a whole new round of waiting, this time for our cousins. After they arrive, and exchange hugs and news from our lives, we hear the pleasant sound of children crying and dogs yelping. Oh yes, how pleasantly relaxing it was. Anyways, Toby, (my dog), returns from meeting the DOBERMAN that lives down the street, with a big happy giddy BLOODY smile. So we pack him up in towels and throw him in the car and head out for a vet that is open at 9 PM. After locating one, we go inside, toby dripping everywhere and I without shoes, to see the doctor, who by some odd chance of luck and amusement, has a MULLET, multi-colored frog scrubs, and an earring on his left ear. Many laughs i had in the car on the way home. Anyways, after Toby got his 3 staples for his LACERATION, and a big stupidly hilarious looking yellow diaper for his punctures, (haha, so funny looking), we returned home, where Toby then does not move after being placed on the ground again. He doesnt move at all, not even a step, its so funny. And now im here, still laughing at Toby's rediculous diaper. Haha, you have to see it, ill take pictures. Anyways, thats all for today, im done, and thats the extent of my day.Hmm, thought for the day, i need to do something with my hair, it needs a change. I know i promised somebody that i would grow it out, but im just looking for an idea of what to do. Give me some suggestions, or else you'll be forced to look at the terrible mess on top of my neck, (no, not my face, there's nothing i can do about that). Tell me what i should do. My cousins come in from Lubbock, yes the huge famous exciting fast paced headlining city of Lubbock, today and they are some of my favorite relatives. All of my favorites live far away, i wonder if thats a coincidence... Anyways, im looking forward to seeing them. You should stop by and meet them, they're awesome, and they have a baby and a really awesome daughter. If you stop by, it might also give them the illusion that i have friends, haha. Anyways, i just felt like posting something, oh, and funny thing said today...  "HopeToBeAnAggie: i wasnt trying to kill you hotstuff793: i know HopeToBeAnAggie: i just hit you in the face with a pool toy, and almost drowned you hotstuff793: LOL HopeToBeAnAggie: that's not attempted homicide HopeToBeAnAggie: just being really mean"  Yep, Cassie's great, if you disagree, i dont care, she's cool to me. If you get a personal quote in here, it means something, so feel proud if you do. Hooray for family reunions this weekend... oh wait, no. SO MANY SMALL CHILDREN. Im not a big fan of the tiny children, but whatever, its only for like 2 days. Well, im out of things to say, may post something later after day 1 of being with Rusty and Mindy, (thats my cousins names by the way).   Song of the Day: Calling You, by Blue October Quote of the Day: See above ^ Mystery Count: 2 daysA New Look on Life  So i've decided to start a blog. I dont care if anybody reads this, im only doing this for me. I've been thinking a lot, about many things, mainly my friends. I have the greatest friends. The most impactful lately have been my newest aquaintances. The people ive met, and gotten to know have given me so much without asking anything in return, and i feel so lucky to have them, even if i do sometimes do something stupid, like walk home, or hit them in the face with a pool toy, or talk to them late late late into the morning while they try to work on spanish projects. Anyways, if you're reading this, you probably already know me, and you know how i am to you. Im trying to change who i am, im trying to feel happier, feel more free. Im too paranoid about how people think of me, or how they feel at a certain moment in time. I know ive asked everyone reading this at least once if im bothering them, or if im annoying them in some way, and im trying to make that stop, because one of my friends, a great one in fact brought to light how freakin annoying that is. Needless to say, that will stop, at all costs. I also am going to try to think more about myself, not selfishly or egotistically, but more along the lines of getting to know who i am, what im good at, what im not, and learning to accept, and actually get to the point of knowing and enjoying who i am. My other concern in my life right now is that ill never experience love. Its silly to think that now, being only 16 years, 1 month, and 24 days into my life, but regardless of that fact, i feel like im missing out on a lot. My parents tell me such great stories of how their high school sweet hearts brought them such joy, and how it helped them learn and grow as a person. I want to feel that, i want to know that, i want to be able to tell my kids about it. Many of you wont, and probably never will understand how i feel, but i appreciate those of you who have at least tried.   Anyways, off that topic, i had the opportunity to hang out with some of my favorite people today. Kacy Peek, Jordan Peek, Neal LeBlanc, Cassie Cervenka, Allison Bennet, Brittany Payne, and Emily Hahn. They are wonderful, simply amazing. This summer so far would have been total crap if it wasnt for them. Also, ive gotten to talk to a bunch of new people online, and otherwise, you know who you are, but meh. Friends are great, have some, if you dont, you're a loser, and you should get some. Hmmm, what else to write, this is a first entry after all, so im not sure. Everybody else writes such beautiful things in their journals. Meh. This isnt for the enjoyment of others after all, i am pretty much talking to myself here. Kinda like how Emily says everything she types aloud when she's on AIM. Haha, good times.  Might as well end it with something cliché. Song of the Day: Tomorrow by SR-71 Quote of the Day: "I like to take the jello powder, and just drop water on it to make little gel droplets." "  Or you could you know, just make jello or something." Allison and I talking at Emily's.  Well, thats it for now, more to come, if i can think of anything to talk about.MARCHING PRACTICE TOMORROW! Kill me now. It was 101 at 7:00 PM today! I cant wait to sign my 3rd contract selling away my soul which forbids me to do/think/be anything but band. It wont be awful. Ill see people. The freshman will be there......... Ill see people, that at least is good. Maybe that girl who flirted blatantly x4 towards me has calmed down. I hope so. Or maybe i dont. I dont know, i guess im desperate. I dont think ill have many plans for the next couple of months, which is kinda depressing, but school wont be so bad. We always make school seem like Hell during the summer. It is sometimes, but half the time you're having fun. ................... "And now, the Keller High School Band, performing their show............. STARS!!!!!" Oh geez. I cant wait........ This show has to be better than the show with the Japanese techno we played while forming 'elemental' shapes on a football field. It must be better. It cant not be better. But geez, stars. Why couldnt it have been like, "And now, the Keller High School Band, performing their show, The Legend of Zelda!" or, "Star Wars" if you really wanted to keep some of the 'stars' effect. I would be all for that, just give me some awesome music, something ill recognize thats catchy and most likely not playable, and im set. You know what would be a great show, a Lord of the Rings show, like where some special color guard people could be the fellowship and such, and some could be orcs and elves and men and dwarves, (sadly to say, id be recruited as a freakin dwarf), but i would really like to be a Ring Wraith. There's nothing cooler than that. Nobody would be allowed to be Legolas, cause then they'd be perfect, and then everybody would hate them. Anyways, im just trying to distract myself from 'stars' for a little while by making up entire different shows. But whats sadder, is that im distracting myself from marching with other marching. Impressive, i know. Im ludicrously bored. I wish i could think of something inspiring or deep to say. But thats it, ^, right up there. Im not too clever as of today. People came over last night, it was fun. Thats it. Im about done. Actually i am. Finished. Fin.  Quote of the Day: "Yea, my dog of 17 years died" "  You're   kidding!" "No........., as funny as that is, im not......." Song of the Day: Tempered SteelHmmm. Im not deserving of this life im given. Im wasting this gift by making bad choices and doing wrongs to my 'friends'. The mere fact that i have friends still puzzles me. The fact that they read this, and ask me if im alright is something that i dont understand. Why do they care, why does it matter to them that i feel the way i do. I dont understand what makes them worry or what makes them fret over the bendable words that are written out in this journal. Why does it interest people to delve into my life, as they attempt to understand how i 'tick'. I hate clocks, but i love noise. Time isnt real. I hate the fact that people think you can travel through time, or stop time. Time is just a way to keep track of the decay of carbon based life forms. If you could go back in time, then whenever you accomplished what you set out to do would be completed in the future, and you would have no reason to go back in the first place. If you stopped time, everything would stop moving. Even atoms, hence, you would be imprisoned in a motionless universe. You would suffocate because you wouldnt be able to breathe, better yet move at all. And if you could go into the future, to see what will come to pass, you would then realize that whatever you did in the present didnt matter, because regardless of the 'choices' you would make, it would all lead to the future you saw, leaving you to wonder if you are actually living your life at all, or if you are just a puppet being dragged along by the ever present flow of time. You wouldnt have control of your destiny. Anyways, ive been wondering why i put my 'friends' in the awkward and often times bothersome positions i put them in. I know what causes it, but i cant help it. I need to do these things. But i hate that i cant fulfill that need without hurting someone close to me. I wonder how the lives of my friends would be different, mostly i think of how they would be better if we never had met. How the experiences and provocations i put them through have altered their lives, and how they would be if i had never done those things. I also wonder if when i die, that perhaps the world ceases to exist. That maybe, this world, is dependent on my existence, that the people i know, the places i see are all parts of me, and that when i come to the end of my life, that maybe this world stops. Maybe this world would just vanish, disappear, or if it would just carry on like it seems to when anybody dies. I cant see through somebody else's conciousness, which is why i think that maybe the things i see are here for me, and made by me. Its foolish. I wonder what the world   would be like if i werent alive tomorrow. I wonder if anyone would notice, and if they noticed if they would care, and if they cared if they would remember, and if they remembered would they mourn. If the world keeps spinning after i die, then i wonder what the point of it all was. Ive made little positive impact on the lives of others. I wish i was a better friend. I wish that i am a better friend. I wish that i will be a better friend. If i could, i would go back and fix my mistakes, if i could i would stop the world spinning so i could end the mistakes im making, and if i could i would go to the future and see how ive grown. But i cant. Im here now, only now, never anywhere else. I may never be as good as i think i need to be to completely fulfill what is deserved of my friends as a person, but perhaps ill reach something that is close. Im sorry to those of you who ive made uncomfortable, those of you ive made worry, those of you who ive forced conversation out of. I apologize, it wont happen again. Ill see to that. Time. Time marches on. Time sucks ass. There's not enough time in the world to describe how much my 'friends' mean to me. Not enough time to tell them that they've done too much. Not enough time to let them know how sorry i am. Either way, its time for me to stop. Its time to better myself. And its time for change.  Song of the Day: Time of Your Life, Green Day Quote of the Day: "(Silence of sleep)"The human thought. Always around, ever flowing, constantly inter-twining, filling our temporary filing cabinets with every scrap of information we gather throughout the day. Thoughts are merely images, sounds, ideas, feelings we experience, which are then brought back, and shown to us again as memories. Ghosts of what was, these memories dance inside our heads, keeping the past alive inside, and allowing us to taste what once was, and what has occured throughout our time, our story, that masterpiece of existence that is created by every person on Earth. The quick fleeting glances and shocks of thoughts that race throughout our psyche every moment of our days are all laced together in one fashion or the next. Some think of the mind as a web, or a net, something usually designed for ensnaring something. I think of it as a strand or a beam. Something that begins but does not necessarily end in an exact place. If you've ever sat down, and actually thought about thought, either when you try to remember how you got to the place you are now, and where you started from, you'll realize that everything you ponder is somehow linked, not necesarily intricated with something else, but loosely connected to another. A single word in a quote, or on a sign you recollect may send your thought process onto a whole other current, leading you to something completely different, or perhaps something remarkably similar. In any case, the human brain is exquisite. Any tool that lets something gracefully transition from one thing to the next without the realization of effort, or connection is truly amazing. Something that i believe influences a person's train of thought, quite often de-railing it from its previous track, is music. Music can change a person's entire mood, straight from melancholy to joyous, or from ecstatic to dismal. The melodic anomaly found in everyday sounds and jingles has an effect on people. Traffic noises, sad songs on the radio, crying babies. Anything obnoxious, or unenjoyable can cause a sudden and drastic change in a persons overall demeanor. But mainly, the way a person speaks often tells the listener how the intricate workings of someones mind is functioning. You can fake it all you want, but the tone and texture of the sound flowing from your lips gives it away. The eyes and face help marginally, but the chords of words, or shaky replies more than likely rat out the inner most divinations of the brain. Thinking is so simple, but figuring is difficult. If one is required to solve a problem which hasnt been presented before, the brain must leave all casual thought astray and focus on a single dilema. More often than not, this leads to stress, due to the over exertion of the mind, and the lack of freedom and happiness brought by free thought. The looseness of our thoughts keeps us sane, keeps us happy and relaxed. When a person is resting, they arent focused on something, they're more than likely not thinking about anything in particular, which eases the heart, and nurtures the spirit. Thought. Think about it.   In summation to all of what was just written, whenever you feel stressed, dont just 'relax'. Let your mind wander from the problem for a while, allow your brain to relax. Its not a physical problem as much as it is a mental one. Just think.  Song of the Day:Lying from You, Linkin Park Quote of the Day: There ought to be a warning label on families...., my cousin Tina People of the Day: Emily Hahn and Tina                               Thanks for the inspiration...Envy. Lately ive been consumed by it. The want, the urge, no, the need to have what others have, to be as good or better than someone else. Not ambition, not duty, but jealousy and envy. My favorite color always has been green, its really quite ironic. I find myself everyday wishing that i could switch lives/bodies/personalities with my friends and family. To know what its like to be them, to be better than i am, or so i see it. Im not really good at believing in myself, no, its not a strong suit of mine. Im not real big on pride. Thats at least one deadly sin i wont have to worry about. But then again, im not a real good person to refer to on sins. Anyways, i feel jealous, i feel full of want and desire. Desire for something i can never have, its impossible. A desire that will destroy me inside if i dont do anything about it. I must travel to the fires of mount doom..... oh wait, i got a little carried away. Then again, this will be a quest, a personal quest where i must learn to accept myself, and cast Tnilc Nesnah's Bane into the fires. Satron will not take me with his 7, the Singuls, i will carry on. Wow, its early in the morning, im acting stupid. So much Lord of the Rings. I feel so cool, not like a nerd at all, i promise. Anyways, im bored, its time to sleep. Its time to go into the Emerald Dream, and think of things that have not yet come to pass....Yea, its been a while. I dont really care at the moment. At this moment, i just want everybody to know that im extremely happy with most of my friends. And the others, well, they can go straight to a place thats not Heaven. The only reason being is that people randomly get pissed off at me, or have a problem with me, or are annoyed by me, and dont tell me. People block me, then say they didnt block me because they were mad at me, or had a problem with me. What other reason is there, "Oh, well, i just felt like i needed to block somebody, so i sat down, put everybody's name in a hat, and drew yours, thats my reasoning. Whoops, sorry." Yea, its kinda like that. Im not really mad, just confused, i am completely and totally content with my other friends. Jeffrey is back in town, which is cool, Jacob is not, he's on a 2 week cruise of the Meditteranean with his "poor as dirt on the cheek of a homeless mans face" family, and many others are yet unacounted for because either they dont call anybody, sleep all day, or are just at home, doing nothing (like me), and arent really in my mind to mention at the moment. I feel kind of rushed right now, rushed for what, who knows, ive been like this a lot lately. My head doesnt hurt. Which is good. Weird stuff isnt happening, which is good. Ive had the chance to hang out with friends, which is good. But i still feel frantic. I know i need to start my summer reading, but i have way too much time for that. Im still applying for a job, and yea, i know i can get one. Its not really an immediate deadline or anything that im concerned with. Its more like a countdown. It might be the countdown to when i graduate, the fact that i might not see some of my best friends ever again. Maybe its the fact that there's been a lot going on in my life, nothing huge, but lots of little things that make me realize that growing up isnt going to be just big huge bundles of 100% grade A quality fun. Money, relationships, work, insurance, bills, credit cards, check books, house payments, car payments, jury duty, parking tickets, heart disease, alzheimers, coffin shopping, will writing. Not a whole lot of that sounds fun to me, so i guess im just feeling frantic because i know my 'childhood', 'youth', 'teenage years', wont last that much longer. Its just a race towards 40. Wow, i dont want to be that old, but yea, i dont want to not make it there either. I dont know really, i feel rushed, but im not doing anything. Ive been sitting around, not really thinking a whole lot, just passing the days. They're going by fast, just like the last 2 years of my life. I cant recall my first day of high school, or the first time i met, or saw some of my current upperclassmen friends of today. My life is a blur, which is natural. Im just weird, i remember really stupid stuff. i remember breaking a glass dish in the kitchen of the first house i lived in when i was 5. I remember hiding under my bed the first time my step dad, ( in that time, only my mothers boyfriend), came to visit. I remember my first bike ride, and how i ran into a station wagon across the street. I remember swimming lessons, oh lord swimming lessons. Im still wondering how that water wasnt boiling, seeing as the DEVIL was the swim instructor. I remember he wouldnt let me out of the pool until i did what he instructed me to, which of course included using the facilities. So naturally, being like 6, i had very poor control over my bodily functions. Enough said. I remember my first pet, my first dog. And for the more uncommon memories, i remember sitting next to a girl in Kindergarten who would always say, "Move it or lose it." I was terrified of that girl. I remember eating lunch with my teacher in a courtyard in 2nd grade because it was a reward in our class, she always brought a huge huge lunch, like steak and fruit, and the best freaking cheesecake ive ever had. I remember the first time I met the girl i would be in love with for 3 years of my life. She knows who she is, and you probably do too. So many memories, but so many lost. I can remember things vaguely, great times i had, but dont immediately recall. I guess i just hope that the things i do now, this year, this high school experience wont end up totally like that. I hope that when i am 40, (eww), that ill remember my friends, and maybe even call them up every so often. I hope that a lot of things happen, i should stop. Things dont get done just from hoping, so i need to take action more often. I feel ok. I am ok. I just am confused as to why im in a hurry, and why my friends dont tell me whats bothering them. Thats all ive got for now. Im gonna go do nothing, and still be rushed.  Song of the Day: Nightingale, Saves the Day Quote of the Day: "Go Cavs Fo Sheezy", Cassie and EmilyYea, so its been a while. Its only been a while because ive had to reload my entire computer. Its been a good time. Might as well get this out of the way.  I Freakin Hate Physics!!!  Ok, thats out of my system. Well, ive changed myself for the better. Some of my dearest friends brought to my attention that ive been an ass many times before, so im working on changing that. No more whining or despairing for me. Im going to enjoy life for once. Yep. Anyways, im listening to amazing music, i know it sounds lame, but its orchestrated music, but nothing puts me in a better mood than a simply stunningly arranged piece of music. Im the biggest band geek i know right now. I realized today that many of the girls i know have names that in an "E" sound. Cassie, Emily, Valary, Espi, Natalie, Ashely, Kacy, Casey, Brittany, Whitney, Cheri, that kinda works, i dont know, im stretching now. Eh, there's not a whole lot on my mind. Oh yea, Katie. Ah, Katie. Yea, so ive been seeing some of the people that i used to be bestest friends with a lot more lately. Its awesome, like Megan Starkey, we were the greatest of friends back in the day. Maybe we'll get like that again. I havent been seeing Amanda as much anymore, i havent seen her at school not even one time. We'll hang out soon hopefully. People are coming to watch movies tonight, it should be enjoyable. Cassie's been bugging me about this stupid thing, so i figured i might as well find it, and then update it. So here it is.  Song of the Day: Orchestrated Version of the theme from Super Metroid (download it, its amazing) Quote of the Day: "I dont like you!, turn around!!!" Me, towards Matt Haefner. If you know him, you'll understand why.Hmm, this weekend was great. The parties were fun, especially the horn party. And this weekend not a whole lot happened. Oh yea, there is that one thing. My great aunt gave me her car. Its not cool at all, its a 1992 chevrolet caprice, but its free, and the insurance is like only $100 dollars, and there's nothing really wrong with it. So im not complaining, and my parents say if i can take care of it, and keep a job, 'they'll see what they can do' about a new car. So yea, its pretty cool. Im trying to make the car as stupid as possible, complete with fuzzy dice, beads, maybe some fringe, maybe some of those beaded seat covers. I dont know, stuff like that. And ive named it Remy Lebeau, because its burgundy colored, it has the fuzzy dice, and because its just a cool name. Anyways, its a pretty cool thing, but yea, the car isnt cool at all. It has a V8, which is nice, but other than that, wow. Hmmm, i really want a different car, but this one is free, and it might lead to a new awesome car down the road.  Song of the Day: Anything old sounding, to go in my old person car, like Bob Hope, or maybe a little commodores, anything that is old. Quote of the Day: "Here, this is yours now...............", "Ok............, thanks?"Wow, Haniman. He said 'uh, um, or err' about 242 times in a matter of about 45 minutes. He's a robat. Mrs. Benbow also has the most annoying voice in the entire world. But the most surprising thing of the day, is that Mrs. Casey was actually pretty cool. Hard to believe, i know, but she was nice, and she joked around. Its insane. The first day of W.E. was alright, it still feels weird saying that. We played through the first movement, it sounded alright, we need some serious work though. Today at practice, we had a kid come that had never been at practice before, so i had to teach him everything we've learned in the short time of an hour and a half. He might be ready for the audition, but honestly, i highly doubt it. Well, i was going to hang out with kacy today, but i never heard from her, turns out she was just out later than she thought. Anyway, auditions are tomorrow, im really worried about making it.............. Well, i got no sleep last night, i finished my homework, and ive had dinner, so i think ill just hang out, maybe work out or something, or maybe call up a friend. Meh, its all cool. Talk to me tonight if you want to, if you dont, thats fine, but id appreciate it if you did. I probably wont be able to sleep tonight either.   Song of the Day: "Cassie's Pimp Mix" Quote of the Day: "maybe"First day of school tomorrow. Ill update about it later. Im sick, ive been all weekend. Its a great way to spend your last weekend of summer. I got mad at one of my friends last night for no real reason. Im sorry to her, i hope she knows that. I rambled on to one of my friends and got really weird and aggrivated for no real reason. Im sorry, i hope he knows that. Im not tired, im gonna go practice, right after aqua teen comes on. Im hanging out with Kacy tomorrow, and ill tell her, and this about my first day of school. Itll suck probably, but oh well.  Song of the Day: Trinity Infinity from the Matrix Reloaded Soundtrack Quote of the Day: "Meatwad makes the money see, meatwad gets the honies she..."The sun has just set, leaving tinges of purple and indigo spread thin across the night sky. A mournful finality grips the land as another day dies and passes on, while a promise of a new day chases the emotions created by the waxing moon and gently sparkling stars. The cosmic events leading up to a sunset are incredible. As the earth gently glides throughout the universe, making slow revolutions around our most familiar star, the people living upon it never question or ponder what exactly is occuring in order to allow them to live their lives, see their family, be with friends, or to just be alive at all. People rely on the days to pass, even though they complain about how time flies. Sunsets are romantic, they bring people joy and despair at the same time. Darkness without light is frightening, but a midnight with a loved one is anything but. The pallet of colors cast brilliantly across the night sky as the sun grows dim is breathtaking. Pastels of life and love and happiness fill the minds of those who look upon the cascade of shades and hues on the horizon. A day without a sunset would be too depressing, if the day were as a light switch, simply from light to dark, then many would despair. Its the gentle transition from bright and luminous, to a serene and gentle canvas of violet that allows people to reflect, remember, and relax. A friend of mine gave me my inspiration through a beautiful image of such an event. Clouds cascading over one another as dancing rays of orange and red leaped across a lake. "These are such things that dreams are made of," seems to sum it up well. I feel poetic, even though my ramblings often seem jumbled or muttled. I wish i was eloquent, worthy of remembrance for my oftentimes delusional literary creations. I have other talents in which to fall back on. Like speelling, and doing grammar good.   But yea, next time you see a sunset, think about what it means to you. Think of the people you've affected throughout the day, and dream about what could yet come to pass in the future. Imagine yourself at your greatest, and try with all your might to reach that point in the following day. Be great. Be amazing. Be who you are. Be.  Song of the Day: Drops of Jupiter Quote of the Day: "And now she's back in the atmosphere, with drops of jupiter in her hair....."Tomorrow marks the day when CNN had the highest ratings of all television in the US. I know you've heard remarks about how you should think about how insignificant your problems are compared to what happened 2 years ago, but to me, (this may sound insensitive to many of you), but i think that people should really move on, and not dwell on things that have happened. Im not a big fan of reflection, but i think that rememberance is ok. I dont like putting emphasis on certain days, because then, that in turn almost forces people to think about the tragedy, and remember more than is necessary, and more often than not, memorial days cause victims to relive the trauma they endured. People should mourn, people should pray if you're into that, and people should remember, but people should move on, and maybe even someday learn to put the tragic thoughts away and every so often, think about it, without spending an entire day of memories and pain.   Anyways, im sad for what happened. Regardless of that, the incident didnt really cause any serious influence in my life. Nobody i knew died, nothing i owned was destroyed, and nobody i directly knew was hurt, physically or emotionally. I see tomorrow as a day for others. Forgive me if i dont cry, or ponder, but thats not the way i am. I dont fret over things that dont have impact on me. That's silly. The biggest problem in my life right now is Physics. I hate physics. Robots shouldnt teach.  Im going to miss seeing Cassie Cervenka every day. I hope she doesnt follow the trend of band drop outs and pretty much cease all communication and activity with me. But if she does, it would only be natural. I dont wonder why she quit, it doesnt matter to me. I hope she's happy with her decision, and i hope it works out for her. I dont think any differently of her, and i admire her for following through with what she wanted.   Emily Hahn has held the coolest senior i know award for a while now, and the most neato freshman is a toss up. Hmm, awesomest sophomore, ummm, maybe Ryn Stasky. Perhaps. Junior, thats impossible to say, there's the ever present triumverate of Brent, Jeff, and I. But eh, school is awesome, even if we all hate it. Without school, we wouldnt have friends. Im glad for school. I dont want this year to end, because the seniors i have grown so close to will leave. I dont know what ill do. There's a big world outside of high school, i know, but right now, im in high school. Im still a part of this overly dramatic, frantic, ecstatic world. I hope i never leave, but, its inevitable. After KHS, i may never see the other members of the triumverate. But after all, people need to move on. We cant dwell in the past. But this is the present, and im diving in. Im swimming in the vast and brilliant life that im living, and enjoying every minute of it.   Tell me what i can do for you to possibly bring you to my level of bliss right now. Do it. Ill try and make you smile.  Quote of the Day: " Clint!!!!   Emily!!!  Come on men! Lets head back to the showers, and get naked together since we're done tackling each other and rolling around on each other for hours on end!!!What dreams may come. I feel incredible today. Simply amazing. The day is bleak but my mood is bright. Today i feel as if my smile could break the cloudcover, releasing the entrapped sun and setting it free to beam down on others. I need a song, something ive only imagined, something ive dreamed of writing. Perhaps i might. Something with bold and easy transitions from favorite melodies and rythms of fantastic pieces mingled with a stunning harmony. Im fit to burst with happiness. I can guess as to why, but im not sure as to how. My friends are awesome. Just great. I wish i could say more, but the tiny clicks of the keys are feeding my need for music. I love the arts. Musical, cinematography, visual, anything. You name it. I dont know, this day is splendid. I need to share my joy with everyone i talk to today. It may be contagious.  Song of the Day: Only things that are created in the orquestra of my mind. Quote of the Day: "Never give up." from the movie, 'What Dreams May Come'The human emotion is a wretched wretched thing sometimes. The way the world can suddenly tear out the happiness and joy you were just in rapture with and twist and contort it into a completely opposite feeling is so destructive. An enlightenment, be it something really unpleasant to discover, hit me the other day. Its left me little to dwell on than itself. I find myself in a state of meloncholy and depression, as i long for something that i cant seem to grasp, despite the fact that many others  that i know can. Something that eludes me, taunts me, and kills me a little inside, every day. Maybe tomorrow will be different, but i cant see how. Maybe something will come to light, things will change, and all will be good in the world once more. The space that my friends fill is as big as ever, but the hole that they cant is growing. I need that sort of nourishment to be happy, and right now, i havent even had a taste of what i desire. Maybe tomorrow will be different. I sure as hell hope so. If not, things wont change, obviously. Maybe i can learn to cope, which is most likely, but maybe, ill keep dwelling on it. Hopefully not, but either way, its something that i have to do, myself. Nobody can really help, if i aksed, or if they wanted to. It doesnt work like that. I really dont know how it works, or even if anybody could understand this if they tried. Life is good. Friends are good. School is going as well as to be expected. But something still is missing. I wish i knew how to fill the void. Others can, so why cant i. Im only 16, i have the rest of my life, yea yea. But other 16 year olds, and then others that are younger are having no trouble it seems. I dont know, im rambling again. I just wish i didnt need to. This stupid journal has seemed to be somebody i can talk to. Somebody who wont judge me, or mock me. Somebody i dont have to worry about thinking differently of me, or pitying me, or laughing at me behind my back. If i only i could find somebody like this to help me fill the space. If only. Maybe tomorrow will be different.  Oh yea, and hey, if you're reading this, maybe people will like you more, or not talk bad about you behind your back, or act two faced towards you if you dont take people's pretzels, or stare at people because they're having a good time, or ask people to be quieter for no reason. Its just a suggestion. I guess i would be corrupted too if i dated somebody who looked like they just got back from a photo shoot for a gushers commercial.  No quotes worth putting. Song of the Day: Adagio for Strings, Jeff's right, it does own you.Friday, people are coming over, you should too if you want. If we're good enough friends, just come over and hang out, itll be a party. A big festive festival complete with all of the festivities usually associated with festivals of the festive variety. Yea, party, itll probably happen, and have movies and games and food and people and air and stuff. So come if you want. Or dont, it doesnt really matter, but ill be having fun.Ah, the journal. This simple expression of inner thought. I dont really understand the appeal of writing in it, but there is definately an appeal. I deleted the past 2 entries i wrote. I find them outdated and depressing. If you must see them, i might show them to you, but oh well, the past is the past. Im starting over, and i really like the way things are now. Im glad that the people that i call friends are such forgiving people, and are completely amazing for making their decision. But enough about the tedious workings of my life. I feel inspired. Again. This time not to write a masterpiece, or to talk about what i think, but to just write. To just say what will flow from my fingertips. To write what comes to my hands, as they glide across the wireless keyboard of my soul. I think its great that things are going well for everyone. Everyone, basically is happy, and thats with little exception for the first time in a while. I think its amazing that i can be with and around the people i am all the time. And i hope that i can bring somebody else that i think is really special into that group. Im glad that the sun rises every morning, and im glad that it will continue to do so even after im gone, (at least for the next 80 billion years...). But yea, high school is coming to a close for some of the fantastic people that i have become aquainted to, and i feel that i will miss them more than i think. It wont be keller without them, and it could quite possibly be more boring than ever. When people leave, this town dies a little. Its not a real town to me, its more like a collection. Its just a story of people. Its an anthology of lives. Nothing happens here, in this village, but there's always something to do. I find that fascinating. Ah, Toby is not rugged anymore, and my mom finished my blanket. Its really quite neat. Toby is clean, and i am warm, things are going well. I find that when i write for pleasure, its......... pleasureable, but when i write for zell, its....... not. I cant seem to express myself when i write for a prompt or an assignment. Here, i can say what i wish, without fear of grade or censor, and i dont have to worry about being ridiculed for my expression. Hmmm, i dont really have anything to write about, but just writing makes me smile. Smiling is good, and ive missed it.   Im making a cd for buddy, and i get an excuse to download some great music for her. I also made $100 for selling my old decrepit laptop. Today was good. I played computer games with jeff, and it took forever.   I feel fragmented, but then again, the passage of time this weekend has felt irregular. I wonder why. Maybe the planets are in alignment, or i can sense the leap day, but either way, i feel like ive been stretched. I like the feeling. I feel like there's more time. So im happy. Generally and genuinely happy. I talked to a cool kid the other night who said that he read this for a while, and that it moved him. I dont know if thats true or not, i dont see how it could be, i mean, im not that inspirational, but it prompted me to start this up again. Im not going to change the way i write, but im going to change my outlook.  Insight into my life is all that this offers to others, but to me, it offers an unquestioning ear. It offers understanding and comprehension of all my subtle metaphors, and all of my gentle allusions. I really think that i get too deep in it sometimes, Ms. Zell didnt catch them in my narrative. That made me sad, but im going to talk to her about it. She's going to let me try again. I just hope that ill get another muse. I loved that paper, but it was difficult to grasp. I understand that. Hmmm, maybe ill post it sometime. If anybody wants to see it. I havent had anybody read it but Ms. Zell, and myself, so, i guess it should be shared eventually.  I like long posts, but im surprised that you've stayed reading this far. Its just rambling above. But now i think ill say something meaningful. I think ill say that i enjoy it when my glass is full. I enjoy seeing things half full, even when its apparent that they're half empty. Deliriously oblivious, i have promenaded through the weeks, and made myself aquainted to the sounds of relaxation.   I hope to be trendy tomorrow, i hope to be stylish. Because Cassie and Emily helped me pick stuff out.   Listen to Hoobastank, "The Reason" "You're like my inhaler, I just can't breathe without you."  Thanks for the interest.I guess im just a hopeless romantic, but im growing weary of this loneliness. I thought i found somebody that i could confide in, but i was wrong i guess. I feel dumb for letting myself get down over stupid things like this. I feel ridiculous for getting upset for never being kissed. I feel like an 8 year old. I just want to experience what everyone else has. I want to 'fit in', yea, i want that, even though its 'evil' and 'pressuring', it still lets you relate. Being separated or segregated from a group in your head makes you feel differently. I had hope that things would change for a while. Turns out it was just my own naive ideals that crushed my hopes. I keep telling myself im doing something wrong. I keep telling myself that im not doing something right. I know thats wrong, but thats all I can determine. I want someone i can be close to. Someone i can be with and be comfortable. I want a person to know what im thinking, and to care about what i have to say. I want somebody who, when im talking, isnt just waiting for their turn to speak. I want somebody who gives up their turn to listen.  I want to be wanted.Hmmm, today was interesting. I was either heading to, or coming from, a PETsMART 8 times today. Toby needed a haircut, and now he looks goofy, so i had to drop him off, then come home, then go get him. Then, i was going to apply there with Emily, but she wasnt going to make the 1:00 time, so i was practically there, so i turned around and went to her house for a bit. Then we went to the post office, with the 1 human attendant, and mailed a piece of postage and spied an awesome little resturant. Afterward, we headed to a different PETsMART to finally apply at 2:00, and arrived at 1:50. Ok, here's where the fun starts.  Mr. Manager, (we never learn his name), greets us at the door after the cashier, (probably my future job if im accepted), calls for him, and he takes us back to the staff room thing to watch an awesome movie. The movie's first 20 seconds consist of the camera zooming in on the stupid ball that bounces off of the 's' on the PETsMART sign, which makes it lower case for some reason. The movie is really corny, and gives me the message that if you don't wear your name tag to work, you'll end up killing all of the hamsters or fish or something because 'if you dont complete all of your tasks here, you may be endangering the lives of pets.' Yea, so, i suppressed my laughter the best i could, (as did Emily), and i made it throught the video. Halfway through the video, at about 2:00 exactly, another applicant, we'll call him "Late Guy" walks in. Despite the fact that he's the only puntcual one of all 3 of us, he still appears late, which forces Mr. Manager to replay the video for him. The incesant smiling of the host guy in the video droned on in my head as i began to tackle the arduous task of compiling the huge sum of unnecessary information required for the completion of a gigantic application repeating over and over that, in simpler words, 'Drugs are bad, you'll get fired if you use drugs.'   Anyways, after the video and application phases, the next, more embarrassing part of the application process began. Mr. Manager took us one at a time into his office to ask us job-related questions. I, of course being the first to finish the application due to the time saved by avoiding having to write down any previous employment locations, was served first with a barrage of very vague and confusing questions/activities. I have hereby branded myself with the title, "New Guy", due to my lack of job experience. He takes me into his office, and the first words he says are, "So, this could be your first job." Wow, um, yea, it will be, and for the sake of it, we couldve stopped there probably. Oh no, the fun went on. Ok, here goes, tell me how you wouldve responded to this. "OK, we're going to do some role-playing, ill be a customer, and you be the associate. I'm in the leash aisle, how would you approach me," says Mr. Manager. Hmmmm, uhhhh, hello sir, can i help you......? Anyways, you get the picture, it went on for a while, and i stumble through it, and he tells me what i couldve done better. Eh, more vague questions came afterward, i answered them with help from my encounters with some of Murtagh's questions, and did my best with those. Me, "New Guy", had finished.  Emily's turn comes. She says that she made herself sound really dumb. Mr. Manager seemed to have an extra skill in that area that few have. She says that she responded several times with phrases like, "I love animals," or, "I like rats and fish and....." Yea, we all had a good laugh. It was quite funny. So then she labeled herself "Ditsy Girl". She had questions like, "How would you rate teamwork on a scale of 1 to 10?", and thats all. Its kinda like, "Hmmm, lets see here, How? on a scale of 1 to 10." So the questions were broad.  We both know "Late Guy" got a job, hands down. He seemed like he didnt give a damn, so he's in. But i think its a battle between "I love animals," and "I have no job experience." I really dont know who will win. I mean, i might be shelling out change to people buying dog sweaters next week, who knows, or Emily might be working in the fish section, because she really doesnt want to work in the equine section at all. Eh, it was fun/hilarious, and afterward there was some good food. You should all go out and apply for random jobs. The only thing is, you might get one. Wouldnt that suck. Eww, work. The rest of the day consisted of usual teenage hanging out, and the watching of many music videos. All in all, a good day. Now, its getting kinda late, not really, but eh, and i need to decide which bed is closest and easiest to dive on to before i fall asleep in this chair. Im lazy, but maybe soon, a working man. Gross.  Song of the Day- I Believe In a Thing Called Love- The Darkness (GO DIE YOU CRAPPY BRITISH BAND) Quote of the Day- "It's America's Funniest Home Videos, either somebody will get racked, or people will die, because thats hilarious."Yea, spring break is almost upon us. I can practically smell it. I can taste the freedom, and i can hear the laughter that is approaching. The next 2 weeks should be good. Purely good. Only a few things are bothering me. Maybe just one, and it starts with "M" and ryhmes with Nurtagh. She gave us this enormous  ass ignment over the break. I really dont like that woman. But whatever, she wont ruin my break. Maybe ill figure out this person ive been so confused with. I hope so. Eh. Some things have been brewing for a while, and they finally erupted. Everybody knew they would, i just hope things are resolved quickly. My dad's house was really close to the area that the people on the news are talking about. The damaged houses on the news are about 5 miles from my dads house. I hope he's ok. I love my dad. A lot. He lives by the lake, a lake that should be visited by my friends this summer. Visited before they leave for college, or get ready for the upcoming school year. Yea, that'd be grand. I have to turn in my schedule tomorrow, but im afraid to take "Adolf Whitler." I really am afraid of that class. Im writing a definition paper for Zell that hopefully she wont despise like she has my others. Im really putting a lot of effort into it. I already have an outline, and i have planned to write a draft of it every 3 days. It will be excellent, or else. Im so tired of school right now. I have to study for Zell's test, because i need to do well to raise my terrible average. I need to do well so she will not hate me as much.   Alison Fudge, (a truly awesome chica), gave me a copy of her hoobastank cd. Ive listened to The Reason about 15 times in the past 2 days. Its so beautiful. Kinda reminds me of..... Anyways, i like it when it rains. I dont like walking in the rain with an umbrella, i feel like im trying to defy nature. I remember sprinting through the driving rain in florida with my friends last summer. Thats where i really got to know Emily and Cassie. They're really great friends. Truly great. Im glad i got to learn about them that trip, and i think it was an interesting experience with the whole extreme trouble action. Yay for hidden theme park attractions in Canada. With Canadians.  Yea, i think the rain is peaceful. Even if it is torrential. It washes my worries away. I feel like the rain fills that glass that people label optimists or pesimists with. It makes me optimistic. I look blindly at things, and always see hope when it rains. I love the rain. I wish i lived in seattle. Maybe not, but it was a thought.  Song- "Until the Day I Die" -Story of the Year Quote- "Back of the line filthy sophomore!"-Mr. Henderson when honestly thinking i was a sophomore when we were signing up for buses.Sorry for not updating in forever, but Mrs. Zell has sapped any love of writing that i may have ever had from my body. I dont plan to write in here for a bit, so dont keep checking back, even though i know that pretty much nobody does, i mean seriously, its me rambling, why do you even look? Eh, stupid AP tests, stupid calculus, stupid powerpoints, stupid prompts. I do not like school, but yea, yay for really cool people, people who's birthdays are may 11th. Yay.  Song- Happy Birthday Quote- "Somebody gave me these cookies,  yea, but its april fool's day, so be careful,  yea, they're probably heroine cookies, *shakes on floor* 'they're so good!' " Katie and I discussing the cookies she recieved from a stranger on apr. 1st in english, good times, good timesI would like to request some inspiration, as odd as that sounds. I want to hear from people, their comments, opinions, anything, about anything. I would love to just take in their thoughts for a while, so i can try and unwind from my own anticipations and anxieties about life. I'm delieriously happy now, all the time. I love my friends so much, they are by far the most influential and wonderful parts of my life. I wake up everyday, and hope that i get to see them and talk and laugh like always. It fills me with glee to know that ill have at least one more summer with all of them, and I'm even more glad to get to know somebody i think is very special. Please, tell me what you're thinking. Tell me how you feel, and give me some insight into your life. I'll make this an ongoing thing, something that i believe can be something that i could be very proud of. I just really want to live with other people. I feel more alive when people are around, they complete my character and motivate my soul to shine.  Just talk. Release your thoughts through words. You dont have to partake in this excersise of communication, but if you have anything at all that you find interesting or important, please share. I think of this journal as something to help unleash my creativity from time to time. I love some of my previous entries more than anything ive written, because they're real. They're free-flowing thought, something that cant be taught or developed. It just occurs naturally and oftentimes results in some of the greatest art in the world. Think and speak and share and communicate, its the only way to introduce the world to the beauty of your life.  On a side note, I absolutely love Tina Fey, my car, dancing when nobody's watching, eating things that would make Dr. McReynolds cringe, being with my bestest of friends, making fun of dumb people, and realizing things about myself. I love these things. I love living so much, and have for a while now. Things used to be so different, but things change, like all things do. So i dont expect this bliss to be permanent by any means, but i do want to embrace it while i can. Tell me things you love. Off the wall things. Things you didnt even realize until you sat and thought about it. Just tell me.  I would like for this to become something amazing. Like a compilation or memoir of all the people i know. A literary memory of our friendships, regardless of how in depth they are. If you think this is stupid, tell me, thats still a thought, and still an opinion that should be expressed. I love long posts. I know somebody else who does also. They've told me so.  Summer should be tomorrow, it really should. Id get to experience so much more if i were free all the time. I want to learn so much. I want to see and taste and feel more this summer than any other, and i want it to last much much longer. I want to be with my seniors, the seniors ive grown so close to that i take for granted the pleasure of seeing and conversing with nearly everyday. But they're going through their own set of worries. College and what not, and the moving away ordeal. It must be hard. I really want them to be happy, they're amazing people. Meet them.   Let a stream of moonlight fill your sight with intuition, and let yourself foresee your own happiness. Bask in the rays of your own ecstasy and realize that you're living for you. Make a time be your own, and dont be afraid to embrace a moment. Take part of your life, and dont let it take control of you. You're in control of your own destiny, and the paths you take will lead you where you wanted to go. During your journey, keep gazing skyward, to remember the past, and look beyond to your future. Keep your spirits high, and raise those of others to your level whenever possible. I want to bottle some moonlight sometimes, just to shine on people when they're not as inspired as I.  If any of this makes sense to anybody, then im glad that somebody understands what im thinking. If not, then tell me your interpretation, its yet another form of expression, analyzation, and thought.  I really didnt expect to write anything tonight of any real significance, but now, im quite happy with whats come to me.  Listen to something that makes you smile. Recite a quote that makes you laugh. Live.  ~ClintYay for good things. I got a new car. Come see it. I got a new X-Box. Come play it. And now i have a new outlook on life. Come meet me. New stuff, new friends, new opportunities. Yay for people and their neatness, and yay for my friends liking said people. Yay for life, but boo on ap tests. Boo i say, boo. I should've taken a $42 sick day. But then Westbrook wouldve written me up for that too. She's given me 3 detentions for being either actually sick, and at home, and not skipping, being on band trip, and not in the county, or being in the gym taking a damn ap test. She really needs to stop ninja-watching, and get to checking accurate roll.   But yea, yay for people and things and events that make me happy. Yay for banquet last weekend, and yay for my date and my friends, and everything.  YAY . And its almost summer again! Its a good time, and my writing sucks ass. Its not creative, or neatly flowing in form, its straightforward, childlike, and relatively simple in articulation. But im analyzing more literature, even after a 3 hour english test. Boo AP tests. Boo. Yay for maybe seeing somebody tomorrow in english again after their $42 sick day. YAY.  Song of the Day: The Hey Mama that we didnt get to dance to...Hmmm, so im sitting here, thinking to myself, what is something interesting to put in here. Well, ive thought about it for a while, and had some okay ideas, so i think ill just start writing, and see what develops. Here goes...  I played freeze tag with small children a while back at my dad's house in Acton, Texas. Afterward, (several hours afterward i might add), i thought about how every step in human development has its own common desire. I became aware of the fact that kids do whatever is in their power to make games last forever. While playing freeze tag, the kids started cheating in order to keep the game going. I played freeze tag, as "It", for 2 hours straight without finishing a game. I came to the conclusion that the first stage of human life never wants the game to end. The game that is life. The unfolding adventure of each new day, and any misadventures that occur along the way.   Later, i realized that the second phase of development is the phase im currently a part of. The adolescent, pre-adulthood, teenage years. I know that all of us have thought about leaving our hometowns at least once a day, every day, for the past several years. How you'll miss your friends, the people you've spent your childhoods with, your favorite times together alongside, and your hardest times working through with. I read my last post just a moment ago, and saw how desperately i wanted to be done with school, but i remember, at the same time, i  dreaded the fact that it was another step in the direction of dispersion. The friends that i will inevitably part from, and yes, possibly forget one day, are what keep me sane and alive every day. I decided that teenagers never want their 'lives' to end. They never want to leave what they've grown so accustomed to, and what they seem to grow in to. The possibility of a different, possibly less pleasurable, possibly more difficult prospect of life after high school and college is something that people like me want to keep at bay. I want these years to never end.  Although i havent experienced the next phases myself, ive gathered enough experience with people of these classes to be able to formulate ideas on them. People in there twenties and thirties, for the sake of classification, lets call them 'youths' as it were, despite their age in comparison to my, or possibly your age, seem to treasure just that, their youth, above anything else. The ability to play, run, jump, drink, smoke, dive, swing, swim, and sex with no regard to the consequences is the drug of choice to the people in this class. The fact that their bodies are still capable of everything they could in the teen years, and the fact that they're adults and of expanded experience, creates something that is precious, a sort of limited opportunity for bliss. I see the main fear of these people as the process of aging. I think that the 'youths' never want their youth to end. They want to stay as virile and agile and mobile as they can for as long as they can. They want to stop the clock.  Mid-life crisis survivors and other middle aged people are the next classification. The fact that they're not a 'youth' anymore encroaches on their minds as their years accumulate. They buy expensive objects in hope of appeasing the need for their youthfulness, and explore new endeavors in hopes of drowning out the memories of their past. The inevitability of decrepitude begins to haunt their dreams. Middle-aged people never want their health to leave them. They want their youth returned, and their vigor restored. They want the clock to turn back.  The ancients, the elders, the decrepit, the geezers. They spend the rest of their days reflecting on their lives. Their experiences, their thoughts, their ideas, and their loves. They tell the youngsters stories of when they themselves were young, while often their tales fall on bored ears. The idea of youth is gone, and the fear of death and the realization that it could be close at hand is ever present. The elderly wish for their memories to sustain them, and their offspring to remember them. They want the clock to keep ticking.  I love writing, as you probably have guessed. But i also love feedback, be it positive or negative. I like to observe, i like to interact, and i like to experience. I wish i could say something deep in here, but i just write down what i feel.   I want to go see Dodgeball and Anchorman with somebody. They know who they are. I will break them out of their house if their parents wont let them.  There's only two songs on my mind tonight, Masque for one, its the only song i whistle at least once a day, and Roxeanne, the Moulin Rouge version, because "its so powerful."  Write something down whenever you get the chance, itll brighten your day. By the way, now you can leave comments on any of my posts, it would make my day if you left some, and remember, i can delete the ones that are stupid. So if you're stupid, dont bother leaving a comment. ~ClintThis blog will be dedicated to computer questions I answer, etc... sort of like a show notes type thing without the show.

It was better than I expected it to be, actually...  I am trying to update my blog more than I did in the old one, but as you know, I have an extremely boring life, and have little to talk about ;-)  Anyway, I am working on a project that will remain quiet until I am finished (sometime during the middle of this summer -- probably late June or July).

Google is celebrating with their once again revised logo...   urlLink Take a look .Happy St. Patrick's Day everyone!My love for TechTV oficially ended today at about 3:45...  Leo Laporte has officially announced his resignation of lead-host of  The Screen Savers , a "geek-powered" show made originally by geeks for geeks.  After hearing about ComCast's acquisition of TechTV from Vulcan Enterprises, Inc. I realized that the network would never be the same, but I never thought it would force the network's best host out of his position.  Leo says that he will remain host of  Call For Help until further notice, but will take on a "diminished" role in TSS.  Within 90 days the ComCast acquisition will be official and ComCast will have complete control over the company.  Comcast has also announced that they will be merging the entire TechTV network with  G4 , a Comcast channel dedicated solely to gaming and the gamer's lifestyle.  Somehow, none of this surprises me...  After TPTB cut back on TSS' on-air time from 90 minutes (1hr 30 min) to 60 minutes (1 hr), there was outrage in the TechTV community.  After that decision was made, the viewing audience dropped out by at least 40%.  I have remained a TechTV fan up until this point.  In fact, I was a fan at the very beginning (when the network was called ZDTV).  I have been a fan from the  very first episode of TSS when Leo was hosting the show with Kate Botello (who has now left the company).  From this point onward, I cannot remain a true TechTV fan.  I will not remain a part of an organization or community that allows such things to happen.  TechTV has been a major part of my geek-life.  I have been a TechTV / ZDTV fan now for 6 years (from beginning until now).  TechTV performance and show quality has dropped off a lot in the past 2 to 3 years.  Leo left Call For Help and Chris Pirillo joined the company, The Screen Savers was reduced to a meager 60 minutes, TechLive became a major part of the network, Leo became more "commercial" in his activities with TechTV, Kate Botello left the network and Patrick Norton was made replacement for her; and the list gets longer and longer as I think about all of the horrible things that have happened to this once wonderful network over the past few years.  I will continue to post updates about the merger, but I will no longer be an active fan of the network if things like this are continually allowed to happen.  We must put a stop to this...I watched The Passion today...  It was EXCELLENT.  It was much better than I thought it would be...Just a test post from w.bloggar........That's right!

G4 CEO, Charles Hirschcorn fired the  entire  TechTV San Francisco staff last night.  By firing all employees in the San Francisco (headquarters) sector, he will be allowing only 100 positions to come back ONLY for people willing to relocate to the new G4 + TechTV headquarters in Los Angeles, CA.

TechTV has been my ONLY resource for satisfying my technology needs for the past 5 to 6 years.  Now it's all gone.Currently, I am working on what seems to be the beginnings of a talk radio show.   urlLink Nick  and I will be working on this internet radio show early this summer and hope to have it running for the rest of the summer.  So, if you're curious, here's how I'm doing the test version right now...  I'm running PeerCast as a radio client which allows me to open a channel on port 7144 (supposedly internet radio).  Then, I have SHOUTcast and Winamp running in the background as my DSP (which collects sound to transmit).  Overall, I find this pretty neat, but there are still a few bugs to be worked out.  If you want to listen in on some of the test work being done, go over to peercast.org and click on talk radio.... We should be up there somewhere if we haven't pulled down for configuration...   UPDATE:  Right now we are DOWN because of a few minor bugs, but we should be back for some more testing tomorrow night...  I am going to dedicate the Tech Help blog that I have to show notes - Stay tuned!So... I'm working on the site...  go over to justinwallace.tk  I've got both designs up right now  Not turning out like I wantgo to justinwallace.tk to see what's going onMay 28th is the day that G4 will official merge with TechTV  New website is g4techtv.comOnly 14 days of official school left for me....Really!  I really love blogger.... I'm addicted now that it has its new lookTHANK YOU SO MUCH GOOGLE!  I absolutely LOVE the new Blogger...Well, I finished early...  go  urlLink here! .I just want to say this... I  have  given Windows Media Player 9 Series a decent chance.  But, nevertheless,  I despise it with a passion .  Really... I don't like it at all.  Not only does it interfere with my configuration here, but it crashes  all   the   time .  Has anyone else experienced constant crashing with 9?  If so, drop me an  urlLink email , or just leave a comment.  Although I really love Winamp, I have recently gotten very tired of it (even though I do host my  urlLink radio  station with it).  As an alternative to both of these, I use Real Player Alternative (more properly known as "Classic Media Player").  I love it -- it's simple in design, but does it's job very well.  Not only does it act as a substitute for RealOne's wretched player, but it can also play MP3s, OGG files, and WMA (Windows Media) files.  It also has an excellent system of codecs for streaming radio.  If you are interested in getting Real Alternative (Classic Media Player), you can get it  urlLink here .  This is a direct-download link so you won't be confronted with the maker's site.  They also have an excellent Quick Tiime alternative  urlLink here .    I'm currently listening to " urlLink Word of God Speak " by MercyMe.I got an  urlLink Xanga  account, and, just as I thought, worth nothing.  Here's my review of Xanga service:  Xanga offers several different "web-community" features such as the ability to give reviews of other people's "Xanga Sites".  My only favorite feature is a service called "eprops" which are a form of rating system that allow you to give a token to a particular post showing how you value it (2 eprops - liked, to 0 - disliked).  Overall, Xanga really doesn't offer that much.  It offers a pitiful comments system, awful templates, and a horrible url system (the format is http://xanga.com/users/namegoeshere).  whereas blogger's is short and easily managed (the format is namegoeshere.blogspot.com).  When you use Xanga, you feel claustrophobic, and that's the only way I know of describing it.  People, go with Blogger -- you'll be much happier -- I promise.    Now, it's my turn to be mean (since Nick has had his  urlLink turn ).  My cousin,  urlLink Rachel , is an avid Xanga user and flaunts her disgraceful love for  urlLink it  and animosity toward  urlLink Blogger .  Xanga is for wimps.... sorry, Rachel.I recently saw the latest filmatic feat by Michael Moore, "Bowling for Columbine."  Simply amazing.I'm now finding myself at my "mid-college" crisis, but am thankful that the end of the semester is here.  I'm finding that making life decisions isn't really my forte, and would rather hop aimlessly from opportunity to opportunity, whenever it knocks, but I know that I'll probably change my mind by tomorrow...Love sucks...and so do girls.    "EVE WAS FRAMED."   I recall the very first time I saw this bumper sticker on my way to campus one day, and I thought to myself,  "Gee, I wonder if this girl ever gets tired watching all the people she sees in her rearview mirror roll their eyes?"   Eve, my friends, was not framed, she swallowed the apple whole. Core. Seeds. Stem. And, I bet she loved it.  She probably devoured the apple faster than that finicky freak of a monkey-boy Chris Kattan plays on Saturday Night Live.  I recently received in an e-mail this bit of information:   Anyway, I also wanted to apologize for being so distant with you recently. I  did suddenly start dating someone more seriously lately, and it is such that I  probably won't be dating anyone else for the time being. So, I suppose I was  just being unnecessarily awkward in bringing it up. Sorry about that. I don't  even know whether you care all that much. However, I hope that it won't prevent  us from contunuing to get to know each other because I think you're a cool cat,  John. I really do...in fact, I have found very few people in my life  that I can identify with as well as with you, spiritually and otherwise. That's  important to me. So, in hopes of not losing that, I'm very glad that we've  arranged something where we can see each other regularly and not once in a blue  moon. You dig?       Well, I don't dig...and I did care.  I guess I'll survive.Now, I've only been watching racing closely since the start of this season. All throughout my life though, my grandfather has been a big fan, so I've been around it enough to know most of the legendary names and some not-so-legendary ones from the late 80s/early 90s.   Jimmie Johnson's performance in last night's Coca-Cola 600 was by far the most dominating performance I've seen. Like I said, that's not saying much, but from what I've read, that was the type of race that you don't see too often.  Johnson was fast at the beginning of the race, fast in the middle of the race, and fast at the end. New tires, old tires - didn't seem to matter all that much. Despite a rash of cautions and subsequent restarts in the last 75 laps or so, Johnson kept pulling away from the field. It was like he was shot out of a cannon each time.   I came away quite impressed. And it seems that a lot more people, who are a lot more NASCAR-savvy, agree.Yeah, I know, this is a day later than usual. No - I haven't been sulking or trying to avoid having to mention this. It's been a busy Memorial Day weekend for me, and this is actually my first time with a chance to do some writing.  Game 3 was pretty intense, complete with star forwards Vinny Lecavalier and Jarome Iginila battling in a 1st period fight. After a great scoring chance for Brad Richards on a short-handed breakaway in the 2nd, the Flames' Chris Simon was able to push a rebound home to score the first goal of the game. Less than 2 minutes later, the 2nd goal went in, and the Lightning found themselves in a big hole. The Flames were able to clamp down defensively, much like they did in Game 1, and took a 2-1 lead in the series.   There's really not that much to say about it. I thought both teams looked pretty even before the scoring began, and the bounces seemed to go Calgary's way, and they pulled out the victory. Tonight's Game 4 is critical for the Bolts, because it's pretty hard to beat any team three games in a row. let alone a scrappy, resilient team like the Flames.  On a sidenote, I went to a party Saturday night, and I got my first experience of sports in HD, watching the game there. A couple of points:  - The picture was impressively sharp. However, I don't see this as being the revolution that I've heard so many people call it. I do love the widescreen, but again, it's not something I can't live without. Is the picture better than a non-HD tv? Yeah, but in my opinion, it isn't so much better that it was worth the $8-9 grand that people were spending to upgrade to it a couple of years ago. I'll wait a couple years for prices to come down and more programming to become accessible before I even consider lobbying to my wife for the upgrade.  - I've also read many a columnist proclaim that HD will save hockey on TV. Well, I don't see that either. Yeah, you get a little more of the playing surface onscreen, but that's about it. And it's really not even that much extra. Maybe an extra 3-4 feet of ice on each side. Big deal. The extra clarity of the picture isn't adding anymore to hockey than it would any other sport, movie, TV show, etc. Nothing makes it easier to follow the puck (the #1 complaint about TV hockey, from what I've seen), or see the plays develop better. You still miss the checks behind the action - not even the widescreen is wide enough to catch all of those. If the NHL is counting on HD to save its ridiculously miniscule ratings, then I think it's in for a big surprise.Following up on my promise last week, I fully intend to make this a weekly feature...  It's Memorial Day weekend, the unofficial start to summer, and the sports calendar is filling up. Tonight's schedule is fairly light (as Friday nights usually are), but I will once again plug TBS' Friday Night Xtra. Last week's guest Dale Murphy did a fine job in the booth, but this week TBS welcomes a former icon for the Braves' host this weekend - Philly slugger Greg Luzinski. With the Bull in the booth, and a highly anticpated matchup on the field, this is definitely a game worth watching for baseball fans.  The NBA Playoffs continue tonight as well, with Game 4 of the Eastern Conference Finals on ESPN. I actually was keeping an eye on Game 3 Wednesday night while I was out, and that first half was painful to watch. I was quickly reminded why I don't follow the NBA too closely anymore. Does anyone actually think either of these teams could beat the Lakers? Well, needless to say, I don't consider this prime viewing unless you're a glutton for punishment.  Saturday will give you plenty of choices for viewing, depending on your sports of choice. FOX has Saturday baseball, which means the Braves-Phillies on a different network (wow, so glad to have this regional coverage - someone please remind the FOX folks that we can all see our regional teams every day anyway).   With the weekend, NBC takes over coverage of the French Open, which means tape-delayed action (get excited)! I just don't get it - will that many more people watch taped coverage at noon than watch live coverage beginning at 9:00? I'll probably just check the internet to find out who won, and watch the baseball game instead.  Saturday night, it's a choice between Game 5 of the Lakers-T'Wolves series on TNT, or Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals on ABC. I'm betting that NBA game will be interesting, because the league really needs to get as many games out of the Lakers as they can right now - they are keeping the ratings afloat. My hunch is that Minnesota wins Game 5 and at least sends gives TNT one more game. Meanwhile, the NHL heads north to Canada for Game 3, and after last night, this series is definitely up for grabs.  Sunday will have plenty to offer. The day begins early, French Open coverage at 11:00 on NBC (they may actually have a chance to show some live coverage, but I wouldn't count on it). Over on ABC, the green flag at the Indy 500 drops at noon ET, kicking off the marathon day of auto racing.  There's also the usual baseball games Sunday afternoon, as well as golf. The PGA guys are in Memphis for the FedEx St. Jude, but it's a pretty weak field again. If John Daly's in contention, maybe it's worth a look, but otherwise I'll pass. The Seniors are in Louisville for the Senior PGA Championship, so there could be some interesting happenings on NBC.  After a short break, get ready for Sunday night. FOX kicks things off with the Coca-Cola 600 at 5 pm. NASCAR's longest race will be racing well into the night, hopefully without any weather delays that have popped up frequently over the past several years.  There's also Game 5 of the Pacers-Pistons series at 8:00 on ESPN, as well as Sunday Night Baseball (Dodgers-Diamondbacks) on ESPN2.  There you have it, sports fans - the highlights of this weekend's action on the tube. I'll be trying my best to spread my viewing out, but to me the only can't-miss action is the Coke 600. This is one of NASCAR's best races each year, and was the first race I ever watched from start to finish. That was in 1995, and I've been hooked on the sport since. For that, it gets my pick of the weekend.The Lightning proved once again that they are capable of bouncing back like an experienced, mature team, moving to 5-0 after loss in the 2004 playoffs. Despite a sluggish start to the Stanley Cup Finals, the Tampa Bay Lightning played an inspired Game 2, evening the series at one game apiece.   The difference between the first two games is that the Lightning came out energetic and inspired from the very beginning.  urlLink C Vinny Lecavalier  played a ferocious 1st period, throwing checks and spectacularly assisting on the first goal. On that assist, Vinny was being pursued behind the net by a Calgary skater. He purposely bounced the puck off the back of the net to pass it to himself, did a sharp 360, recovered the puck while the Calgary player flew out of the play, passed it back out into open ice, and shortly thereafter, Ruslan Fedotenko shuffled the puck in off of a rebound.  The 1st period was also characterized by a flurry of penalties, many of which were questionable at best. Dmitry Afanasenkov was called for boarding, when his momentum carried him into a Flame that touched up an icing call. Minutes later, a Calgary player did the same thing to a Lightning player touching up - no call.   But in all reality, it seemed that those penalites helped the Bolts. Calgary had a total of 4 power plays in the 1st period, but were unable to even come close to converting one of them into a goal. The Lightning penalty kill continues its brilliant play throughout the playoffs. And I think it swung momentum into Tampa Bay's favor. The Flames could get nothing going, and that's deflating, while the Lightning and the crowd were getting more and more confidence as each penalty expired.  By not falling behind early, the Lightning were able to keep Calgary from pinching down hard on defense. In fact, as the 3rd period rolled around, the Flames had to put more effort into scoring the equalizer, which helped open up the ice for the Bolts, resulting in 3 3rd period goals.   The series shifts to Calgary Saturday night, where the Flames haven't been spectacular. They're only 4-5 at home so far, while the Lightning have gone 5-2 on the road. It should be a wild atmosphere, being the first Stanley Cup Finals game in Canada since 1993. It should be a great game, one that may set the tone for the rest of the series.It used to be that the mention of Memorial Day weekend in the sports world brought visions of one thing: The Brickyard. But as we approach the unofficial kickoff to summer, there's been hardly a peep about this year's Indianapolis 500. Despite the fact that the IRL has pretty much killed off the rival CART series for good, the open-wheel set has fallen far, far behind stock car racing on the American sports scene. There are no real "stars" on the IRL series anymore - the best racers now migrate to NASCAR or even Formula 1 when the opportunity arises, and the fans have followed (at least to NASCAR).  This Sunday will once again be the biggest day of the year in auto racing, but it's the Coca-Cola 600 that will likely steal the show. NASCAR's longest race, held on the "home" track for most of its teams, has become one of the biggest race events of the year. It will probably never achieve the fame of Indy or Daytona, but the 600 will likely be watched by a similar number of people thanks to its cushy time slot on Sunday evening before the Monday holiday.  As for Indy, it will be noted in the Monday papers who this year's winner was, but within a week the IRL will again be forgotten. Race fans will once again be back at NASCAR, which will bring its brand of racing to the hallowed grounds at Indy later this summer. In fact, Indianapolis will once again continue as the premier racing facility in the world, thanks to its hosting of the Formula 1 US Grand Prix in June.   With such a schedule, Indianapolis Motor Speedway is the only place in the world to host events from the biggest three series in racing. Of course, many people would probably disagree with that statement now - they would say that Indy hosts races from the two biggest series, along with another race that originally made the place famous.The NBA Lottery was held last night. A few notes:  1) Why do they always hold this during the conference finals? I've never understood this. Let's give NBA fans something to think about and speculate on while four teams battle it out for a place in the Finals. Granted, you can't push the lottery back till after the Finals, because the draft is just a couple weeks after that. But why not put it on during the 1st round of the playoffs? You've still got 16 sets of teams' fans interested in the playoffs then, and you give the other 14 teams' fans something to talk about as well. It just seems so counterproductive to take the spotlight off of the teams that are still in it, and put it on the dregs of the league, and in the case of the Clippers, the dregs of all of American sport.   2) Did the Magic really 'win' anything? I'd hate to have the 1st pick in the NBA these days. The yearly high school exodus has made it a very tenuous position. High school players are such risks. You've never seen them against college-caliber talent, let alone professional-caliber talent. You could be getting an  urlLink Amare Stoudemire , or maybe a  urlLink Kwame Brown .  Think about some of the other stud high school players to come out pre-Garnett. Remember  urlLink Felipe Lopez ? The all-world guard who would resurrect St. John's basketball program? With all the hype surrounding him, he probably would have been no worse than a lottery pick, very likely in the top 5 or 6, in today's current atmosphere. But what happened between then and now? Lopez was a good, but not spectacular college player. He was a late-1st Rd pick, bounced around with the Grizzlies, Wizards, and T-Wolves, hasn't been in the league since 2002, and has a career scoring avg of 5.8 in 249 games. Not exactly worth the investment required.   3) The 'experts' are calling this a very weak draft, on the heels of a very strong one in 2003. Magic fans and media expecting another LeBron James or Carmelo Anthony are going to be disappointed. And that, my friends, is when heads start to roll. Going with the safe pick, they could get Emeka Okafor, who reminds me of Ben Wallace with a just a little bit more offense. Then, you run the risk of passing on a Garnett or Jermaine O'Neal-type who needed the time to develop. Or they can turn to a high school player, none of whom are going to be ready to provide a LeBron/Carmelo-type impact, and could very well turn into another Eddy Curry.   If I'm in the Orlando Magic front office, I'm on the horn trying desperatley to trade this pick. It's worth more to another GM who is willing to take these risks. And I'm not one who would.The city famed for its fortified aged wine has something to celebrate tonight, as FC Porto added the Champions League trophy to their collection.  The Portuguese champions' 3-0 defeat of Monaco completed the rare feat of winning the UEFA Cup (Europe's #2 competition) in one year and following it up with the Champions League title the next.  Porto took down Monaco with the same tactical skills that felled giants like Manchester United in earlier rounds. The constantly baited Monaco into their offsides trap, held stoutly in defense, and carefully chose their moments for attack.   After a somewhat slow start, Porto broke through with a goal minutes before the end of the first half. With the lead, they were now free to pack in the back and make life miserable for Fernado Morientes and the rest of Monaco's attack.  Moments after a failed Monaco corner midway through the second half, Porto broke out on a counterattack that was executed to perfection. Breaking from their own half, Porto skillfully played the ball from the inside to the flank, then back across where Deco calmly settled, then fired a shot into the back of the net. It was 2-0, and pretty much over. The Portuguese side would add a 3rd goal moments later for the final margin.  For Portuguese fans, this is likely a sweet moment - their nation is preparing to host the European Championship next month, and they will hope that the triumph by their club champion can be followed by a similar performance from a national side that has teased but disappointed on an international stage over the past several years. With many of those national players now owning the medals of Europe's club championship, that is entirely possible.Good news for fellow Cub fans. Looks like Mark Prior isn't having any setbacks. If he does make that start Sunday at Iowa, it might be his last on the rehab assignment. He's eligible to come off the 60-day DL June 3rd, and he could start against the Pirates in that weekend series. It's great timing, with Wood down for another couple of weeks.   While there's not much good about having your franchise pitcher out with an injury, maybe the silver lining is the reduced fatigue on Prior's arm. I'm not the first one to suggest this, but perhaps Prior will benefit by not having as many tiresome innings by the time September and, hopefully, October roll around. We've all seen how Dusty Baker likes to ride his starting pitchers' arms.Calgary came into the St. Pete Times Forum for Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals, fresh and chased down puck after puck, creating turnovers and scoring opportunities. They killed penalties efficiently, and even set up multiple shorthanded breakaways including a backbreaking short-handed goal in the 2nd period.  Sounds familiar to Lightning fans, eh?  These two teams play a very similar style of hockey. They capitalize on forechecking. They rely on transition scoring opportunities. They have tons of speed.  And when you get two good teams who play similar styles in any sport, the team that works harder usually wins. And that's what happened. There's no other way to say it - the Lightning got flat outhustled last night.   Luckily, the Lightning did show flashes of brilliance, getting several prime chances, but Calgary G Miikka Kiprusoff was on his game, keeping all but one of those out of the net.  The Bolts didn't look like they were ready for the defensive pressure that Calgary brought to the table. G Nikolai Khabibulin misplayed several pucks behind the net with Calgary skaters streaking in towards him. He was very lucky to have not given up another goal on some of those.  Obviously, Game 1 was a letdown for Tampa Bay, but a lot of people expected it after a very emotional and hardfought Game 7 with the Flyers. Let's see if they can come out with more energy Thursday night before we start making judgements. Thus far in the playoffs, they've been able to follow a disappointing outing with a focued, inspired one. So Game 2 will be the proverbial litmus test. I think John Tortorella will make sure he gets this team back on track.Tomorrow, one of the biggest games of the year takes place, but it will receive little more than a quick moment on SportsCenter. Across the Atlantic, Europe's equivalent of the Super Bowl will be contested in the city of Gelsinkirchen, Germany (home of German soccer club Schalke 04).  The UEFA Champions League final is the ultimate match in European club soccer, and throughout the continent life will stand still for two hours, beginning at 8:45 CET (2:45 pm here in the Eastern time zone of the US). FC Porto and AS Monaco will battle to determine who is the best team in all of Europe, a tremendous honor. While getting to the Super Bowl requires grinding through 16 regular season games to be one of the top 12 teams out of 30, then winning two or three playoff games, getting to the Champions League final requires much, much more.  First, these two sides had to qualify for this year's event by placing near the top of their national leagues in 2002-2003 (that usually means being #1 or #2 in a league of 18). Then, these sides had to navigate a six-match round robin phase against other top sides, followed by three home-and-away series against the other top survivors. What makes this year's finalists so amazing is that neither one was expected to be anywhere near here - despite being from two top soccer-playing nations, these are upper-tier teams from mid-level leagues.   What Monaco and Porto have done is take down the larger, wealthier, more famous clubs in Europe with a brand of soccer that's not always entertaining, but is the embodiment of teamwork. They are the two survivors from a competition that essentially stretched over two years and involved hundreds of teams. Tomorrow, one of them will be rewarded with a place in history.  I know most people don't have the opportunity to watch TV on weekday afternoons, but I'd urge those that do to take this opportunity to see what much of the world considers their biggest annual match. I won't get quite the experience I had last year, when I got to watch the final from an Irish Pub in the city of Lyon, France, along with a roaring crowd of mainly Italians (two Italian sides actually met in the last year's game). Regardless, I'll be watching from work, anxious to see what happens in Europe's Big One.One of the perks of my job is that we have TV's in the office, so that means I am able to catch daytime sporting events quite often. A few minutes ago, I flipped over to ESPN2's French Open coverage to see the latest from Paris, and to my dismay I saw Venus Williams. As is customary in the opening round of the women's draw at a Grand Slam, Venus was facing a vastly inferior opponent and already up early in the match - not the most riveting television.   Now here's the kicker: Not only is ESPN choosing to show us this slaughter, but it's not even live! I already know that Venus ran past Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-2, 6-4, because I have internet access. I also know that Tommy Haas has taken the first set from defending champ Juan Carlos Ferrero in the best match of the opening round. That match is going on right now (check the link for all the lives scores), but ESPN apparently thinks we'd rather see Venus' earlier romp over the top women's player from Thailand.   I know that Americans will root for American athletes, and we need American stars for the sport to be popular here. But in this day and age, showing taped coverage instead of live coverage is just plain stupid, especially when it's not even a worthy match. Hopefully ESPN will eventually listen to all the complaints from tennis fans, and give us some matches worth watching. Here's a helpful hint to the guys in Bristol - check out the new Tennis Channel during non-Grand Slam events and you'll see the coverage we wantI didn't watch the Pistons-Pacers game last night, but I saw the highlights, specifically the bigtime block that Tayshaun Prince got on what would have been a game-tying layup for Reggie Miller. Miller's post-game quote: "I saw him in my rearview mirror. In hindsight, I should have dunked it, but I thought I had a few steps on him."   Couple of points on this:  1) How ironic is it that he 'should have' dunked it? How many times do you see someone blow a dunk and you think to yourself, "Man, he shoulda just layed it up." Happens to me all the time. Last night, Reggie went for the layup and he says he should have dunked it. Which brings me to my next point....  2) Can Reggie Miller even dunk anymore? He was never much of a leaper, and he's 38 now. Although I can't remember ever seeing him do it, I'm sure he could back in the Spike Wars days. I dunno, I haven't watched enough NBA over the last 4-5 years, but it just doesn't sound right. And if he can dunk nowadays, I gotta think it still isn't easy for him - otherwise he would have done it without thinking last night. So, if he has trouble getting above the rim, then I still think the layup is the right shot, because it'd be much worse if he clanged it. With the layup, he at least forced Prince to make a pretty athletic play.That's the official attendance number from Montreal last night, where the Braves shut out the Expos. Of the many, many reasons I despise Bud Selig, his handling of the Expos has truly been an embarrassment for baseball. This franchise has now sunk to its lowest lows (no real home, no fans, and a truly horrendous team on the field). MLB execs promise that we will get an offical announcement on the team's ultimate destination by July, but is there any reason I should believe them at this point? I truly hope they are telling the truth this time, because what we are seeing right now in Montreal both in the stands and on the field is truly shameful.Not good news today... Kerry Wood will miss at least another 3 weeks after feeling discomfort again yesterday.   It's actually pretty impressive what the Cubs have been able to do with all of the injuries they've suffered. The Angels have gotten a lot of attention for what they've been able to do, despite a glut of injuries. But take note of the Cubs' woes. There's Wood, Mark Prior hasn't pitched, Sammy Sosa sneezed his back out of whack, and Mark Grudzielanek, Alex Gonzalez, Mike Remlinger, and Kent Mercker have all hit the DL. And yet, the Cubs took 2 of 3 in a weekend series with the Cardinals to remain in a tie for 1st place in the NL Central. Who woulda thunk it?  Now, Lee can attest to my preseason prediction of the Wild Card for the Cubs, with the Astros winning the division. But if they can keep up this pace without their stars, then I may have underestimated them (happily). Wood, Prior, and Sosa should all be back by mid-June, just in time for the stretch run.It looks like the Raiders are less than sure that QB Rich Gannon is going to be as effective as he was in 2002. As they close in on signing Kerry Collins to a contract, there's a very good possibility that they will let Gannon, who has already refused to take a pay cut, go.  So, with a questionable shoulder and no guarantee that his skills haven't eroded a great deal, the 2002 MVP will be forced to look for a new team. Former coach Jon Gruden and the Buccaneers are sure to be first on his list. And Gruden and Bruce Allen will actually consider it, and might even go ahead and do it.  Gannon and Gruden are cut from the same mold. Gruden has never had a quarterback understand his offense as well as Gannon. Gannon has never had a coach who used his talents more successfully. They're both workaholics and have keen attention to detail in their exhaustive preparations.   Memo to Jon Gruden: You've already got a pretty good quarterback. His name is Brad Johnson. All he's done since he got to the Bucs is average 3,400 passing yds per season and help win a Super Bowl. You spent all of last year praising Johnson, telling everyone on the record that he's your guy.   Despite all of the public rhetoric to the opposite, there has to be something to this lack of cohesion between Gruden and Johnson. There have been far too many whispers and rumors regarding their relationship for none of it to be unfounded. The reality is, though, that Johnson has been a pretty decent quarterback. Plus, he doesn't have Gannon's bum shoulder.  So what gives? Does anybody really think that Gruden would bring Gannon in as a backup, especially after already signing Brian Griese earlier in the offseason? Does anybody think that Gannon would sign if he knew he was gonna be a backup?   Gruden is known for wanting to sign any player that comes along on the waiver wire. It's what drove Rich McKay out of town, but this is ridiculous. Here's to hoping that Gruden and Allen show a little restraint.  (Note: I don't plan on everything I write for this site to be based on Tampa-area teams. I promise to work on some less Florida-centric stuff soon.)Well, it's just after 10 am in the East on the first day of the French Open, and already the most popular American men's player is gone. Andre Agassi has stumbled out of Paris way too quickly, and now the questions will certainly be coming. Is Andre about to join his old friend/rival Pete Sampras in retirement?   I was always a Sampras guy, but I do admire Andre for the way he has resurrected his career not once, but twice. He's carried on at the top of the tennis world far longer than anyone else in recent history (by 34, most top players have long since faded into oblivion, whether retired or hanging on as a shell of their former selves). But Andre has been here still, helping carry the tennis torch in the US until Andy Roddick and the next generation of players could step up. Roddick has so far (hopefully he can beat one of Agassi's peers, Todd Martin, in their opener later today), but no one else has yet.   Tennis is probably the most popular "international" sport in the US. However, it needs strong American talent to keep it that way and Andre has been that talent in the men's game for many, many years. I'm afraid that today's defeat may be the sign that Andre's days as a top-10 player are winding down, but hopefully he still has one last great run at Flushing Meadows ready for this September - it would be a final treat for the legions of fans that have followed the highs and lows of one of tennis' most memorable careers.You better believe that I was glued to the TV Saturday night for Game 7 between the Lightning and Flyers. It was a great game and the Bolts prevailed, so I'm not at all disappointed with it. Both teams gave everything they had, and it was a nail-biting experience.   The Lightning gained redemption after their collapse in Game 6. If you'll recall in that game, the Lightning entered the 3rd period with a one-goal lead. But they played not to lose by being content to dump the puck deep into the Philadelphia zone and never try to keep possession of it nor attack the net. Yep, Tampa Bay had mostly controlled the action in the first two periods, and now they were going to sit on a lead, a  one-goal  lead. And that strategy worked - for eighteen and a half minutes. The Flyers, after getting a steady stream of scoring opportunities throughout the period, finally got a puck in the net with 98 seconds left in the game. The hometown crowd went nuts, and the Flyers carried that momentum into the overtime period, dominated it like they did the 3rd period and scored to force a Game 7.   So, fast forward to Saturday night, and guess what - the Lightning enter the 3rd period with a very vulnerable one-goal lead. The Flyers have their backs against the wall once again. The Lightning coaches and players claimed they'd learned their lesson from Game 6 and wouldn't get away from their style of play if they had a late lead. And they didn't. In the 3rd period, the Lightning did exactly what they were supposed to do - they turned up the heat on the Flyers. They got more physical, checking with more ferocity. They pushed the puck into their offensive zone, getting more shots on goal than their opponents in the 3rd. They didn't let the Flyers tee off on G Nikolai Khabibulin, fighting ferociously to dig the puck out of the corner and get an odd-man rush going.   They played like a team on a mission.   One more thing. You gotta feel good for a guy like  urlLink Dave Andreychuk . 22 years in the league, 634 goals, 1,320 points. And he's getting his first chance to play for the Stanley Cup. And the refreshing thing is that he refuses to make this a personal triumph. Whenever anyone has asked him about it, he always brushes it aside and reiterates that the team as a whole has earned the accomplishment through their hard work. He also makes sure to note that the ultimate goal hasn't been accomplished yet.   And believe me, he won't let the other guys on the team forget it. I've never been a big believer in the extreme importance of 'chemistry' for a championship team. But having a guy like Dave Andreychuk has been good for the Bolts. He's taught the younger guys, like Vinny Lecavlier and Brad Richards, what it takes to win night in and night out. And he's been a strong, vocal leader - John Tortorella's own coach out on the ice. While he'll never admit it, he means a lot more to this team than his statistics will imply.   Dave, this couldn't happen to a more deserving player. Good luck in the Finals.You could say that I'm a hockey newbie. Living in Florida my entire life, I can obviously attest to not being around a lot of hockey.   I really started watching it during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. With real-life All-Star teams made up of players that actually tried to win (unlike typical all-star games), I got wrapped up in it. I got a chance to learn the game a little then, and since then, I've learned a lot more, like different strategies and the like.   The NHL Playoffs are great fun. They're really gripping and intense. And with my hometown Tampa Bay Lightning in the Eastern Conference Finals, you could say I'm a little 'Cup Crazy' right now. The Bolts and Philadelphia Flyers played Game 6 of that series last night, with the Flyers winning in OT to force a Saturday Game 7 in Tampa.   Now, if you've never watched playoff hockey before, to say that the referees are really lax late in games would be a gross understatement. During last night's overtime, anarchy was the theme. A cross-check here - no whistle. Somebody gets tripped there - no whistle. Little slashing everywhere - guess what, no whistle. The players knew there would be no repercussions, and they took advantage of that.  Both teams were guilty of the infractions, but as a fan of sports in general, I just don't know how this has become acceptable officiating. Everytime a player would get possession of the puck, and a little steam built up, next thing you know he's basically tackled from behind. If that happens in a regular season game, it's two minutes in the box. But not in the playoffs.  Look, I understand that you never want a referee's call to decide the outcome of a game. But is that really worse than a game of rugby breaking out on the ice? Why should a game be called differently in different circumstances? It's the equivalent of football officials telling the players, "We're only gonna call offsides for the rest of the game, guys. Everything else goes." Could you imagine that? Every wide receiver would get laid out before the quarterback gets to step #2 in a 5-step drop. What about basketball? If there's a 2-on-1 fast break, the lone defender needs to just clothesline the ballhandler. Would fans accept that? Would the players?  But in hockey, its anything goes. Look, if you need to hook a guy like Jaromir Jagr to keep the game-winning goal from scoring, then by all means do it. But you should also pay the price for that. And if you can hold on during that power play, then it was a good decision. But if you can't, then that's the risk you take.  A ref making a call isn't what's determining the outcome of the game. The player's decision to commit the offense is.   The NHL needs to re-examine the way their officials are enforcing the rules in these games, and require them to follow the rulebook no matter what period it is. It makes for a more exciting and more tactical game. They owe it to the fans.Since it's late Friday afternoon, I thought I'd give a rundown of some of what I'll be watching this weekend. Maybe we'll make this a weekly feature.  Tonight, I'll be watching the Braves-Dodgers game on TBS. I could go to the game, but I actually would prefer to watch this one on TV. If you haven't watched TBS for a Friday night game yet, check it out - they're doing some pretty neat stuff (and some not so neat) for their "Braves Friday Night Xtra." Well, tonight's highlight for me will be guest commentator Dale Murphy, former Brave great. Murph was my favorite player growing up, and remains I guy I really admire. He's losing steam on the Hall of Fame ballot, which is a shame, because he's exactly the type of great character guy the Hall supposedly honors. Anyway, Murph's a whole story for another day, so I'll save it for then.  There's also NBA action tonight, with Game 1 of the Western Conference Finals. The Lakers have advanced to play the Timberwolves, led by MVP Kevin Garnett. Think the NBA and their broadcast partners were relieved at that matchup? The East will be a snoozer, but at least they will get some viewers for this series. I'm not really an NBA guy though, so I probably won't watch too much. But it's there for all you NBA fans who have somehow persevered through the slowest early rounds in the history of pro sports playoffs.  Tomorrow, FOX returns with the Saturday Game of the Week. My question is why do they wait until mid-May to do this? What have they been showing on Saturday afternoons for the past six weeks? On the plus side, it's six weeks that I haven't had to listen to Tim McCarver's idiodic commentary. Also, it's not really like it's that big of a thing for me - it just means that the Braves are on a different channel, because that's the game they will be showing. You know, most of the country already sees the Braves (and Cubs and Yankees as well) on a regular basis, so how about finding some different teams to show us, FOX?  Tomorrow night, it will be over to FX for the NASCAR Nextel All-Star Challenge. This is usually a pretty fun event, and you never know what's gonna happen (like two years ago, when a rain storm came just after the first wreck of the race and NASCAR decided to let the guys who wrecked get their cars fixed during the delay). It's also much shorter than the typical NASCAR race and full of action, so it's a great chance for non-NASCAR fans to check the sport out and see how it can be quite interesting. I highly recommend it.  There's also a hockey Game 7 tomorrow night. John I'm sure will be trying his best to watch his Lightning finish off the Flyers along with NASCAR. I'll let him discuss this more though if he wants, because I'm not really a hockey guy either.  NBA fans can again check out playoff action tomorrow night, with Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. But I'd have to guess you'd be a pretty hard-core fan to be looking forward to watching Detroit and Indiana slug it out. At least the West has some intruiging teams.  Sunday looks like a pretty slow day. Whatever happened to Sunday afternoons chock full of sports? Even the lone NBA playoff game of the day doesn't tip until 8:30. By then, it will be almost time for me to watch the Sopranos. Thankfully, things are really about to crank up for the big summertime events (Tennis and Golf are about to enter their summer run of majors, beginning with the French Open on Monday).  So what does Sunday afternoon offer? Well, there's baseball again (Braves-Dodgers on TBS), the final round of the PGA Colonial (no Tiger, no Vijay, no Ernie, no Phil, not much interest), and that's about it. How can Sunday afternoon be so empty? Guys, get some points by doing something productive Sunday afternoon, because you won't have many more weekend afternoons this barren on the sporting scene.  Well, that's about it for the weekend, sports fans. Like I said, we can all look forward to next week, as the French Open begins on Monday, the Stanley Cup Finals start Tuesday, and the NBA and MLB plug along. Oh, and one of Europe's biggest days on the sporting calendar is next week as well: the Champions League final, with Porto facing Monaco. More on all that next week.I'm Lee Geeker, co-author here with John. A native Floridian, I now live in Atlanta, GA. I'll go ahead and let you know that I'll likely be specializing in content pertaining to football (college), baseball, and NASCAR, as well as less publicized sports like soccer and tennis. Really though, I could pretty much come up with stuff on anything. Now let's get this show started...Well, this will be the first entry for our new blog, so I thought I should introduce who we are. Welcome to Sports Talk, a blog for the sports fan. My name is John Lill, and I live in Tampa, FL. My partner's name is Lee Geeker, and I'll let him introduce himself to you.   Our goal with this is to express our thoughts on various sports topics and more importantly, have a little fun. We hope you enjoy.In less than an hour, Portugal and the Netherlands will face off in the Euro 2004 semifinals. When the match is over one of these two nations will be on their way to the finals and will have pretty much shed the label of perrenial underachiever, which has been placed on both sides over the past decade.  The Dutch have won one European title (in 1988), but have consistently been labeled as one of the most talented international sides for the past 30 years. The faces constantly change, but there is always a new wave of talented youngsters ready to step up. Unfortunately, major international tournaments always seem to end in disappointment, including the 2000 tournament where the Dutch served as hosts.  Now, the Oranje will try to end the run of this year's tournament hosts, a side that boasts one of the biggest stars in the game in Luis Figo. Figo is one of several Portuguese players who were dubbed the "Golden Generation" when they won the FIFA Youth title several years ago. Unfortunately, despite all of the professional success of these players, they have yet to break through in international play. Now, with Figo and the others on the wrong side of 30, this is their final chance to prove how special their talents really are.  It's unfair to think that one team will be praised while the other is stuck with the underachiever label based solely on the outcome of one game, and perhaps just one goal. But that's the way it works sometimes in international soccer. Today, someone will step up and carry his country forward to the promised land - it should be fantastic to watch.When the Orioles played an exhibition series in Havana against the Cuban National Team a few years ago, I made a comment that startled my friends. During the game, ESPN cut to a shot of Bud Selig sitting with Fidel Castro and I remarked that if I were an assassin at that game, I'd shoot Bud and not Castro.  Now, I have softened on a few things Selig has done during his rule of baseball (ok, so maybe the wild cards were a good idea), but for the most part I still believe that the reign of Selig has been bad for baseball and that the man himself is a fast-talking con artist (not surprising for a guy who made his money as a car salesman).  Finally, someone has presented an in-depth portrait of some of Selig's doings over the past ten years or so, and it pretty much reaffirms my feelings on the man who runs baseball like a dictator.  I encourage any baseball fan to read this Washington Post series that details why the DC area may not get a Major League team anytime soon, and why they actually may not want one, given the conditions that will be imposed by his highness the Commissioner. (Note that free registration to the Post site is required to read - sorry about that).Just a few weeks ago it took plenty of effort to find Americans playing into the second week at the French Open, but the fortunes of the US contingent have changed dramatically thus far at Wimbledon.  Despite the upset defeat suffered by Venus Williams last week, American players on both sides fared quite well through the early rounds at the All-England club. On the men's side Andy Roddick has now been left to carry the flag, but compatriots Vince Spadea and Robby Ginepri both reached the fourth round before falling on Monday.  On the women's side, Serena Williams hasn't had the struggles of her sister and has to be considered the odds-on favorite to win another Wimbledon title. Wednesday however she will have to once again face off against Jennifer Capriati, who is looking for her first Wimbledon title. Along with those two, Lindsay Davenport has played as well as anyone and will be favored to defeat teen sensation Maria Sharapova in the semifinals. If that happens, there is a great chance of an all-American women's final.  Regardless, after all of the worry about the state of American tennis during the two weeks in Paris, the fortnight in England has shown that there are still plenty of solid American players in both competitions, and with the summer North American swing about to begin, these players will return home ready to show their own fans what they are capable of. If all goes well, it could be a fun summer for US tennis fans.I guess when you sign a contract to play professional sports in America, you've signed your life away. Hell, these days, you don't even have to sign the contract, as long as the team owns your rights.  Emeka Okafor was invited, and accepted, to become the 12th and final member of the 2004 USA men's basketball team. However, this doesn't sit too well with Charlotte Bobcats GM and coach Bernie Bickerstaff, who selected Okafor with the 2nd selection in last week's NBA Draft. Here are his thoughts:   We are somewhat concerned because all that basketball causes a lot of wear and tear and prevents you from being fresh at the start of the season. We have many concerns that we want to address.  OK, I understand that management is wary of Okafor wearing himself out, but let's be realistic here. Bickerstaff says that he'd rather Okafor work out with the coaching staff in Charlotte and play in summer league games. Well, will there really be any more basketball played by the Olympic team than by the proposed summer league games and workout schedule the Bobcats have planned for Okafor? If there is more, it's because Team USA will probably practice together a play a couple of exhibition games in the weeks leading up to the tournament. Besides, it doesn't matter what he does this offseason - Okafor will hit the wall regardless. And Okafor will be the most-rested player on the team. As of now, he hasn't played competitive basketball for almost 3 months.   Of course, in Bickerstaff's eyes, it'd be more beneficial for Okafor to work out and scrimmage with the castoffs that make up the expansion Bobcats roster, instead of working out with the best player in the NBA (Tim Duncan) and a group of All-Star-caliber players. Well, that's just plain ridiculous. I can't think of a better way to help your franchise player to adjust to the NBA than to have him post up and guard Duncan in practice. If I'm Bickerstaff, I'm encouraging it.  Not to mention the fact that Okafor isn't even Bickerstaff's employee yet! The Bobcats own the rights to sign him, but no contract has been completed. And it's his own time - it's not like he's opting to leave for Athens mid-season.  American sports teams attempt to control their players a great deal, much to the detriment of international competition. I have a feeling similar situations will occur when the baseball World Cup gets started either in 2005 or 2006. I have a hard time thinking that many MLB organizations are going to be excited about their pitchers playing hard in exhibition games. What if they get hurt? It could affect their chances at winning a World Series a great deal.   It has already happened in baseball, during the 2000 Olympics. Because the Summer Olympics fall not only during the MLB season, but also the most important time, the pennant stretch, major leaguers don't have the opportunity to play. But, for the first time that year, minor league players were selected to go, instead of college players. Problems arose. Some MLB clubs refused to allow their players be considered, including the Yankees. Some organzations demanded to know what role any of their potential players would play. They wanted to determine if they felt it was more beneficial for the club if the player just stayed at home. The most well-known instance involved the Cleveland Indians and LHP C.C. Sabathia. Team USA manager Tommy Lasorda wanted Sabathia on the team, but he didn't have a spot for him in the rotation. He figured Sabathia would be a great option in the bullpen. The Indians didn't like the sound of that. So they didn't allow Sabathia to participate.   American teams should take a look at the way European soccer works. Every star player (who is fit) played for their respective countries in the Euro 2004 tournament and qualfying rounds. Often, especially when World Cup qualifying heats up, clubs allow their players to miss league games to play for their national teams. Clubs aren't excited when something like that happens, but they allow it to happen, because qualifying for the World Cup means so much to each nation's federation (and FIFA will get involved if they don't). It's a matter of national pride, something that has been lacking amongst American clubs and athletes.   I can't blame many NBA players making up excuses for why they aren't willing to play in this year's Olympics. The security concerns in Greece justify some hestitation at least. American athletes' apathy when it comes to international competition is another story altogether. I think some of that mentality is fostered by their team's management, and that's really cheating non-American athletes from the opportunity to compete in a truly global event. Basketball and baseball need look at how great the World Cup and other international soccer tournaments are, how they promote the sport and generate interest in professional franchises. A little more commitment could go a long way.Now that I'm back, it's time for the return of the weekend TV guide. It's not a huge weekend of sports, certainly not like last weekend.  FOX has interleague baseball again this weekend featuring some of the top matchups. New Yorkers will get to watch the Yankees-Mets series, but thankfully FOX won't be showing that game to the entire country. Here in Atlanta, the Red Sox-Phillies game will be on, which should be a solid matchup.  Saturday's other big event is Wimbledon, with plenty of Americans still playing on both the men's and women's sides. ESPN and ESPN2 will have live coverage Saturday from 8 am to 3 pm.  For those that want something different, there's also Euro 2004 action, with Sweden taking on the Netherlands in what could be a very exciting encounter. The match starts at 2:45 EDT, so head down to your local pub to catch it.  Sunday, NASCAR takes on a different look with the road course race in Sonoma. For people the tire of watching cars make lots of left turns and drive in cricles, here's a chance to see the stock cars do something else.  Sunday's golf action will feature the final round of the Booz Allen Classic, which is lacking many of the big names after last weekend's grueling US Open.  Euro 2004 quarterfinal play also concludes Sunday with the Czech Republic (the tourney's only undefeated, untied team) taking on Denmark.  Finally, ESPN will give New Yorkers nationwide their fill of the Yankees and Mets with the final game of their weekend series Sunday night.  Overall, this weekend is a break from the last few weeks featuring playoff finals and major championships, but a strong slate of baseball helps make up some of the slack. But with July 4 coming next weekend, you know there will be plenty to watch then.Well, I have returned from Europe with a full case of Euro fever. Euro 2004 has been the biggest thing going the last two weeks for me, and my first day back in the States, I'm glued to the England-Portugal match.  So far, this year's tournament has been filled with the unexpected surprises, stunning upsets, and spectacular goals that make major tournament soccer so great. But what really sets it all apart is the fans. I managed to attend one match, Sweden's 5-0 thrashing of Bulgaria, and it was amazing. Swedish fans turned their corner of the stadium into a sea of yellow, with their chants ehoing loud and proud thoughout the match. The Bulgarians, though smaller in number, were a vocal bunch as well (at least until the rout was in full effect in the late stages of the game). There were also plenty of fans of other nations present, like me just happy to be in attendance.  Lisbon itself was great fun as well. The main areas downtown were filled each afternoon and night with fans of all the competing nations, out enjoying the sights in their team colors during the day. At night, fans crowded the outdoor restaurants singing and chanting their favorite tunes. It was as festive of an atmosphere as I have ever seen, and the fans all seemed to get along quite well, despite the reputations of soccer fans that we often hear about in the States.  I also visited the Euro 2004 Fan Park in Lisbon. Full of games and activities for everyone (and free to get in), it was another great gathering place for Europeans to gather and celebrate the sport they love. The biggest attraction was the giant TV screens that showed each match to those who couldn't make it to the stadium. The day I visited, we were able to watch the Germany-Netherlands match with thousands of fans from all over in a fun, festive atmosphere. With the chants of the German and Dutch fans decked out in their colors, it was almost like being at the game.  Overall, it was a phenomenal time. I came away with a greater regard for European soccer fans, and can't wait for the opportunity to join them again, this time with my own team to support. Without a doubt, I will be wearing the red, white, and blue in Germany two years from now, cheering on the USA and enjoying the great celebration of the World Cup.Ok, now that I know that people are actually checking out this site and NOT leaving comments (read the RED side panal: we thrive on comments!)...I'll have to put up a controversial issue and ask for all your opinions. By now, I'm sure that most of you (if not all) have heard about the woman who cloned herself and is going to raise this clone as her own daughter. Do you guys think this is ethical or dehumanizing? Right or wrong? Post your answers...ready...set....GO!So how was everyone's boxing day? For me, it was the usual...insanity and fast-paced. Michelle and I decided to go to Kingsway Mall and NOT West Edmonton Mall...because then that DEFINETLY will be either stupid or crazy or both (no offense). We were too scared to go! Kingsway Mall was pretty busy as well, but I'm sure not to the extent of WEM. I haven't been to Kingsway in over 2 years, so I've forgotten most of what it's like. There's actually many good stores in that mall (if you're a girl!). Miche and I were saying how boxing day is such a load of BS, because most of the so-called "sales" are not really "sales anyways. They just lower the price from a ridiculous amount to what it SHOULD be in the first place. Regardless, everyone, including us, gets suckered into the world of consumerism. Ce la vie, n'est pas? 

  Apparently, I'm not the only freak in my family to go crazy with boxing day this year. My parents FINALLY decided to come to their senses and buy TEN (yes -TEN!!!) selves for storage from Home Depot. Long story short, if you've been to my house, you know what I am talking about...my parents are pack-rats. They keep EVERYTHING. Not sure if that comes with being Chinese...but my parents even have newspapers OLDER than me. They are sitting in boxes in the den, untouched, becoming more fragile and old and yellower every second. Dad plans to read ALL of these papers when he retires. Hello dad, what about the internet? We've got junk everywhere and it urks me! I guess not enough that I'll actually jump in and organize everything myself (too much time that I don't have required). Practically half our house (not exaggerating) is occupied by unused boxes, untouched items that are gathering dust. Gross. For years, I've complaint to my parents about how we need to throw things out or organize everything. 

   And just to SHOW you what I mean...here's the den in working progress...
  
 
 
 
 
Here's PART of my dad's newspaper collection (I don't think this is even half!) LOOK how YELLOW they are! EWW!
 
 
So as you see, my house is VERY *messy* (talk about an underrated word)  - acutally only half of the house is like this (it's mostly the den and the ENTIRE basement). Needless to say, I'm very proud of my mommy and daddy for finally getting organizers for our junk, so that instead of having it build on the floor, it can build UP the walls! :o)MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! Hope everyone had an awesome christmas day! Mine was low key, and that's the way I like it! Woke up around 10AM (haven't been able to do that in awhile) and  jumped on mom and dad's bed to wake them up. Talked to them for an hour there, then ate breakfast, and then opened presents. Which brings me to complain about how my brother is the worse cameraman ever! He used our camcorder to record the gift opening session, and when we viewed the tape later on, we realized he only focused on everything but the head! So we can see all the action, but can't tell who is DOING the action. It's kinda funny. Silly boy. The rest of the day, just chatted with some friends on the phone and had a big turkey dinner in the evening. It's almost midnight and I am STILL FULL.  After dinner, I made short bread cookies  and mom and dad helped me a bit. Mom accidentally put 2.5 cups of butter (EWWWW) instead of 3/4 cup and so we had to wing it by putting more flour and icing sugar in the ingredients AFTER the fact that we had refridgerated it 2 hours prior. Fortunetly, everything worked out fine. :o) YAY!
 
 
RANDOM CUTE PICTURE OF THE DAY: Mocha *not my dog, unfortunetly*! (he's kind of dressed christmassy!)
 
 
 
 So I know it's been awhile since I've posted (and NEVER since Dan's posted), but we've been pretty busy with the x'mas season rush. I'm going to take this time that I have to catch up from my last entry...and bonus...I figured out how to post pix (thanks to Kelly!) Since my last post, in case you're wondering, my soccer team is NOT doing better...I think we've lost our last 2 games. Still haven't had a practice yet. 

 
 On Dec. 14th, Dan and I took a trip to Fairmont and Banff with the rest of the LADS (Lon, Adam, Dan, Sean) and Adam's girl, Genelle and Joe and his girlfriend, Patricia. Sean has a cabin in Fairmont, so we stayed there and went to Panarama to ski/snowboard the next day. D and I have only had 3 lessons (at Snow Valley) prior to our trip, so I think we did pretty damn good on the mountains - especially since we did mostly blue runs. Dan was REALLY cranky that day (*Hi grumpybear!!!*)- but I'll spare you the details. That night, we all headed to Radium Hot Springs, which was totally what we all needed! Then we went to Banff and stayed the night there, walked around Banff in the morning and snowboarded at Lake Louise for 1/2 a day. Lake Louise's conditions were much better than Panarama's b/c the snow wasn't so slushy and the weather was a bit colder. Plus, Dan wasn't so grumpy. ;o)

  Some visuals: I apoligize for the BIGNESS of these pictures - I'll have to figure out how to resize pictures (I'm thinking I need a program to do this?) 

 
 
 

 
 

 
At Sean's cabin...the LADS themselves
  

 
Ok, Lon, this is a PARTY, why are you cleaning?! Anyhow, he's going to make a great hubby one day
 

 
 
Then on Dec. 17th, I went out with some of my friends to a university house party...in celebration of completing exams. Oh...how I miss school sometimes...but NOT the exams. The host was a girl named Hania, who I went to high school with (I only know her through my friend Suzy). There, I took some random pictures:

 
Drunk Twister...looks like fun! 
 

 
Mmmmm...doesn't the food look appetizing?! Susan thinks so! 
 
 
 
Dec. 20th - We all decided to go get shit faced at Jenn's then head over to Tonic, which was VERY very fun! Cheers!
 
 
Me and Dan, aww I like this one!
 

 
Me and my girls...Jenn, Michelle and Susan
 

 
And just for shits and giggles...I'll throw this one in here. When this picture was taken, I was feeling pretty *happy* and decided to take a pic of my ass b/c I think these jeans really compliment it...don't you? :oP
 
 
 
Dec. 21- Dan's Company Christmas Party! 
 
So this is what I would look like if i was a cartoon...interesting. I took this picture on the night of Dan's company christmas party. I think I was just killing time and wanted to play with some of the settings on my camera. 
 
 

 
Lon with his x'mas present from Dan, a THREE LITRE Heineken bottle...WOW. *sorry for the inconvenience of having to tilt your head to a 90 degree angle...still need to figure this one out too!*
 

 
The house that Genelle and Adam built...
 

 
...and the comments that it brought on...
 

 
I thought this was just hilarious...this is actually at D's banquet, and for entertainment, they decided to "rap" their speeches this year. Two cute old men looking and rappin' it like homies. 
 

 
Here's Dan and all the rookies of the company singing Jingle Bells...or attempting too anyway!Many thanks to Kelly (pictured below in the tropical island-like picture *sigh*) for helping Dan and I out with our website. :o) 

 
 

 
Check out Kelly's website,  urlLink Crazy White Girl with a Keyboard 
  It's one of our fave!You know what's funny? This is my third post, and Dan hasn't even seen the site yet! HA! Ok, but I just had to post b/c my soccer team kicked ass tonight!!! WHooOp! The score was 5-1. I scored 2 of those goals, well 3 if you count the second shot I took, which bounced off a teammate's back and into the net. I won't lie...our team isn't awesome, but we definetly don't suck --although our standings do. We're either in 6th or 7th place (probably 6th after tonight) out of 10 right now...so we're slooooowly moving on up. YAY! The problem is that we don't have a place to practice right now, since elementary schools won't let us practice at their locations and other possible locations are booked up. It also costs about ninety ridiculous dollars an hour to practice at a soccer center. We may have the possibility of practicing in Ardrawson (I KNOW I spelled that wrong, but I'm too lazy to go spellcheck) - so we're keeping our fingers crossed.[Roz's posting] I got a really funny forward in my email today to Nelly's website (LADS, you will enjoy this one!), directing me to play a game called "Slap that ass" - you guys have to try this one out for yourself! Just go to  urlLink  http://nelly.hypnosismedia.co.uk    and click on PLAY GAME then select the appropriate category ("Honeyz" if you are a girl  (DUH) and gentlemen, I'm sure you're smart enough to figure out your option). Bonus: It plays the "It's Getting Hot in Here" song! Whooo-Op! Knock yourselves out!Hey, it's Roz here (without Dan) - just testing this out. After months of delaying, I will FINALLY begin our digital journal for your entertainment and enjoyment. I bought myself a digital camera about four months ago and vowed to have a site put up with tons of interesting photos to envoke feelings of laughter, sadness, disgust, confusion or whatever emotion it may bring to you folks.  I have A TON of pictures waiting to be posted!! I'm dedicating this site as my- er--OUR, new hobby by geeking ourselves out for you folks. I know, I know, some of you are thinking, "What? Geeking yourself out? Don't you do that already?" I won't answer that one, I'll leave it up to the others to decide. ;o) I would end this post with a picture, however, I haven't exactly figured that part out yet, so for now, you'll just have to be satisfied with my emoticons.   :o/       :oP     :*(       :~DAh, another disappointing day to bitch about. More stress at work...(which I don't want to get into) and tonight, played a pretty shit-ass soccer game. We played one of the worst teams tonight and LOST 2-1. I think alot of it had to do with b/c we were short-handed. Christina (one of the players in our power line) had to go into goal tonight since our regular goalie was absent. It was just even more disappointing to go from TYING with the best team to LOSING to the worst team. Like Dan said, we play like the Oilers (Remember how they LOST to Calgary and Nashville?!  Sick! ).  ONE more day until Friday night...oh, how I am counting the hours....[Roz] Ok, weird...I tried to edit the entry below b/c I see that the last picture doesn't download. Damn, it was of a cute puppy hugging a piece of grass, so that he looks like a pussywillow. AWWWW.  Anyhow, blogspot isn't giving me the option to edit the blog. Odd. Oh well. 
  
 Anyways, tobogganing was fun!!! It started to rain (freezing rain!) on my way to Dan's house and was STILL raining when I got there so we had all decided to cancel and just bum around in front of the TV and watch the Super Bowl. I don't understand much about football, but it's fun to go to live games and be part of the crowd anyways. People always doing crazy things and I LOVE the rowdiness!!! Fortunetly, the rain stopped about an hour later and the weather was absolutely fantastic for a night of tobogganing. Kelly brought her camera, so you'll have to go to her site,  urlLink  "Crazy White Girl with a Keyboard"   and check out the pictures under the Jan. 27th entry.  (Thanks Kelly!!!)  
 
 So it's about 2pm on a Tues afternoon, and I'm sitting here at home. I got the afternoon off work, which I totally needed because I JUST realized today that my job is TOTALLY stressing me out. I work with three kids, and one of them stresses me out alot b/c he can be difficult to deal with. Lately, he's been REALLY hard to deal with - grumpy mornings ALL the time and oppositional at school makes my job a challenge. I didn't think I did show signs of stress (I really try not to), but one of the teacher's and the kid's mom noticed that I talk faster and more when I am frustrated. Oops...I thought that was just me, seeing that I talk lots in general anyways. But when it was pointed out, I realized I WAS stressed out. ACK. So I am GLAD to have the afternoon off - going to go practice some karate and then watch Passions (soap), then probably take a nap. I have a meeting with my intern supervisor tonight, so it'll be good to talk to him about my stress. Damn, you'd think that working out 5 times a week would destress you enough...I guess not. *SIGH*
 
  On a good note, I am looking forward to the hockey game (U of A Bears vs. Calgary) at the university this Friday. Dan, I and friends will be going to RATT and Power Plant (bars on campus) before and after the game. If you're interested, let me know guys! Tix are only $4 if you're a student! Oh, I can't wait to go to Power plant! I miss it!!! I actually MISS school too!!!! (Not that I don't like my job).[Rozzy] Wow, this was a nice relaxing weekend (unfortunetly, not relaxing on a beach somewhere!). 
  Friday  night, Dan and I had a game of Scrabble and I beat his ass (finally I can beat him in SOMETHING). The scores were close though: 254 for me and 243 for Dan. Here's what we came up with:
 
 
 
 
 Saturday  night, went over to this girl Noelle's house (more like a mansion - they had their own gates and concrete walls surrounding the huge house) for Anahita's 24th birthday. It was a nice 'wine and dine' kind of party - there was a dinner, then afterwards, we all played a game of Pictionary - Guys vs. Girls. The girls led the whole game, but then the boys beat us in the last round. Dan and I actually went against each other in the second last round (coincidence), which was an "all play" round, where both teams must guess the word(s). ''Our word was "Swiss army knife". The girls got the "knife" part and then I tried to draw "cheese" (swiss cheese, get it?) but by then, the guys had already got the answer. GRRR! Losers had to serve the cake. 
 
 Another funny moment, was when I had to draw "Denver" but being very ignorant about America's geography, I had no idea where Denver was! So then I drew Canada with the US underneath it, so the girls knew it was in the States. Then for some odd reason, I drew a BEAVER, thinking maybe someone would get it (don't ask me how - but probably the "ver" part) and Anahita guessed it correct!!!  She thinks that beaver and Denver rhyme! What a smart girl, thinking on the same tracks as me (yes I know...odd thinking but hey -- it worked!) 
 
 
 Sunday  (today): I woke up from a really strange dream I had last night. Alot of what was in it were things that I discussed or seen last night at Noelle's house. The dream started out with D and I going to New York City for a vacation. He was telling me about how there is this rich old man (one of the richest in the world) who didn't have anything better to do with his time, so when he's in a pool, he dunks people and vomits on them. Sick.  (Side note: We were talking about people shitting in pools last night).  Anyways, when we get to New York, I'm suddenly younger  (Another side note: my dream jumps around ALOT).  and my brother is there with me. I'm about 12 years old, and we're at a "Singles Mom Dating Contest" so there were all these attractive older ladies surrounding us.  (I have NO idea why this part was in the dream).  Then the dream jumps to another scene, and we're sitting in a booth in a mall's food court with one of the "hot single moms", and she was deciding whether she should date this Greg guy, who had the most votes to go on a date with her. Merv (my brother) and I say "Go for it, he seems like a nice guy". 
  
Then the scene jumps again, and suddenly, I'm in an underground train station with a group of girls. I had to go pee, so one of the girls, Kristen  (who is an aquaintance that was at the party last night)  offered to bring me to the bathroom (which was in another building). We walked outside the busy streets of NYC and went into this back alley, where some 24 year old guy was making out with himself in his rear view mirror  (don't ask!) . We were laughing so hard that I wanted to go back for my camera, but we decided not to incase he had a gun. 
 
  Suddenly, the dream jumps to another scene and Dan and I are entering a room where there was a pool in it. I believe we were in a hotel in NYC. As we entered, I don't know why, but I went  around  the pool (which was a BIG detour) and Dan headed straight for the doors. As I was walking around the pool, I noticed a man who resembled Hue Hefner swimming, and 2 older ladies were busy flirting with him. All of a sudden, he dunked the 2 ladies and started to vomit on them IN the water!!! Dan yells, "That's the guy I told you about, Roz!!! Let's get out of here! QUICK!!!!" So the old dude turns around and vomits on a poor man swimming behind him and then he starts swimming towards me. I was panicking!!!! You know how you have such a hard time running in dreams, your feet feel like cement? It was kind of like that. And the old man attempts to vomit on me, but misses and it hits the ground in front of me! Eeeww! I was going to kick him in the head, but I was afraid he was going to pull me in and dunk him in the vomit-drenched water. I dashed to the door, after Dan, who was already on his way down a winding staircase  (which I saw at Noelle's house last night). 
There were other people running with us down the stairs...actually as I recall, we were  flying  - my hands were sweating like crazy as I held on to the rails and my feet were going as fast as they could. Someone yelled, "Becareful! I hear he likes to throw up down the staircase too!!!" And right before I knew it, he had vomited from the top of the staircase and some of it splashed into my hair.  Gross.  But that didn't stop me from running...the whole scene was a blur, all I could see where these white stairs and the outlines of people as I flew down the flight of stairs. As soon as we reached the bottom,  SPLAT  - he had managed to vomit ALL over the top of my head. I was so disgusted, I ran through this dark tunnel, where a line of women were waiting to use the bathroom. Everyone seemed to be aware of what happened, so they let me go ahead. As soon as I got into the bathroom, I saw that most of the puke had disappeared from my head, but I still wiped the remains. Then this older man comes up beside me, and I recognized him as Greg, the guy that single mom was suppose to go on a date with. He started making moves on me, and I was so revolted (as if I wasn't already!) I bolted out the door.
 
 
Next thing I know, I am in a room with Dan and telling him about how this Greg creep tried to touch me, and Dan tries to comfort me. We start to kiss passionately and...THEN I WAKE UP. What the hell, the best part of my dream is happening, and I have to wake up? Well, that's just my luck I guess! Isn't that such a f*cked up dream? I wonder what it meant?

 
  Back to reality: D and I were suppose to go snowboarding at Rabbit Hill today, but I read in the paper that it was going to be windy and there were going to be scattered showers, so we called it off. And whatdayaknow, it turned out to be a GORGEOUS day! But by the time I got out of my workout, it was already 2pm. Oh well, we're going tobogganning/tubing at Conner's Hill tonight! Whoohoo!  Anyone that reads this (in time) may come join the festivities! And I leave you with this sweet picture:d=I think it's pretty awesome when you can pay $2 for a soccer game (Roz's) and get more out of a professional hockey game (Oilers/Senators game) that costs 25 times more (well, free for me!!!).  Anyhow, at Roz's soccer game, they were playing the #1 team in their division, whom they had previously lost to 7 to 1.  After the first 5 minutes, Roz's team was down 3 to nil, and things didn't look too good.  They quickly rebounded and got a decent goal, then two penalty kicks got the game tied at the half.  To start off the 2nd half, they fell down 6 to 3 and we thought that the game was over.  They scored with about 15 then 10 minutes remaining, but had troubles controlling play for the majority of the remainder.  In the last minute, they sent out their #1 line (Teresa, Roz, and Christina - the power line) and Teresa brought the ball down to the offensive half, evaded some tackles, passed it through the crease, and Roz slammed home the tying goal with exactly 1.2 SECONDS remaining.  It totally rocked!  Amateur sport is equal or better than professional sport.  The only things that are missing are they hype and promotion.  Next weekend should be pretty fun as we'll be watching some U of A hockey, then taking a trip on memory lane, going drinkin' at the Plant, where we had MANY great and memorable nights.  laterOk, I'm going to do what everyone else is doing these days...bitch and complain about how cold it is right now!!!! Minus 31 today and I'm wondering why I should even bother getting out of bed (but then reality sinks in and guilt about not going to work starts taking over). Grrr. As some of you know, I am doing my internship working with autistic kids. One of my kids today asked if we were going to the park. "NO WAY!" was my response, and I didn't even give a second to think about that one! Earlier, he even wanted to greet his brother (who was being dropped off in front of the house by a yellow bus) by ATTEMPTING to run outside with just his sweatshirt and sweatpants on (socks too!) Lucky for my fast feet, I caught him in time. 
   Dan FINALLY got his snowboard in (after  only  THREE months!!!) so we are thinking about going to Rabbit Hill to ride this weekend. I heard that Saturday will be -15, and Sunday will be -7. I vote that we go on Sunday since it will be half as cold - I am a wuss when it comes to cold weather. My hands freeze in 2 degrees weather, for pete's sake!! 
   What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?[Roz] Wow! I am  so  tired right now! Had some great nights both on Friday and Saturday. Friday, the LADS decided to break open the 3 litre bottle of Heinekin. Dan was already significantly sloshed since late afternoon with his co-workers (trade ya jobs, Dan!) Sean had his video camera and got some of the action on footage. I'll get Dan to add that in when he can. Oh, and we had 5 foosball games against each other and  I won three  of the games! YAY! (Yes, it did help that Dan was drunk but that's besides the point!) Anyway, on to the good stuff- pictures!! 
 
 
 Friday night 
 
 
WWE: Here's D biting poor Keith in the arm! Haha, look at Keith's expression!

Check out the size of these cards - no wonder they are called  Drunk  cards!

 Saturday Night 
 
 
Friday night was Dan's drinking night, and Saturday night was mine. We went to the LADS residence to drink and then headed over to Roxy to dance. Note how pink (not quite red yet) I am. Man, I remember I thought I was talking, but I  know  I was yelling...and I didn't care! Sorry to those who had to suffer through the pain of listening to my silly ramblings. ;o)
 
 
 
 
We told Dan to smile "nicely" for the camera...here is his attempt. Nice try, Dan.
 
 
It took  four  attempts to take this picture with Lon (I couldn't centre our heads in the picture), but I finally did it!
 
 
Awww cute, Michelle and Byron (sorry about the blurriness!)
 
 
Terry, Michelle and me...wow, Michelle and I have our drunk expressions on!d=Just got back from Roz's soccer game and I can honestly say that I had more fun there than at the Oilers game this past weekend.  The soccer game ended up in a 2-2 tie, but it was full of everything...running goalies (on both teams), great plays, missed opportunities, and rowdy spectators (Quang and myself). There's definately something to be said for amateur sport over spoiled professionals.  On a side note, I never knew that Asian people can turn so red (ie. Roz's face was very tomato-like after the game)!!!Well since we're on the topic of death, I just rememebered a news story that I heard this morning. It's not so much related to death as it is to being a sick person in society. A young girl's parents and her grandmother tricked society into thinking that this poor girl was dying of lukemia so that they could collect funds from the charity they were promoting. It turns out that the whole thing was a hoax, and the girl is perfectly healthy. However, the parents and grandmother went as far as shaving the girl's head, giving her sleeping pills and putting her in counselling to prepare her for death. Now, if that's not traumatizing for a girl, I don't know what is. I wonder how this poor girl will turn out to be when she's older. Did anyone else hear about this?On a lighter note: As many of you know, I absolutely LOVE listening to the morning show on  urlLink  97.3 K-Rock  . Terry, Bill and Steve (the morning hosts) are hilarious and they always talk about interesting things (mainly, sex-related topics). Yesterday, they were talking about which cartoon character or super hero would you sleep with and tons of people called in. It was great! There were some funny answers. I just checked out the k-rock site and there's a link to cartoon porn. Click  urlLink  here   for a laugh (warning: "adult" site). It feels ironic to say that it's an adult site, although it features girls of Disney movies. I guess if I had to pick one, it would have to be either Neo from The Matrix (we all know how crazy I am about Keanu Reeves!) or Superman because then we could do it in mid-air. As for a cartoon character, I would have to say Eric from "The Little Mermaid". I HAD a crush on him WHEN (not since!) I was a little girl!  Also, maybe Tarzan...ok, I think I'm putting too much thought into this. Anyways, who would you pick and why?[Dan posting] So I was over at my sis's place yesterday for her birthday, and that got me thinking about my own mortality (?!?!?!?!?!).  When I die, I want it to be while doing something exciting (skydiving) or worthwhile (saving people from a burning building).  I think that once life gets to the stage where all you do all day is sit in a bed in a depressing old folk's home, life actually ends.  I'm not saying we die, but our life turns into mere existance.  I am totally pro-euthansia (sp?) and was just wondering what you guys thought of it.  I'm not depressed or worried about death or anything, but extremely interested.  Let us know what you guys think in the comments section.WOW! FINALLY Dan posts!!! YAY! Ok, ok...so Dan's beat me 30 times at foozball but I've still beat him 2 times. That's pretty good...right? C'mon, humor me and just agree with me, people!
  On another subject, today at karate, it was interesting. It was the first day of class for this semester and already, one of the yellow belts (second level) got his shoulder dislocated! It was a freak accident. I think he went to block a punch and BAM! It came out of the socket! I didn't see that (since I was sparring with another student). However, when I realized that he wasn't back in the dojo, I went outside of the gym to see what was going on (I can do that since I'm an instructor - ahh..the power!) He was losing feeling in his hand, so we called an ambulance. 
 I should have been back in the dojo helping the other Sensei teach, but this was MUCH more exciting. It's not like I get to see this everyday.  I REALLY wish I had my camera with me because at one point, the paramedic injected the IV needle into his arm and as he was doing that, he looked away to reach for something else. As soon as that happened, blood squirted everywhere!!! It was spewling all over his hand, the paramedic's hand and the carpet! Luckily, I was far away enough not to get sprayed. EWWW. The poor guy asked "Uh, was that suppose to happen!?" and the paramedic replied with embarassment,"Uh...no". Oops. He kept a very good sense of humor and asked for more morphine. Wow, not everyday I get to see something like this happen, especially at karate (not very many students get injured, due to strict control).WOW!!!  Here I am (finally).  Thanks to all of those who are visiting our site and leaving comments on our site (I guess we can now officially call it OUR site).  
BTW, Just to set the record straight, I'll keep a running tally of our Fooseball games.  So far, the record is about 2 wins for Roz and 30 for Dan.  Not trying to brag or anything, but just making sure the people understand the situation at hand.  
Remember to come back often...more to come soon!
+DHmmm, what's up since I've written last? Here's a brief summary:
 
  *THURSDAY: My soccer team got whooped by the Warriors (an elite soccer team, which I use to play for back when I was in gr. 6). The Warriors stand second (out of 10) and we're something like place eight. Although I'm sure we're probably ninth now. OUCH! I have to admit though, we didn't play that bad, the score was ONLY 5-1...we were expecting 10-zip...but the Warriors weren't as good as we expected them to be. Our goal was not to win, but to at least score one goal. We did just that! yay! The highlight of the night (I think), besides our one goal of course, was when I executed a "slide-and-tackle" on this one girl and she just went FACE diving into the turf!I was SO sure that I was going to get called on that one, but NOPE- the ref ordered for us to "keep playing".  That was because I didn't touch her...she tripped over me! HA! (Lon, I think you would have LOVED to see that one!) 
  
  *FRIDAY: Dan and I went with Joe and Patricia to The Attic, which was pretty dead and just playing lame music, so we headed over to Suite 69 and stayed there for a bit. There were these 3 older ladies there (around a mom's age) who were just having a hoot dancing away. (Sorry, I didn't have my camera with me!) They weren't dressed provocative...they were dressed...well...like moms. Joe asks us if we think they are considered "cougers" and I say no, because they didn't look like they were there to pounce on young horny "boys"...just a couple of moms trying to relive their youthfulness.  Anyhow, I can see myself at that age doing the same thing...any of you ladies wanna join me in 20 years? 
 
 
  * SATURDAY: Dan, George, Janelle and I went to see the hockey game, Oilers vs. Senators. Ohmygod, that was the WORST game I've seen the Oilers play (I'm sure Dan will have more to bitch about on this--if he ever writes on here!) It was such a messy, disorganized game. The Oilers looked like they were trying to fluke plays instead of setting up some. Needless to say, we were very disappointed. The score was 2-0. Did anyone else see the game? 
  After the game, the four of us headed over to The Armoury Nightclub for  Amy's birthday. I've never been to the Armoury before (it's where the old Club Malibu use to be) - and I remember I tried to get into the club last summer but they wouldn't let me because I was wearing runners. Hmm, maybe if I had the cleavage it wouldn't have mattered. Oh well. Anyhow, I was expecting it to be a posh place where everyone dresses in black and look the same. To my surprise, it wasn't that bad. The downstairs was way better than the upstairs - music-wise.  Amy had her party mostly upstairs, where they were playing retro hits. She had everyone dress up in 70's gear. Her get up was hilarious...again, sorry I didn't have my camera! She wore these HUGE pin/purple shades, a silver tube top, tight pants that hitched up her torso with gold chains in the front of it and socks OVER her pants. It was great! She had us all wear nametags, and I had mine as "R-licious" and I made Janelle get hers as "J-licious". George was "Sexy Machine" and Dan was "DHC Hardcore". I think the highlight of the night was when Janelle got hit on by this dirty (older) guy. He was saying that it was his friend's bday and that he was watching her and wanting her all night. UGH. Poor Janelle. He basically treated her like a prostitute by trying to convince her that his friend had a huge dick, etc. Poor, poor Janelle. But we thought it was funny! hehe!
 
 *When D and I got back to his place, we had a few games of foozball- AND I WON one game! YAY for Roz! Actually the game was quite intense, b/c I was SO mad since he beat me 10-0 the game before (ya I know, I suck). I was up about 2 or 3 points in this game, and then D caught up and then I would score, then he would score, then I would score and he would score...it kept going like that...until I won the final point. I guess being mad helped alot. Thanks Dan for pissing me off. :o)Not much to say today, but got something really funny for you kids to watch. It's one of those  urlLink  Priceless   advertisments.I hope everyone had the Merriest of Christmases.  I had a good Christmas.  An even better Christmas Eve.  One biff: our relatives think we're too old for presents now.  When did Christmas become just a kids' holiday?  I also think since I haven't automatically taken over baby-sitting duties, I have fallen in less favor with some aunts and uncles.  Right now I'm kinda sick of family obligations and guilt-trips.  I'm happy to play with the kids, but I was getting tired of automatically having the kids just handed to me.  I've been doing that for so long.  Some of my cousins are old enough to take over.  If it's all about obligations and guilt-trips, then it's time they start paying their dues.  Sorry for getting bitter.  I'm sick with a cold and yesterday ended on a less-than-high note.I used to love the rain.  Now I kinda see it as a nuisance.  But today I gave thanks for the rain.  I was driving back from church, around 2 pm, when I noticed that the hills by this one stretch of the freeway looked different.  I thought it was because I was seeing them in the daytime.  (This part has very little light, so I'm used to driving through it in the dark when coming back from visiting friends and seeing nothing but looming black  things .)  Anyway, I finally realized what it was.  The hills were   green.    There had been so little rain this past year that I was too used to them being brown and dead.  But everywhere I looked, there was a green covering on the hills, and the trees were greener, and the sky, though still a bit gray with storm-brewin' clouds, never looked more beautiful.  It looked like a scene from Oklahoma or some State around there.  It looked downright  Irish.   Speaking of emeralds (cuz... y'know, Emerald Isle... nickname of Ireland... yeah?  yeah?), I saw a really beautiful emeral necklace at a jewelry store at South Coast Plaza.  Sooo green.  Sooo pretty.I am such a geek that I could ramble on and on about  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  but I won't.  Tolkien is on the "respectable" side of geekdom, but I have a feeling that the number of geeks now is probably around the same number as it always has been.  (Well, since the invention of geeks around the 1950's.)  But it's just that more people are "out of the closet."  For instance, it's hard to find people who  don't  like the Star Wars Trilogy (the original), and shows like  Star Trek  have come into the main stream.  And most people nowadays are impressed with people that know a lot about computers (and want to learn themselves).  I'm guessing it's because of the nature of youth society today, based on video games and collectible trading card games and television.  Yeah, we as a nation need to be more active.  But the side-effect of our laziness is that not only is the pasty-faced, weak-muscled, bespectacled kid accepted, it is the majority.  Except in low-income neighborhoods, of course.  And that's another topic....So tired yet so much to say....During dinner tonight, my parents and I got to talking about some really interesting family history:  Somehow during the Japanese occupation, my grandfather (my dad's dad) learned english.  Not fluently, of course, but enough.  After WWII, he worked in a "gang" to catch "reds", i.e. Communists.  The way my dad describes it, they were killed, though I don't know if these gangs did the killing themselves.  If so, that's more violent than I would wish it was.  Anyway, this came about when I was asking my dad what Grandpa did for a living before he joined the army.  For about five years after WWII and before the Korean War, Soviet Communists were coming in and people, especially in the South, tried to resist and ferret them out.  So Grandpa was part of those toughs that would go around rooting up Communists and beating them up.  (What's really sad about this part is that it was Koreans vs. Koreans, which is essentially what the Korean War ended up doing.)  They were paid by the politicians of the newly setup post-occupation government.  Once the Korean War was declared (June 25th, or yook-ee-oh which means six-two-five) then the Communists in hiding started cropping up even more, and the whole gang was threatened.  So they packed up the families plus supplies (in a GMC truck) and moved south.  Later, my grandpa  walked  to join his family.  How scary is that?  So during the Korean War, the US Army needed translators and they were recruiting anybody who could do any sort of translating.  So thus began my grandpa's army career.  He was a lieutenent colonel when he left.  Then this led to a discussion about how my parents studied english in school, which I won't go into now, but it kinda brought up something.  I could make some major dough teaching english in Korea.  Even for just a short while.  Considering my jobless state, I am seriously tempted.Happy Friday the 13th!     The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring Extended Edition  rocks!!!   I really love the new parts.  They deal mostly with character and not much with plot (it would have to be, otherwise Peter Jackson couldn't really cut them out to begin with) but they do so much to expand each character, especially the hobbits.  I'm such a fan-girl.  On other news, not much else.  Applied at yet another retail store.  We'll see if I actually get a call.  Would it be considered discrimination if you don't get hired cuz you're too educated?  Nowadays so many over-qualified people apply for all types of low-wage jobs.  I've heard of PhDs applying for lab assistant jobs.  Stuff usually reserved for undergrads.  I'll eventually put a link to this blog on my website.  I think a major overhaul is necessary.  The whole Flash journal gave me ideas.Well, spent yet another night at the Art Center.  Didn't get anything done.  Watched the various videos on the official  urlLink "Lord of the Rings"  website.  Good stuff, though don't want to spoil the movie.  Don't think they will.  Such great details.  Can't wait to see Eowyn and Aragorn together.  Also checked out stuff on the  urlLink Firefly  website.  It's a great show.  I'm just sad at the low ratings.  It's going on hiatus in the spring.  I hope the show comes back.  It's so unique and well-done.  It's the anti-sci-fi show.  All character-driven, with really cool characters.  My character in the Greyhawk RPG campaign that my friend Robert was running (for only one session) was based off the character Inara, who is a whore, though in the show they're called "companions."  And not only is it a legal business, it's highly respected.  Like geishas.  And the mix of western and Asian styles gives the show such a cool look.  Not to mention all the cussing in Mandarin. :)  I remember gushing like a fangirl in front of Joss Whedon at Comicon 2001.  Well, "Firefly" would make me gush only further.  Though I would rather come off sophisticated and witty.  Ah well.Okay, this is yet another test.  It is sort of annoying that I have to log on and so forth to do it this way, but I think it's better for the most part.This is another test.Just giving this a try.  The Flash journal was neat, but a pain to update.  Well, not that painful, but I could only do it from my home computer.Ooga booga.  Must kill, kill,  KILL !!!  (Um, that's too much Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance talking.)  I'm sorta wondering how many people read this thing.  I mean, I read other people's blogs without posting on their guestbooks.  But occasionally, I do tell people when I see them in person that I enjoy their blogs.  So... well, I don't want to seem pushy, but go ahead and sign my guestbook.  I just would like to know if anyone's reading.   urlLink SAVE FARSCAPE !!!  Hey it's a good show!  Anybody out there have a remedy for eczema or really flaky skin?Didja see this past Sunday's episode of  Alias ???  OMG!!!  I felt like they just did a complete 180!  And the opening shots of Sydney in lingerie were obviously meant to keep the football fans watching.  Anyway, I managed to watch most of the Super Bowl commercials, though I did tune out for an hour while I napped and also during  The Simpsons .  They were pretty good.  I cared less about the game, though I do know plenty of Raiders fans that are disappointed.  Yesterday was my friend Andrea's 24th birthday.   Happy Birthday!!!   I can't believe I've known her since fifth grade.  Now it's come to I've known her longer than not known her.Kinda peckish, though I need to go to bed soon.  I like that  urlLink Pillar Bible Church  is early in the morning.  I mean, it sucks cuz it's so tough to wake-up in the morning (and out the door by 8:50 at the latest!) but it's also great cuz it gives me the whole day afterwards to do whatever it is I need to do.  Usually I drop by OfficeMax to see if there's anything free after rebate.  Then I spend read through the Sunday LA Times.  Worked some more on Dad's presentation.  It's now mostly adding a lot more pictures, though he wants to add a lot of corny animations and transitions.  As my video professor said, any transition other than cross-dissolve is pretty corny and outdated.  But then, that's video.  It's kinda funny that since George Lucas put those wipes and whatnots in the original Star Wars Trilogy, he now has to put them in the prequels.urlLink Hilarius  and a bit gay.  I've been working on a PowerPoint presentation for my dad.  I realized that even though I get frustrated with my dad that he can't pick up on things as quick as I'd like him to, that's no excuse for the way I've been treating him.  I just need to somehow work out a "Not now Dad" that he won't get pissed at.  Dang, my sleep pattern is off...  AGAIN !!!I saw  Star Trek: Nemesis  today.  That was... not a great movie.  The curse has been broken.  Well, it was much more enjoyable if you're a Trekkie.  Basically, I didn't get the motivations of the villain.  And the whole plot premise was... confusing.  Not that the plot was hard to understand.  It's just that they tried to do what  Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country  did, except that the story patted itself up to be more important than it was.  It was a dramatic ending, though.  I wish they had a bigger cameo for Janeway.  I wonder if they're further exploring in the novels what happened to the Voyager crew after they got home.  And I'm having trouble with my schedule at  urlLink SMC .  Gonna have to have a chat with the counselors.Ok, so far it's 4-for-4  against  Brooks College.  Let this be a lesson: when schools have to advertise on TV to get students, then it's probably not a good school.  Actually, they seem pretty good for the really traditional design stuff: fashion design, fashion merchandising, and interior design.  I'm still waiting a response from another random person whose resume I found on the web.  (On a side note, a lot of these people were surprised that I got their e-mail addresses off the web.  I guess they don't realize how thorough those crawlers on  urlLink Google  is.)  The Flash version of my website is up, but it's so sparse that it's hardly worth perusing.The Golden Globes ... eh.  No biggie this year.  Wish  Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers  won something.  Stuuuuupid flash.  Arg.  But on a side note, an all new all-flash site on the way!  Babies are cute.  Especially newborns.  Awwww.  Still don't want to take care of them.  Someone at church wanted me to take over her kindergarten Sunday school class.  Umm... I don't think I've got the patience for kindergarteners.  Heck, I barely had patience for 9-yr-olds.I finally found a place to live in Los Angeles, at least for the first month. A candid response to my posting for temporary housing on craigslist.org caught my attention and it's less that three miles to my office and it's in West Hollywood close to the action.   Let's hope he's not psycho, but my intuition tells me it will work out. His name is John Thomas (that's his first and middle name). He told me his last, but i don't remember it. It's irish.  Weitser is at work right now and tomorrow's my birthday. I've been working my ass off for glaad from home since the middle of October and look forward to having a space in their office - where i can work face to face with these guys. I leave for Freeport for Christmas with the family on Dec. 24 and head back to austin the day after christmas. Then the next day off to Los Angeles. I need to spend today and tommorrow packing my stuff for the trip and for shipping. I need to talk with aunt debbie to see how her fedex employee discount can help a gay nephew in need.  To the shower i go. Bye blogger. happy holidays.Wow. Time is ticking away. My 26th birthday is Sunday and then it's less than a week before I load my Subaru and head to LA. I still don't have a place to stay there. Hopefully it will all work out. Thus far, a Japanese filmmaker girl has offered her living room for the month (to make some cash to pay back her film bills) and this other gentleman has offered his living room as well.  Finding a place from Texas has proven to be a difficult task. There are lots of places available, but i am not in LA to hand over a big check and sign a lease like the dozens of other dwelling-seeking folks. In the meantime, I am going to go and shower and shave. If you've got a place for me to stay in LA, send me an email. :-)[12/5/2002 7:41:05 AM | Matt Lum] Welcome to my blog. I can't believe i've never utilized this amazingly free service before, but i am delighted to have found it.  I will begin here by jotting my day and agenda ... with updates on my pending move from Texas to Los Angeles.   Today I am procrastinating my drive from austin to dallas to see my good pal ernesto graduate from ITT. I do want to go, but it's so cold outside i am deterred. Brian is headed there with me, so that will be nice. I also look forward to seeing my old Dallas roommate Jason Desdamona and my old puppydog Jove. I'll be out of here within the next hour. may the force be with us. [edit]Welcome to my blog. I can't believe i've never utilized this amazingly free service before, but i am delighted to have found it.

Today I am procrastinating my drive from austin to dallas to see my good pal ernesto graduate from ITT. I do want to go, but it's so cold outside i am deterred. Brian is headed there with me, so that will be nice. I also look forward to seeing my old Dallas roommate Jason Desdamona and my old puppydog Jove. I'll be out of here within the next hour. may the force be with us.wow. life is so different these days. despite the fact it's the middle of january, today was a blistering 80 degrees. the sweet aromas from hundreds of blooming plants and dozens of palm trees stretching into the big blue sky. and the santa ana winds. the devil winds. i have time to notice these things now that i have started settling into my new pad. i am slowly falling in love with it. love takes time. and in this case, some cash. so i'll save you the details on my new pad until i get it furnished and organized. for now, suffice it to say i've got at least two windows in every room, don't share walls, floors, ceilings or a bathroom with anyone, and have a great private patio. I can pick avocados from the tree down the street and lemmons from my neighbor's. tomorrow they install the blinds on my double french doors. eventually, photos of my pad will be  urlLink    here  , so check it out.  i am delighted that this weekend is one of three days. and for such  a good reason: martin luther king, jr day. and to many more dreams, baby.  i will take the time to acoomplish some much needed business .. like figuring how to get my name off of chex systems -- as they render one helpless in today's world by making it impossible to get a bank account. i also need to go and buy some new essentials ... like socks and underwear and towels and such. and find some screws to put the legs on my table. perhaps i'll buy some paint and some material to cover my sofa. i will most certainy attempt my laundry.  enuf of chores. i am off to nap. this working 40+ hours a week is taxing. and my physiological (sp) self is still in texas.It's wartime -- and has been for almost twenty days now. I've blacked myself out from the war coverage on the networks; it's all awash with blind patriotism and driven by pollsters and politicians. All this on the heals of proposed changes in FCC regulations that would eliminate restrictions on how many outlets media giants can own. Already six or seven companies control almost ALL of the media most of us see. We should all be alarmed. As the Bush administration continues to ride the wave of terror to accomplish their goals and completely change the face of America, all the while claiming "we're living in different times" because of September 11, 2001. There's no denying Sept. 11 was a wake-up call - and demanded a re-evaluation of the way we do things - and the dangers that now threaten our  shores. An event of such magnitude demanded a response; a response of lasting international implications should be well-thought and calculated. Instead, catalyzed by the American citezens' manufactured desire for instant results, Bush and his team set into motion a response that has proven to incite religious extremism abroad (which shouldn't be surprising since so many religious fundamentalists are electing themselves to run our country), systematically strip Americans of their civil liberties in the name of homeland security, and through oftentimes obvious propaganda promote blind patriotism that equates dissent with treason and attributes the negative world view of our government to our own peace protests and demonstrations. This is a call to arms. Arm yourself with a diversified world view. Arm yourself with the power of activism and the results of your vote. Take your mind beyond a two-party whiteboy system that neglects equality and bows to Jesus at every turn. Get to know the gatekeepers.Today was the day. My energies were honed on a healthier existence -- the first steps of which will prove to be most difficult. A gym membership and the final cessation of smoking cigarettes. It's long past due and reciting the reasons for a healthier living here are a waste of time as we all know what's best for us. It's in taking the step I took today we find wisdom and relief. Cheers to a healthier future where cigarettes are out and my well-being is in.It's kinda late and i am noticing i don't use my bloggger like i should. so, here's to using my blogger like i should. Hell, i could become famous.Keep an eye on our angry earth:  urlLink IRIS Seismic MonitorThe California Recall election has excited me to the possibilities of politics. Rather than weaving my way into one of the two parties controlling our country, i may start by shaping the depate as a third-party person. I've been thinking a lot about my presidential campaign of late. I would love to run in 2020 or 2024. That will give me enough time to get my shit together. But I need to recruit volunteers now. How often in history does a presidential campaign begin 20 years before the election? It starts now.ttttttI hope all of you are a bit concerned about the state of affairs in this country. The republicans, begining with the Presidential election in Florida, have systematically taken over the government. Stacking school boards and city councils with Right Wing extremists, redistricting congressional lines to pack the House and Senate, financing a recall 'do-over' gubanatorial election in California -- all while the "Yes, Mr. President" media in this country refuses to look a the REAL issues.  We're living in troubling times. You can choose to act now or you can wait a few more years until the disparity forces your hand. We'd be better off starting today.The California Recall election never ceases to amaze me. Within the last two days, Arnold Swartzenegger has been accused (and appologized for) sexually assaulting several women -- AND -- saying he doesn't recall his comments praising Hitler. AND his poll numbers have gone up. SAVE US! VOTE NO ON THE RECALL. ---i revisit this stuff every once in a while, and today was one of those days.  wade through the mundane factual relay - it gets crazy pretty early on.  but the end is a regular novel begging me to write.  skip ahead, skip ahead.  the base comments come before shit falls horribly apart.    fuck both Manuela and Fabrizio both.  i'm still burning (gently now) over what happened over there.  and yes, i'm still warm for Anna.npcc day  it's the perfect day for our feeziks teacher ASP Chia to actually stand in front of the mike and string together more than one gramatically perfect sentence. of course, his "speech" paper must've made several trips across the english department for major overhauls... uh... i mean, touchups.   but the sight of 7 guys in npcc uniform sitting right in the rows in front of me... is irritating. like big black beetles that refuse to go away.calamity 1979  i had dinner today. outside. fish porridge. i mean eating fish porridge has a transcient feeling to me. like... caviar. or smoke--i haven't tried that though.   simon poh is going to try a maths class--chee's class in particular--at mavis. good luck, i say. "i'm going to conquer this row first." yuck.the essence of pain  three things happened after i failed my napfa 2.4km run for (approximately) the 823,513rd time: i went to play football with KS' brainy friends, then i hurt myself in the knee and pulled a hamstring (on the same leg). the fucking thing bleeds every time i bend my left knee. so now i type this mournfully in bed on my laptop.   and oh yes, the pain surges through and through; and the blood is merely a trail of its destruction. your disdain is my fuel; your pain is my cure; and for ever and ever dinosaurs shall rule the planet.personality disorders   urlLink BBC: personality 'improves with age'.  keeping in mind that lee s.h. and mr foo s.m. are the two best physics teachers on the planet (and also very retired, unfortunately), i think i see more, uh, "exceptions" in school than is the norm.   but you see, the heading of the entry is "personality disorders", and today's personality disorder goes to kenn--and seriously, there's nary a soul who can rival him in this area. today he sported an SCGS badge and snorted like a cow... all day. and what a time too--i'm reaping the first profits of a good venture (and if you allow a pun here, very foolproof!) by the end of the week. i decline details for the moment.itch  last night i caught this really big beetle (which, if you have average-length fingers and joined your index finger and thumb, would be an accurate estimate of its girth) lying on my bolster (yes, i am a believer).   i was going to use it to negotiate the doubling of my allowance, but as you know, it's mother's day today...Well today i had to cancel Humane Society because i was not able to get the car. Cable 10 is still on for tonight. I have to go for now. Have a great day!Well we did the 30 hour famine this past weekend and everyone had a great time.....I have a bunch of things to do this week...Jo is getting her teeth fixed so she will be out tomorrow......but i have everything covered....i have to do the Humane Society and Cable 10 tomorrow.....i cannot believe that in a month from now it will be my last day at the Youth Volunteer Corps. Things are going to fast....and i feel that i don't have enough time to do the things i want to do.....Well have a good day everyone!Well this is my new website for my friends only because of the crap i was getting on the other one. I will put up the comments so i can talk to you guys on this website and on MSN messager.3 MORE DAYS UNTIL I LEAVE ONTARIO AND GOT BACK TO NEW BRUNSWICK    Well things have been busy at work and i have been busy packing my stuff. It is amazing how time went by fast. I made a thank you card for the EEC Staff. The staff wants me to be at the staff meeting on Thursday. I can't believe that in three day i will be graduating.

John Moyers is Editor-in-Chief of TomPaine.com.   George W. Bush is a liar. There, I said it -- the "L" word. Someone in Washington had to.   Thanks to AWOL WMD, people all across America have the "L" word on their lips, but here in D.C. it's still a hard one to mouth. Few Washington-based commentators and fewer politicians have done so.   On Sunday, June 22, The New York Times had a chance to be the first big-league outfit to say it plainly. But the headline on Washington-based reporter David E. Rosenbaum's story, "Bush May Have Exaggerated, but Did He Lie?" was a tip that the story would pull up short. Rosenbaum considered a narrow question -- whether Mr. Bush has told any neat, tidy, obvious lies -- and concluded he has not (a couple of fibs and distortions, maybe, but no lies).   Whether the president twisted intelligence on WMD "can probably be answered conclusively only by historians when all the evidence and consequences are known," Rosenbaum wrote. (So, our kids get to pay the debt for our imperial aspirations and our tax breaks, and someday they'll be the first to know how it all happened. Great.)   Distance seems to make criticism easier. The Times' Princeton-based columnist Paul Krugman has written that the administration "systematically and brazenly distorts the facts" and is "choosing and exaggerating intelligence" and "misleading the public."   Close, but still no "L" word.   Boston-based William Rivers Pitt isn't daunted: The administration "lied us into a war," writes the high-school teacher who moonlights as a columnist for Truthout.org. "Trust a teacher on this. We can spot liars who have not done their homework a mile away."   A full-page ad in The New York Times last week by MoveOn.org and Win Without War, groups with members across the nation, put it plainly and hoisted the president on his own pointed WMD -- words of mass distortion. Under the headline "MISLEADER" the ad stacked up five of Mr. Bush's pre-war whoppers and noted, "It would be a tragedy if young men and women were sent to die for a lie." (Full disclosure: TomPaine.com liked the ad so much, we paid to run it in the June 30 issue of The Weekly Standard.)   Harley Sorensen, writing on SFGate.com, gets the prize for directness: "Why mince words? These are the facts: 1) President George W. Bush is a liar. 2) Secretary of State Colin Powell is a liar. 3) Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is a liar. 4) National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice is a liar." No mincing there.   So the word is out there in different forms -- lie, lies, lying, liar. When will Mr. Bush's putative opponents in government, the Democrats, decide it's time to tell it like it is?   Democrats have accused the president of "a pattern of deception and deceit" (Sen. Bob Graham), said he's not been "entirely truthful" (Howard Dean), and led us to war based on "unfounded assertions" (Rep. Dennis Kucinich). Strong stuff, but no "L" word.   Opposition worthy of the name would push the GOP-controlled House and Senate hearings beyond the question of what the intelligence community knew about WMD, where it seems stalled.   Sen. Jay Rockefeller, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, could invoke committee rules that would allow his minority party to launch a full investigation. But he won't -- reportedly for fear of being seen as partisan.   If this isn't the time for partisanship -- after all, we're talking about manipulations that led the nation into war -- when is? Rockefeller's timidity is allowing committee Republicans to cover what looks more every day like a lie of literally global magnitude.   Perhaps Dems fear the day when WMD are found (and they will be found, by hook or by crook). But they needn't worry -- even if misleading the nation to war weren't an issue, Mr. Bush's record is full of lies.   The president says he supports our troops -- but he proposed cutting veterans' benefits and sidestepped a law meant to protect the health of soldiers headed for combat. His "leave no child behind" pledge is a fraud -- he's vastly underfunded his own education plan, and he signed the recent tax bill even after his GOP minions sneakily removed provisions benefiting low-income families. Mr. Bush says he's a "compassionate conservative," but only a hard-hearted radical would push his Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax policies. He says he wants to expand national service programs, but he's presiding over a huge cut in AmeriCorps programs. Candidate Bush promised to be "a uniter, not a divider," but his foreign policies have profoundly divided the international community, isolated America and devalued her stock in the eyes of world.   Mr. Bush's administration is built on lies, which means the granddaddy of them all is his promise to restore "honor and integrity" to the Oval Office.   Presidential Brain Karl Rove must be worried. Rove knows that any president's popularity rests more on whether voters think he's a believable and admirable leader than on the substance of issues. George W. Bush has that going for him -- people might not like his policies (if they understand them at all), but they like his swagger and certitude, and they trust him to do what he says.   But that trust could crumble if questions linger about whether the White House deceived us into war. Few of the president's allies could or would defend that -- even GOP-TV (a.k.a. Fox News) would have trouble explaining away that one.Opening up with these excellent quotes from our dear friend, Ann Coulter:  [more in-depth attacks on Coulter later today, I promise]  This is all from her new book, Treason. By the way, I'm firmly convinced that it should be considered treason to write this kind of filth.  "Ashcroft has been incessantly attacked on the op-ed page of the New York Times by the same columnists who are now angrily demanding to know why the Bush administration didn't imprison all Arabs before Sept. 11. He has been compared to the Taliban. (And you're not a patriot in this war until a liberal has compared you to the Taliban.)"  "Like everything liberals oppose but don't have a good argument for, all reasonable national security measures are called "unconstitutional." Whenever liberals are losing on substance, they pretend to be upset about process."  "While undermining victory in the Cold War, liberals dedicated themselves to mainstreaming Communist ideals at home... Betraying the manifest national defense objectives of the country is only part of the left's treasonous scheme. They aim to destroy America from the inside with their relentless attacks on morality and the truth. (p. 289)"  Oh, yeah. Let's destroy America! Hey, people! Where are your liberal grenades? WHAT?! You lent them to HALLIBURTON?!!  "Whether they are defending the Soviet Union or bleating for Saddam Hussein, liberals are always against America. They are either traitors or idiots, and on the matter of America's self-preservation, the difference is irrelevant. Fifty years of treason hasn't slowed them down. (p. 16)"  Fifty years of Treason? If treason includes making sure that a bunch of fat pot bellied men don't take over the world, then bring treason on! *snorts* MANIFEST NATIONAL DEFENSE OBJECTIVES, indeed.  "McCarthy's fundamental thesis was absolutely correct: The Democratic Party had fallen to the allures of totalitarianism. It was as if the Republicans had been caught in bed with Hitler. (p. 71)"  Now we get to my favorite part here; this is where Ann Coulter idolizes McCarthy. This is the same bastard who ruined thousands of lives and kind of ruined the country, but he wasn't a liberal! He must be great! Bitch! How DARE she?!  "When the Democrats' bluff was called in a roll call vote in Congress, many voted for war with Iraq. Inadvertently performing a great service, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd revealed the Democrats' treasonous calculations. She explained that Democrats would be forced to fake enthusiasm for the war on terror or lose the American people forever. Democrats, she said, "fear that if they approach" Iraq the same way they did during the Gulf War in 1991, "they will be portrayed as McGovernite wimps." Consequently, liberals would lie and pretend to support America. With their votes duly recorded, they went right back to attacking the war. (p. 14-15)"  While Maureen Dowd is not the nicest person in the world, I have yet to see her condemn every conservative in the world as having committed treason. Dowd might be petty, but there is a line where she stops and rarely crosses. Coulter on the other hand, has no problem discrediting actual achievements of people based solely on the fact that she does not LIKE them, as can be seen here:  "Carter would travel to Norway to accept the award in December 2002 - two months after Congress had authorized war against Iraq. Article III's definition of treason is narrow. But after Congress's action authorizing war, for any American to accept this award on the ground offered does sound terribly like "adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort." (p. 257)"  Yes. Carter has actually helped people and done more than you ever have to help anyone else. Carter has saved lives, and Coulter has caused grief. Let's see. Who's the better person? I'm thinking here -  Oh, Clod. She is, indeed, a horrible person.Ok ... so here it goes. Icenhower was talking to me ... and she goes, shaking her head, "Sreya ... I just got the grades ... they're terrible! What are you doing with yourself! I can't believe this ... you KNOW colleges see your final transcripts ... "  But on a funnier note, Colella and Connolly were talking and Colella goes, "Ever since she got in to college she's been ... phew! Forgetting homeworks left and right!"  "Well," Connolly goes, "She must have been really smart. The way she acted in my class, she got accepted as a freshman!"I am afraid of failing Biology. I am also equally afraid of failing Calculus. Whatever I get in either of those classes should not matter because I'm going to retake them either in college, or in the case of the hated Calculus, I will be taking it over the summer.  What will happen if Rutgers rescinds my offer of admission:  1. I will be disowned. 2. I will be without a roommate. 3. Sarah will hate me for life. 4. I will be nothing, and nobody. 5. It won't matter because I am dead.  There seem to be no pros to this situation, so we'll all move on.  What I need to do:  (It's too late to accept anything but the usual F on my next bio thing. But I can complete the worksheets and make an attempt to BS stuff. The worksheets might also help me study. Count on me being up until a really hellish hour.)  I have also written the world's crappiest poem. And afterward, I think that I should eat cheese. Yes. Cheese. Moving On ...I am stuck on the plot for Sanguine Fortress. Every problem I solve creates a new one. Did you know that this hunk of junk is the largest project I have ever attempted? I won't say more than that ... I'd jinx myself.  What was today? (Two Ap exams in a row, pizza, gerbils and a very wise saying.) Samantha Figueroa asked me what I wanted to do in Spanish class yesterday, and I told her I want to make it possible for more Americans to have health insurance.  So she said to me, "I don't know what you feel about what's up there ... but you know, you'd get mad points with him." And that got me thinking more than anything else ... is there a God? I honestly don't know what to think anymore. I'm so FRIED.  Anyway ... everytime I write SF I feel better, although it's thoroughly depressing at the same time. So I'm going to keep going. And hopefully, sometime, I can read my work and say, "Well ... I've gotten a damn sight better since then."I read parts from Douglas Adams' books fairly regularly even though I have read most of his books several times over. I frequently come across stuff that I somehow did not pay adequate attention to. Today, I came across this:  Everybody has their moment of great opportunity in life. If you happen to miss the one you care about, then everything else in life becomes eerily easy.  - Douglas Adams (Mostly Harmless)  I think I missed this one because it had an SEP field around it ;-)Guess you must have heard about Chetan Bhagat's book 'Five Point Someone'. The book is the story of IIT from the insider's perspective. Chetan is IIT Delhi and IIM A passout. The book was launched in Bangalore over the weekend. Do check out  urlLink a review .   Disclaimer: I don't have any vested interest in the book and I haven't read it myself.

Don’t read any further in this post if you are a goody-good kitsch asshole. I have posted many others for people like you but this one goes out as homage to  urlLink Holden Caulfield .  If you are reading this then you probably know what a blog is and in all likelihood you'll have one of your own. You often wonder that why your blog isn't as popular as some of the other pretentious bastards on the net who have got nothing else to do but brag about their stupid mundane life or voice their opinions about things that they can do nothing about. Then why do you do it? The simplest reason for this is the fact that as humans you are craving for attention and have a belief that you are the centre of the universe. You give too much importance to yourselves. You are part of a generation that has been raised by television commercials to run after things which do not make much sense but are a status symbol in the society. The whole fuss about a 1 GB GMAIL account all over the tech savvy community proves it.  I know that you are lying if you say you never wished for a GMAIL account. In all probability you would have mailed your friends for it, contacted complete strangers requesting for it, posted petitions on various blogs, yahoo groups and orkut communities. Just look inside and try to answer to yourself,   "Why do I need a 1 GB email account? "  I doubt that the most common answer will be something other than  status symbol .  Why is it that you can’t accept the harsh realities of life? Why is it that you are always looking for other people to approve your actions? Why do you  give a fuck  to what other people say about you?  I reread this post and changed all the  WE s and  I s to  YOU s so that it makes a better impact.

If I create the profile of an average visitor to this blog it would be a 20-25 year old male, probably IITian, who never really had an actual opportunity to be in love. The question that I want to raise now is  “Is there hope?”  Frankly speaking, I don’t think so.    Love  , in my opinion, requires a certain amount of stupidity to become a real success. As the time passes by we become mature and finally reach an age when we judge everything rationally. The loss of   rational   is an extremely necessary prerequisite for love. Considering my personal case, which I presume is of majority of the readers, I was busy with studies in my high school years and I never looked so good that females would drop as I passed by. I had neither the time nor the inclination for the incidental fling in those years and never had the opportunity once I was out of high school. Spending four or five years in a college where the boy : girl ratio is 20 : 1, its human to give up on love. But, I don’t think that even after I pass out from here, I will have the chance to look for my soul mate. I know that I am not  urlLink Richard Bach  who could abandon everything and leave in search for true love. This happens only in books like  urlLink “The Bridge Across Forever”  or some Yash Chopra movie. Two years from now, most probably, I would be doing a 9 in the morning to 10 in the night job at a software firm which would not leave me any time other than weekends. Finding a girl in that time would be extremely hard as, lets face it, I would be out partying with my guy friends.   I remember Tim Robbins in  urlLink The Shawshank Redemption  when he said, “Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.” Well, Mr. Robbins mine is taking its few last breaths.I just found a site called  urlLink  GMail Swap  . Their tagline says  Because people are nice .  And there was another one that talked about a chain of free GMail invites. Their tagline was  Pay It Forward .  Now,  Pay It Forward  is one of my favourite movies. So, I've decided to be nice and give away the 3 Gmail invites I have for free. The only condition being that you do the same when you get those free invites.  Of course, I have no way of ensuring that you will actually send those invites for free, but I will trust you.  Because people are nice.  Leave a comment here with your e-mail address and name. The first 3 will get the invites. And more when I get more invites to send out.

I posted this at my blog a couple of days back, and had a decent enough response. Let's see how you guys react.  --------------------------------   I came across  urlLink this  article by Tavleen Singh via  urlLink Wonderbug's blog .  Moreover,  urlLink her last post  also got me thinking, or rather thinking again, on this topic. I left a long comment too at her post. Funny how some issues never get redundant!   Now I am not a very devout Hindu by any long shot. I never go to temples, attend  poojas  once in a while only because my parents stress on it (which they rarely ever do). In fact, I have often thought of converting to some other religion, most likely Islam, just to see if it makes the slightest bit of difference to me. But that doesn't mean that I am not aware of my history and heritage. I know more about my religion, and my caste than most people I have come across. I also take avid interest in reading up on the history and evolution of other religions. And all this has taught me one thing - many of us give a hell of a lot of importance to something as personal as one's religion and beliefs, more than what is sanely necessary. This is what politicians, most of them at least, make full use of.   I am not apologetic about being a Hindu. Just as I am not apologetic about being an Indian, Bihari, 22-year old, male, human being. I was born into it, and it is what I make of it, not what some ignorant western journalist projects it to be. That is why, it really offends me to my core when I hear the word 'Hindu' being mentioned in the media as something with orthodox, millitant, intolerant, despicable connotations. And that happens quite a lot to have missed your senses. I really don't care much about what BBC or CNN thinks of Hindus, which translates to a majority of Indians, apart from the fact that these are also inadvertently shaping the average foreigner's opinion about me. This is not very different form the picture that Hollywood portrayed of India as a land of loin-cloth clad, snake-charming, elephant-riding, mantras-chanting, black magic-practising, Kali-worshipping, idiots, for a very long time. But, what takes my goose is that even our own politicians are misusing 'secular' to mean 'anti-Hindu'.  BJP's been branded a Hindu nationalist party for eternity. There are people, and a substantial number at that, who might be dangerous to the idea of 'secularism', but there are saner people too, who just happen to be simply proud of being Hindus. It will be very naive on our part if we just get blinded by the media hype, and utterances by 'secular' parties' leaders, to believe that every single BJP worker is sharpening his knife to stab the next innocent minority community member that passes by. Come on, let's use our brains too, for once. Respect for another person is not possible in the true sense if you don't respect your own self. Similarly, you can't really respect another man's religion unless you respect your own religion too.  Actually, there are too many aspects to this and with all the thoughts erupting in my mind, I am afraid I might lose coherence. Any person with a basic sense of logic, an average memory, and some knowledge of our recent history can judge that no party today in our polity is really secular. There are some persons in every party who are, others who aren't. And so, judging an entire political party that is made up of so many brilliant individuals with their own individual traits and personalities as non-secular and fundamentalist smacks of ignorance. I could go on and on talking about the 'secular' credentials of other parties, but I am sure we are all knowledgable people here, and are already aware. The point is that public memory, as they say, is very short and very soon Gujarat riots would be forgotten. Just as Delhi re-elected Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler. Political parties, and the public, don't really care about how many people died in the riots, or who perpetrated them. Right now Gujarat is being cited by BJP baiters because it's fresh in our memory, fresh enough to extract political gains.  So to sum up there are two points that I want people to consider seriously. One, don't judge any party on the basis of whether it is secular or not, as none truly is. Two, and more importantly, don't get influenced by the media, and start believing that every thing Hindu is bad. Most of it is not. As with any religion. And that is my interpretation of Hindutva.Have you ever been to Dalhousie? I plan to go there over the coming weekend. If you have been there and can give me some fundaes (we can never give up IIT lingo, can we?).. that would be great!  What are the places around that one can see? I've checked a few things on the net, but a first-hand idea would probably be better.  Anyone in Delhi willing to take a break and visit Dalhousie?These IIT blogs are good fun. I am slowly getting pretty addicted to reading them on a regular basis. It gives me enthu to blog as well. Though, I am guessing, I am a little over the hill for blogging (seems like the average age of the blogger is below 25).  Also, seems like the Tag board/Doodle board is a permanent fixture on most blogs. Am wondering if anyone knows the approx % of current students in IIT who blog? Are they from a specific insti, dept, hostel etc. Or is the phenomena widespread?   Also all you bloggers beware. NY Times is calling it a  urlLink serious addiction  :)  On another note, We have a feature which provides a script that allows bloggers to recommend favorites.  You can check it out here:   urlLink AiYo favorites   Sorry for the shameless self-promotional plug... But thought that it was relevant to blogging and may even be fun for ppl.And welcome  urlLink Haloscan  comments!Enetation (the comments provider) is sucking granny's balls again, so there's nothing to it, I just have to write a full-scale epic update instead of a quick break from work with a quickie in the comments.   Actually, it may be the internet's fault this time, nothing seems to be working properly today. I was trying to check my bank account earlier (since the shopping spree on Saturday... uh... £80 to a comic book store. Among other things), since I have to do some more shopping before my lovely little business trip on 16th. I'm sure I brushed on the subject before; shopping for clothes is a bloody nightmare. Having to go in and out of countless of shirts which all look equally horrible on me, if they fit on at all. Depressing, sweaty business.   Anyway , that's beside the point. I'll have to dress up all nicey, and -  gasp  -  talk  to people!   On the other hand, I  will  get my flights reimbursed by the company, plus I'm taking the Friday off and spend the whole weekend in Finland. I haven't decided if it'll be friends or family weekend, though.  As for cigarettes, I didn't have any. My colleague Valkyria had. :P    LinktoComments('commenting')    urlLink CommentYet again I was short on points yesterday. I can't believe how many points I'm allowed and as I've never been a big eater (  just eaten the wrong stuff  ) it seems to me that I'm eating huge amounts of food.  You're allowed to save up to four points a day. But you can't take last weeks points to the following one. Opposite to Laura I can easily eat points during the weekend. That's my time to live a little. But during the week... that's a different matter. Why? Probably 'cos I'm running around like a headless chicken 'cos the kids, whereas on the weekends I've got my hubby running around with me. Besides I like eating nice stuff on weekends, sort of keeps me going on this diet.   I suppose I should start having a bowl of cereal or some toast before going to bed to make up for the missing points. Previously when I did the same diet I made up the points with bags of crisps and chocolate, which sounds tempting, but hey if it would've been the right thing to do would I be writing here today..no, I'd be one of those skinny bitches Laura keeps going on about. But at least you can eat the nice stuff on this diet, provided you're prepared to make sacrifices other times.   As for that cigarette in the train, Laura!!! Tut, tut. How come you has some on you? And the bag of popcorn, not too bad. I sounds to me you do need something... lots of it. It's got three letters and start with s and ends in x!   LinktoComments('toomanypoints')    urlLink CommentI'm just about to cave in and go buy a Coke. Yesterday I had a cigarette in the train on my way home,  and  I ate a whole bag of pop corn in the evening... If I didn't know better, I'd say I'm pregnant! I just want... Something. Lots of it.  Arrrrrrrrrrgh.

Dieting  and  blogging is much more fun with someone else, and like the girls at  urlLink Ass be gone  said, keeping diet on a web log does actually help keeping you motivated. :-)   Points for 28.9.:  24/24   LinktoComments('welcomeKatie')    urlLink CommentLast week was my first week with counting points. I tried just  eating less for 3 weeks, but on the third week I lost nothing and I couldn't understand it, so started points a week ago. So today, after a hectic schoolrun (well, got up late, Livi coughing like she had croup, which had to be checked by a doc, feeding the kids, sorting livi's hair out, getting dressed and dressing kids, ect.)I finally got to the scales which are tucked well underneath the dresser in our bedroom. To my surprise I've lost 3 pounds!!! Yippee!  I went out with the girls on Saturday night and even after the (uncountable) slices of pepperoni pizza and yummy garlic bread I managed to lose weight. Brill.  Still, I've got more to lose than Laura, so I've got a long way to go. But this is how it'll start, pound by pound.   LinktoComments('points...bloodypoints')    urlLink CommentWeekends are so hard for eating full points. Even now I'm just craving a cigarette, and I quit smoking months ago, not having really craved for them since. Yesterday I craved for a pot of vanilla ice cream. I've eaten breakfast, and a bag of sweets today; there's some chicken ready on the pan, but I don't feel like eating.

I've lost as much this week as in the past three. Yay! That can be put down to stress and working from home.  And  I crossed the fated 200 lbs mark, too!  I was wearing a pair of trousers yesterday - as you do - and I noticed they're hanging ever so slightly loose around my thighs and I thought  "Surely not the diet...?"  I mean, what kind of a dietist loses off the thighs or ass, and not fro the belly?  Oh well, I'm bound to lose this particular high in a couple of hours - I'm being sent on a business trip (my first ever) to Finland in a couple of weeks, and I must buy suitable clothes. Urgh. Garment-shopping is always as depressing, especially if I'm having to look for things that are, well,  presentable.   I exceeded my points yesterday, but I did it on purpose because I wanted to use up some of the points I didn't eat earlier this week.

It's all boring, boring, boring. More specifically, it's all rice cakes, bread, different forms of chicken, pasta and cucumber, which makes my mouth itch something silly. I'm bored. And suddenly I'm not enjoying our quite-frequent cooking or restaurant-eating nights, because I'm hawkeyeing the points, and invariably feeling guilty afterwards. And right now, I've half a point to spare for tonight and I really, really fancy that bag of Turkish Pepper I hid on the bookshelf.  Weighting day tomorrow.   Points for 24.9.:  22.5/24   LinktoComments('whatsthepoint')    urlLink CommentTwelve hours straight at the computer and counting - and that was just my working hours today. It's not even a very comfortable chair. I was not inspired to eat much today, until at dinner time, by when I was ravenous! I indulged in basmati rice (yum yum) and chicken breast, which I'd left in marinade at around noon today. Very nice.  *belch*   Points for 23.9.:  20/24   LinktoComments('ass')    urlLink CommentI've had no time for eating nor proper blogging for a couple of days, today being no exception...

Oh, they had bread, but only the kind with seeds in that makes me gag. I bought two slices anyway and they're currently staring at me in an offensively offhand manner from the floppy paper plate; "Can't handle seeds, eh? Loser."   I am not  bird.  Bravely, I tried eating some (dryand uninteresting) salad which I was allergic to, but I soon found out I'm not a bunny either. In the end, I ate a bg of sweets and a bottle of Coke and pretended it was what I really wanted to do all along. Today is just really not my day, but happily, I've made my excuses and will shortly go and work from home.   Points for 21.2.:   24.5/24   LinktoComments('picky')    urlLink CommentI've have gorged on those famous oven potatoes and chicken breast and Hollandaise-sauce. I had one portion, which would have been quite enough, but then I still had half of everything left on the cooker, and well, you know... It's not going to be any good tomorrow. So I loosened the belt and ate the rest of it. Oh-my-god. Good thing I ate little anything else today.

The razors caused too much pain, But life was much much worse. The strength to push down harder, Just wasn't really there. She wasn't very sure, But honestly didn't care. She thought no-one would miss her, Notice they would not. But little to her knowledge, She would never be forgot. People were all amazed, All her family could do is cry. Everyone felt bad, Her friends just wondered why. Teachers were confused, Her bullies all felt bad.

And Id like you to know that I would never do you wrong I would never lie or do you harm…  But I don’t know… I don’t know if you’re the girl for me?

Courtney is never going to get the bigger guitar. she;s going to be stuck with baby forever. or at least until she buys eric. i have a new part time job! its tutoring my brother! i get $10 a day! ohh yes ohh yes. i know you're all jealous because i get $10 for an hour to an hour and a half max. well i guess thats life. or something like it. bahhh dum chhh. today sucked and i'm such a little weirdo. and an obvious one at that- when it comes to liking guys.

So instead liz and i are probably going to do something, which i would like to believe will be more fun than the dance.  guy sucktoday was play practice. nice job working out court. i didn't. but i just made cookies. i might go to soccer tonight but i doubt it because tomorrow is the chem final and thats the determiner to whether or not i stay in the class. so i have to study. well i dont have to but i probably should. its cool that jeanine finally signed up for this. tonight. is. lame. no way am i going to soccertoday i worked out with tray so at least it was somewhat productive. i didnt study for my finals today. good thing because what a waste of time that would of been. they were easy for me but whenever thats the case i usually do bad. wellhahahhah jeanine well grant is a fag anywayWell the only reason I signed up to be in this group blog is because... I was kind of skimming through it and I saw what Court said... It was something like I hate my brotehr I'll see you in hell John... and well that just cracks me up uncontrollably... hah Court member when we made the list of things we hate in school and for Mrs. Grant it said I'll see you in hell women.,... good times... Oh wait member when we made the Pros and Cons list lol ... shhhhhh don't tell the boys we did it on haha ... well that's all for now... actually one more thing... Dave Matthews Band concert tickets go on sale soon but I'm not sure when so if anyone knows could they let me know!  I have 13 dollars saved i think I'll make it to 58 by the end of feb lol oh well... Dave kicks ass... CyaNo problem keiko, even though i didnt drop anything off because i SUCK. today english was fun because me and emily made fun of people and bobby laughed,. and then he drove us home from school yay! lol bobby rocks.today was a shitty day and ive added another medication to the list. its to help with my anxiety. yeah... great...So since I'm at home, while all of you are at school (muahahaha), I'll tell you about the different symptoms I've been experiences for the past three days......migraines, dizziness, sore throat, fever, stuffy nose, cough, nausea, constant tearing (don't know what that one's all about), chills followed by extreme sweating, and my favorite--looking at people and thinking that they're moving really fast and being really loud...it's kinda hard to explain.  So anyway my mom's threatening to take me to see my doctor, who I'm soon changing, who is this crazy indian lady (no offense) that looks like a man and is very rough and has cold hands.  it's not a fun experience.  So this weekend I watched Dune, Flower Drum Song, the Signs, and a bunch of home movies. Dune is the weirdest movie i've ever seen, there are little girls with glowing blue eyes, fat guys that have plugs in their stomach who float, huge worm things that people ride, etc.  Audrey thanks for calling me and dropping stuff off for me, you're an awesome friend.Today i went on a roadtrip with my parents it was kinda fun just because there so lame. we went to gurnee mills and i almost bought a purse but i didnt. (not really i just kind of looked at it) and american eagle is so boring i have a 15$ GC there and i dont really like anything there. then we went to lake geneva and some other really boring wisconsin towns. my dad went into alot of antique shops. you know. the usual. but i did get a double dare shirt from this junk store so i guess it kinda made the day.FOR MY BIRTHDAY I HOPE TO GET: a flatscreen monitor, a flatbed scanner, and a new printer. yes yes yes. all things tangible and doable as my father would say. court is on a road trip today i tried to take notes for chem and failed. i couldnt even start them how do you start?! what do you do?! what is chemisty?! why is is so hard for me? helpi think i'll read a book or something. a nice one with a happy ending.well ya lied on that court because its 1 now and you still haven't gone to bed... neither have i... but so what?it is 12:35 am and im kind of tired but i really dont want to go to bed. i hate that feeling. i wish i could see who reads these pointless posts.  i think maybe ill try sleeping since there is nothing better to do.i hate school more than anyone will ever knowLast night i had the weirdest longest dream of my life. weird. and then before that i was sleep walking and talking to courtney and i yelled at her and then watched some weird meet the parents interview thing while i was sleeping and i dont remember any of it. but i remember my dream and man it was so long. like years long i just explained the whole thing to court and it took like 10 minutes it was crazy long. and weird most of all! what should we do today?i hate that woman at walgreens who broke the picture machine so i can't see my pictures until tomorrow god damn her. tomorrow i think i am going to a coheed and cambria concert with jeanae and julie and ashley even though i dont really know ashley i think it will be fun. well i hope it will. it should be. i have no recollection of what happened last night and i dont remember sarah or courtney leaving i dont really remember much. but tomorrow i am skipping soccer hahahahahaahha. and im not doing my homework either! ahahahahahahahahahahah im a rebel with a cause. i got my report card today. 3.3 unweighted oh audrey you are so  smart .. haaaaaaaaahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa anyway. charlie rocks and turnabout will be pretty trendy especially if court ever buys a nice trendy dress like i did. the group right now is me carter courtney charlie keiko and mike. we have just too many friends to include them all so i made a list of the top 6 that i wanted to be in my group. sorry to all my many friends who had to be excluded from this. i will make it up to all 700 of you later. i promise.So tonight me aud and sarah were watching office space. but i fell asleep in the middle and when i woke up again around 11:25, sarah was gone and audrey was sleeping. i was like ehhhhh what do i do now? but i called my parents and got outta there without making a peep or waking audrey up. damn im goodPAUNANG SALITA HELLO!!! Halina at makisama sa mga adbentyurs ni Hermes at Jackie. Ang aking 2 alaga...punong-puno ng buhay at aksyon...na minsan ay may halong S.T. flick. ETO...   DA ADBENTYURS OF HERMES AND JACKIE  ADBENTYUR #1 Uunahin ko yung mas matanda...si JACKIE Ipinanganak sha noong March 14, 1997. Nung dumating sha sa bahay namin...napaka-amo at mahiyain nya. Palaging nakabuntot sa akin...di ko sha mashado napaglalakad sa bahay nuong una dahil...meron na rin kaming isa pang dalmatian sa bahay...si SLY! Si Sly ay hindi purong dalmatian...80% lang sha...isa sa mga characteristics ng dalamatian ay ang pagiging territorial nito. Kaya nung dumating si Jackie sa bahay...nagkaroon agad ng mortal na kaaway. Habang lumalaki si Jackie...unti-unti naman itong nagkakasungay (hehehe). Siya ang nagle-lead sa iba pa naming aso (may 2 pa nun...si Sly(dalmatian) at Hubbs(terrier))para magkalat at mag-ingay sa bahay. May isang pagkakataon na binagsak ni Jackie yung salamin ng dining table namin.BASAG ANG SALAMIN!!! Hirap na hirap akong tanggalin sha dun...mabuti na lang at konting galos lang ang nakuha nya. Siguro kung kaya nya lang ibagsak ang piano matagal na nyang ginawa. Sa bahay...si Jackie at Sly ang umuubos ng betadine kesa sa aming pamilya. Lagi silang masaya sa garden...binabasag ang mga paso, nagbubungkal ng lupa...atbp. Maraming kuwento ng kakulitan itong si Jackie...tsaka ko na ibabahagi sa inyo! :D  Si Jackie ay isa sa mga pinaka-mabait naming aso...mabait na makulit. At eto ang isa pang natatangi nyang kakayahan...galit sha sa panget...no offense ha...pero minsan kumatok sa aming pintuan ayung isa naming kapitbahay na madaming inaaway...biglang tumahol si Jackie nang pagkalakas-lakas...at mistulang lalapain na iyong ale. Iyong aling iyon na maraming kaaway...at talagang masama ang ugali lang ang kinahulan ni Jackie ng ganung katindi.  Si Jackie rin ang aso naming marunong umarte...heto ang kanyang picture     sinasadya nyang pagandahin ang tenga nya ng mga panahong kinuhaan ko sha...kasi tangan ko sa kaliwa kong kamay ay isang biscuit. Itong aso kong ito...lahat kinakain...kahit papel kakainin nya...ganon kalaki ang tiwala nya sa akin.  itutuloy...    NOTE: THIS WAS ELOISE'S ORIGINAL POSTI just want to remember this day.Earlier my aunt living in Nevada gave me a call. I barely recognized her voice because of her hard sobbing, and I instantly knew what was wrong.You see yesterday evening when she called me up, she's told me that right at that moment, her baby - Raider, a 7 year old black labrador - will go under the knife and that she and her husband were frantic, worried sick. She's told me that there were bumps over Raider's body. I knew it didn't looked good and my aunt who is a nurse, seemed to refuse to face the possibility that her baby could die...but 'mothers' are like that, aren't they? But when the vet cut Raider open, instantly they knew that the cancer has spread all over his body and there's just no hope. So immediately they told my aunt and uncle and asked them if they would want them to close him up, wake him up so that they can say goodbye. They were also told that Raider was really suffering. They chose to let him rest in peace. He was cremated and today his remain will be delivered to my aunt.  I just want to remember this day when I wasn't able to console my aunt.....The day when I realized, that someday, I will experience the same thing when my babies decide to 'go away', for good.Raider, rest in peace....someday mom and dad will be just fine.heRe's goLLum with the kittens. see the one at her back? i aLways thought that one Looks Like SAM, that girL who won the starstruck kids finaLs. hehe. I was actuaLLy surprided when i saw them this way, in peacefuL coexistence. Kasi, goLLum aLmost aLways pLays with the 3 cats... Karinyo BrutaL ang Laro niLa.       then, here's goLLum now... sus, kaLandi... hehe. Titingin pa e...              posted by: BEBELABSadbentyur #2   Meet Hermes (her-mee), born:june 7,2001 breed:shih tzu color: tri-color gender: female    Bigay lang sa akin si Hermes ng isa sa mga students ko. Medyo di na sha naa-alagaan dahil sobrang busy na nung bata (kyna)...nagkasakit na si Hermes. She had Heartworm and was confined at The Animal House vet for 3 weeks. Nung umuwi na sha...nakapag-decide na ang parents ni Kyna to give up Hermes. At shempre....sa aken nila ito ibinigay (fave teacher nya akowe!)Habang inia-abot sa akin si hermes ito ang last words ni Kyna at Aissa (magkapatid) Teacher Eloise...she'll be your dakilang alalay". Nung inuwi ko si Hermes sa bahay namin...ang payat-payat nya at kalbo...hindi sha mukhang aso...mukha shang pusa. Still...hit na hit si Hermes sa bahay at di lang dun pati na ren sa aking mga kaibigan. Totoo yung sinabi nilang "dakilang alalay" si Hermes kasi kahet saan ako pumunta...sunod den sha ng sunod. Inakyat ko sha sa taas sa kwarto namen para laruin. Dun muna sha para di mashado magselos si Jackie...bumaba akong sandali para ihanda yung kanyang pagkain...ng biglang...blag...blag...blag..."Si Hermes nahulog sa Hagdan!" sigaw ni Nanay. Ay sus..sa sobrang pagiging "pala-sunod" nagpatihulog sa hagdan si Hermes to be with me.  Awww...ain't she the sweetest?    posted by: ELOISEurlLink    This is HER! :D  This is Baybee Booskie when she was a pup. Thats her topak mode. Oh, by the way, this is the other boo. Not the one that died. This one's the doggie that lives with me.I just noticed that no one else was posting here the last few days...except me! lolz. I just read mama sangre's post earlier on about rescuing that poor lil creature.   I took the liberty in logging onto my local animal shelter's website and goshiez, the pets up for adoption are soooooooooo cute!! If I could only have them all, I'd definitely go for em. The dogs that look like mops, the ones that look like brooms...the ones that look like old men...hehehe. Well, theyre all cute.I have a friend Who longs for a companion (Like her husband isnt enough)  One with big droopy eyes (full of mucus)  One with big fat cheeks (that hang like water balloons)  One with a wrinkled face (that looks like a wrinkled butt)  One with a cold nose (cuz its always full of snot)  One with a big mouth and bad breath (that drools like a water fountain)  One that she can cuddle (i dunno why she couldnt settle for a pillow)  One that she can feed (Ahem, HUSBAND?!?)  One that she can take care of (mm, how about a plant?)  One that she longs for so much (that she actually asked me to write something about,  what a waste of my time!)  One thats actually a DOG named TJ!  LOLZ!! okay the dogs actually cute. I was just bein sarcastic..DUHi first met him  a little more than three years ago, when i was volunteering at the local dog shelter. we found him abandoned at his original owner's home. the owner left him, though she really didn't want to -- she had to go to heaven. so there he was: barely three months old, very frightened, and very alone. he didn't know we were there to help him, and so he was a difficult little ball of fur to handle.   i came into the room and our eyes met, neither of us realizing that at that moment, both our lives were going to change forever . as the days passed, he eventually warmed up to me -- he possessed all of the usual shar pei attributes, including being aloof and even suspicious of strangers. i named him noah, because of his burly disposition and the wrinkles on his face, he reminded me of an old man. he won my heart completely and i decided to be the one to give him his new permanent home. he decided to give my life some meaning.  i live alone, noah gives me reason to look forward to coming home every day. he is an intelligent dog, and typical to most shar peis,  he acts with great dignity  and is completely loyal to me. he trusts me implicitly. he makes me feel needed, like i'm a fine person and that i'm safe. definitely, safe, for he is very territorial and though he has never bitten anyone, he lets guests know he doesn't like their presence in his turf. shar peis are definitely not for the first-time dog owners, but i've had lots of experience with dogs in the shelter. i was very lucky that i had the chance to get to know such a magnificent creature. without noah, i'd have been lost long ago.  sadly, noah's plight is not at all uncommon.  there are millions of dogs in shelters , waiting for someone to take them home and give them all the love and affection that they're more than willing to return. in england alone, every citizen must have 14 dogs each to give all the dogs there a home. if you're thinking of having a dog, please visit the shelter in your area. or at the very least, research about the breed you are thinking of buying, so that you will know what to expect. having a dog is an enormous, long term responsibility, one that we should all think of very thouroughly before acting on. the rewards, however, would be beyond your wildest dreams.I have always loved animals; especially DOGS. Growing up, I had all sorts of pets; from Birds, Rabbits, Fishes to Dogs. Each were special in their own way. What I appreciated most from these animals is their ability to sense our feelings. They know when you're down, when you're happy...they know YOU.  Five years ago, when my brother went back to the Philippines to continue his education; we got a Dog...just to keep him company. A Dog named Boo. She was a sweet little thing, a sweet and beautiful Mongrel. As time went by, we all got attached to the Dog. Although the rest of my family and I were living overseas, each and everytime we'd go back, she was always there. She was a part of our family. As she grew, her primitive instincts developed and she became one of the most feared dogs in our neighbourhood. She protected our home. She protected us.  Apart from being the protector that she was; she was also a very good mother to her puppies. It was such a sweet sight whenever we'd give her little goodies then she'd call her babies one by one; feeding the youngest first. She had always put her kids first. Just like we humans do. She also offered us lil gifts at times. She once caught a fish and brought it to my dad. She also caught a bird and did the same thing. Everybody loved her.  Two Years Ago, we received a Phone Call from my Cousin. He lived with my brother and he too looked after Boo. He told us that the 15 year old son of our neighbour had shot our Boo in the heart - IN OUR FRONTYARD.  She was 3 months pregnant...and she was shot right in the heart...right in the heart. She laid there, in our resthouse and bled to death. My Cousin phoned by brother shortly after and he rushed home.  My whole family was outraged. Everyone cried. We loved that dog so much. People say that we are foolish to have such a strong attachment to just an ANIMAL. She wasn't just an ANIMAL to us; she was our FAMILY. Til this day, I still find it hard to talk about the incident. Writing this has made tears well up in my eyes. It still hurts. I still miss my Dog. Sometimes its hard to understand the things people do. Animals are still living beings...they breathe, they feel, they love just as we do.  My family has tried to take the case to court. However, since it is the Philippines, nothing much has been accomplished because according to them, it was just an ANIMAL. Since the incident occured, I havent returned to the Philippines. I do not know if I could control myself under the circumstances of seeing that family and remembering what they did to my Dog. It still hurts and I still miss her.A new added attraction on our mini zoo... :D she's a 3 monts old monkey and we call her Chi-chi.  At first medyo takot pa sya sa tao. Medyo aloof.. and mabaho. hehehe!! Ano nga ba naman ang maaasahan mo sa pet shop to take care of this little soul.. siguro matagal na siyang walang ligo. Medyo manipis ang hair nya and payat talaga. Kawawa namang nilalang. Nabulunan pa nga nung first time naming pinakain ng saging... and we thought fruits lang ang puede nyang kainin.  As week pass, medyo nakakarelate na din siya sa environment nya. Nililiguan namin siya thrice a week and she slept with my sister. Of course, medyo takot kami kasi baka may sakit, may ebola, may aids, lahat-lahat na but then unresistable talaga ang charm ng little chi-chi na to sa amin.  Oh my.. kumakain din pala ng kanin ang unggoy. Minsan kasabay namin siyang kumain.. OO nga.. nang-aagaw sila ng pagkain minsan. hehehe! may pagkamaldita lang tong bata na to kasi pag nandyan na nanay nya (my sister).. ayaw ng sumama sa kin. Whenever her mom's at school, she's here with me at my shop... and she always fall asleep in my arms na parang baby talaga. As we know, maingay dito sa shop.. pag inaantok na ang bata at may biglang malakas na tunog.. sumisigaw siya... minsan bumubulong.. siguro sa loob-loob nya  "ano ba naman tong lugar na to.. ang dilim dilim pero ang ingay"  or kaya  "ano ba kayo! inaantok ako! wag kayong maingay!"  hahaha!!    Ah.. may isang beses lang pala siyang sumama sa kin na nasa tabi lang nya yung sister ko.. wala pang isang minute.. inihian ako. Bad Chi-chi! Even Bullit have an experience on her peeing habit... Ganon siguro sila, parang sinasabi na.. "this is my property" chuvabelles. :)  Her latest improvement.. Playful. At first, takot siya sa 3 aso namin... even with my little Schat. Minsan kasi tinatahulan or kinakagat siya (kagat na lambing) nung mga babies ko but not now.. palaban na din ang matsing. Not really palaban pero kaya na nyang makipagsabayan. One morning, nasa lapag lang siya at di nilalapitan ng mga aso.. Di siya pinapansin. Nilapitan si Achilles (which is so big na..) at kinurot near his pwet. Syempre, ang initial reaction ng aso.. kinahulan tapos kinakagat-kagat siya.. She also do that.. nakikagat din ang loka.. Nakita ni Schat na nilalaro ni Achilles si Chi-chi.. lumapit ang dalaga ko (si schat).. ang nakiharot na din. Contented ang 2 (Schat and achilles) kasi nakaganti and they left her. Ay naku.. she didn't even cry kahit pinagtulungan nung dalawa. Pero Chi-chi is not contented, nilapitan ang Schat at siya naman ang kinurot. Tawa na lang kami ng tawa sa kalokohan nya. hehehe! Don lang sa isang aso (na adult na talaga) siya di makaporma kasi baka iwasiwas siya non. Hahaha!  Ok na yung itsura nya ngayon... Makapal na yung balahibo nya, may buhok na unlike before na nakakalbo siya.. and syempre.. tumaba na din. :)  Sabi ko sa sister ko, ituring nya yan parang tao.. dapat laging yakapin, alagaan (as what Ate Thess told me) pero parang sobra ata tong kapatid ko kasi kahit pagtulog at pagkain.. magkasama na sila. Hehehe!    I really wanted to post a picture of my sister and chi... pero di maupload dito eh.. can somebody help me.         posted by: JOANNEI thought of posting this photo of Danielle when one day I saw her, just her head, peeking outside when she heard the noises I was making in the kitchen. Curious as she's always been and with half eyes closed, there she was trying to find out what mama's been up to.        taken yesterday ( july 31st )...this was Gizmo sleeping on top of his shirt. It's a known fact that ferrets sleep in the dark but since we've been having warm weather the past days, the light didn't seemed to bother him ( Jacob and Danielle were sleeping under their other shirt )        Also taken yesterday, their dad and I decided to buy them a piano hoping to find out if we have a  Mozart  in the family ( that's not all together true, we got jealous because the other day, we saw a piano-playing-ferret on tv so we thought.. perhaps our kids can do better. )  Jacob  played about  3 notes  out of curiosity. Papa and mama actually clapped their hands when they heard what  Jacob  has accomplished!          Unfortunately the piano didn't interest them at all, all they wanted to do was to destroy it.  KIDS do the darnest thing!!Lord thank You and take away all fears that I have right now.  Give me and fill me up with Your love.  Right now I am scared and need your help desperately.  Please work everything out for Your good.  Help me love You and act on that love by loving other people and worshipping You.Father,  Make the deepest desire of my heart be for me to live to glorify You and have You glorified in me.  There is nothing else that can fit Your will completely in me.  Help and give me a mindset with this in mind.  I want to die to my flesh, so that I may be able to walk in Your Spirit and likeness.  I want to reject any part of myself and gain all of Your qualities.  I need You to save me from myself, or before I know it, I will kill myself, but not to You but to the world.  Save me from everything, give me Your strength.    Love, HannahLately I have been so confused of what I have been feeling.  I know that what I am doing is right, that I have God's blessing, that I am in His will.  Yet, at times I feel like I am having pride and lack of love and compassion.  I wonder, will I have the words to express all these things?  Will I make sense?  Why did I take this burden on myself?  Why didn't I allow God to help me?  Why didn't I go to Him and let Him open my eyes sooner?  Why was everyone so scared to tell me?  Why didn't I listen when they actually did?  Man, I can be a dumb man.  Yet, thank you Lord that You are bigger than me and all of this.  Thank YOU Jesus, that You are helping me through this.  Guide me Lord and show me when and how to communicate and love her through this.All my life I have been trying to please my dad.  God has continually told me, "Please Me and you will be pleasing your dad."  So then I continue to try to press on to be obedient to the Lord and follow Jesus daily.  As I grow and notice the truths in His word and the wickedness of the world around me, I get more and more convictions that I need to follow in my life and obey.  Yet, then I become a person that my dad doesn't want me to be.  He wants me to do nothing but get a degree and get married.  He doesn't want to wait for the right timing.  He doesn't want me to serve God.   He misunderstands so many points in the scriptures and then gets angry with me because I try to follow them out.  He is the only person that doesn't want me to go to Africa because I need to go to school.  He is upset with the way I am turning out.  Yet, since his expectations of Sarah are lower, I would say that he is equally pleased with both of us.  I'm not saying I am perfect or he should even be proud of me.  He has asked, "Can't there be something in the middle?"  Why does he want idle daughters that want only what the world around us tells us to?  Why doesn't he want me to serve the Lord by working with children in Africa?  The Lord has been so faithful to me and yet he doesn't even notice.  Yet, I can't have the hope of pleasing my dad, I just need to be obedient to God.   Many times my relationship with my father is the hardest struggle in my life.  I want to obey him and respect him as I am told to do in Galatians and Colossians and throughout the Bible, yet he doesn't even respect the fact that I am attempting to follow Jesus daily and to go where He is leading me.  My dad may never be supportive or see the views that I hold, but I know that they are of the Lord and Jesus is there helping me and guiding me.  Once again, Jesus tells me, "I love you, you are in My will.  Don't wonder what he wants, only do what I want.  Never feel bad for doing what I desire."Wahoo!  So much is going on.  I am praying about going to Africa and an application to Rainbows of Hope is being mailed to me today.  I am pretty sure this is the organization that I want to go with.  I hope Jessica likes it too.  It really seems like God wants me to go.  I pretty much just need to trust in Him to provide and show me the way.  God is good, all the time.  All the time, God is good.In the pamphlet, "My Heart - Christ's Home", Robert Boyd Munger is talking about how he was spending time in the morning's with Jesus in the living room.  He had been missing the daily time and hurrying in the mornings.  One morning he saw Jesus in there waiting and he asked Jesus if He had been there all along.  Then Jesus explaned:  "The trouble is that you have been thinking of the quiet time, of Bible study and prayer, as a means for your own spiritual growth.  This is true, but you have forgotten that this time means something to me also.  Remember, I love you.  At a great cost I have redeemed you.  I value your fellowship.  Just to have you look up into my face warms my heart.  Don't neglect this hour if only for my sake.  Whether or not you want to be with me, remember I want to be with you.  I really love you!"   I know this is how the Lord feels and that I really need to spend more time with Him.  Yet, He has been on the back burner.  I need to move Him up to the front and make Him my top priority.  I have in some ways, like with my convictions.  Yet I haven't with my time.  I continually put people as more important in my schedule.  I know that there are technically 2 front burners on the stove, but God needs to be on both.  Lord help me make you more important in my life.  Help me stand up for You and the things You desire for me to do.  They are important and I need to make the things important to You important to me.  Thank You for your faithfulness to me.There are so many questions that I wonder about the Bible.  How do I know how to wait while I am trying to figure them out.  I have been trying to figure out some things like:  1) Is the first part of 1 Cor. 11 cultural or literal  2) Is it okay to speak in tongues to oneself in a church service  3) How far must we go to prevent stumbling others  . . . Plus many more.  For example, 1 Cor. 14:34 says, "Let your women keep silent in the churches, for they are not permitted to speak; but they are to be submissive, as the law also says." 1 Tim. 2:11 says, "Let a woman learn in silence with all submission." According to the strongs, silent means silence and churches means a meeting place (jewish synagogue, church) that includes saints of the earth and in HEAVEN.  Yet, this word for woman means wife.  Where do the single women lie in this?  What are we called to do?  Is it possible for when the Bible says the word, "brother" "man" it is really referring to the male gender only?  I ask all of this not to bring more confusion, but to maybe figure it out.  I know that I am called to pray and study out this issues.  However, what do I do while I wait.  Do I be silent or do I continue to speak?  Is it my pride that makes me want to speak?  Or if I stopped to speak, could I end being like the servant that buried his gift in the sand?  I see both sides as not good options.   I just want to serve the Lord and to try to understand what HE wants me to do.  I know that I can't always be able to look, read, and follow.  Yet, I definitely need some more insight on this one.    Tongues? . . . 1 Cor. 14:18-19 "I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; yet in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, that I may teach others also, than then thousand words in a tongue. 1 Cor. 14:16 (Amplified)  "Otherwise, if you bless and render thanks with [your] spirit [thoroughly aroused by the Holy Spirit], how can anyone in the position of an outsider or he who is not gifted with [interpreting of unknown] tongues, say the Amen to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you are saying?" I guess my questions are: Can we not speak in tongues around other people?  Even if it's under our breath?  Can we not speak in tongues when other people are praying (in the known language).  This is what I am seeing in the verses, yet I am not seeing it practiced - even by myself.  Stumbling others. . . How are we supposed to prevent others from stumbling when we don't know what stumbles them?  How do we know if they are healed?  How can we be cautious?  As a group, can we prevent doing certain activities for the benefit of others?  Can we be sensitive to everyone's needs and struggles?  How far should we go for these things?  Just random thoughts. . .Last night I went to Quo Vadis.  We all shared what God has been doing in our lives, and I was able to share how God has been helping me with my fears.  Then, of coarse, comes an opportunity to face one of them.  As we were all talking about playing the jimbay, they asked if I wanted to give it a try.  I said, "No, I don't have rhythm".  It's okay, you just feel it.  "No, seriously, I can't hear it or feel it.  I do not want to play it."  Just when they stopped asking. . .   God says, "Is this another fear?" Me, "Yes, it's pride, huh?" God, "Yes" Me, "Alright, so even if it is Lord, I am not going to overcome it today."  I began thinking of ways I could maybe practice it at home to try it at a later date. Me, "No, I am definitely not going to do it today.  I will look and sound stupid.  I can't keep a rhythm." God, "So, I am helping you over come your fears?  You just told them all about it earlier. How about you actually do what you were talking about.  Overcome it." Me, "I can't get out of it.  Fine one song, that's it."  So, I did.  God finally won.  It was actually fun.  Who would've guessed it.  Micah seems to think I kept the rhythm throughout the song.  I know I messed up a little bit.  But it was actually fun and I did it!  Praise the LORD!  After all, it's all for him anyways.  He doesn't care what it sounds like.  Thinking back, I actually said to God,  "Lord, I am not going to overcome it today."     How can I possibly call Him Lord and not be submissive to His voice.  Isn't the meaning of Lord that I am supposed to submit and serve Him?  Hmmm, as I'm talking to Him, I use an oxymoron.  If I am not submitting to Him, then why call Him Lord?  Hello, that is so dumb of me.  Like calling Him Lord makes my desire of disobedience better or not as bad.  Yet, Jesus is consistent and really desires me to obey, so He did everything He could to help me be obedient.  HE is good and great.  Praise the LORD!, for real this time.Never Underestimate My JESUS You tell me there's no hope I'm telling you you're wrong! Never Underestimate My JESUS When the world around you crumbles You will be strong, You will be strong    Can I be free of this unreleasable sin Overcoming the obstacles are Overcoming my fears    Never underestimate my Jesus  Isn't that the truth?  Lord even though,  "I think I can't, I think I can't,  but I think YOU Can, I think YOU Can!   Gather my Insufficiencies,  place them in Your hands, place them in Your hands." Lord, help me keep them there.  Help me Lord. Thank You for the continuing reminder that You are working on resolving my fears.  Praise You LORD!urlLink   urlLink   urlLink   urlLink1 John 4:4  "You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because   He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world  ."  Oh me of little faith!  Why do I doubt?  Lord give me more faith and hope in You.  Build these things up in me.  Show me what my part is.  Lord, You are awesome and You are love.  Help me be made perfect in love.  ". . . If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us." (1 Jn. 4:12b)  I do not want to fear anyone or anything, make me have perfect love towards all Jesus.  I need to know how You did it.  Shine Your light in me and strengthen me Lord.  I love You.Tonight at home group, the Lord was really teaching me and reminding me of different things.  They seem so milky and at an elementary level of biblical knowledge.  But this is where I am at.  Tonight we studied 1 John 3.  Micah brought up how amazing the first phrase is "  See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us  , that we would be called children of God. . . "  I was thinking, 'yeah, so.  He loves us, but why is that so amazing, we already know this.'  Then God started to show me why it is so amazing.  As I have been dealing with all of these fears, God was telling me, "I love You.  You are My child.  I will protect You like any good earthly father.  I have your best in mind.  I know the best thing for You."  All of a sudden, wow, why do I doubt You Lord.  Why do I doubt who You are and Your love for me?  Lord give me more trust in You.    We also talked a lot about loving other people.  For the past couple of days I have been asking people, do I tell people the truth about the Bible and God's ways when they view me as holy rollers, Molly Mormon, and think I am putting myself on a higher level than them?  So many times when I tell my family something that is concrete in God's word like 1 Jn. 3:6-8, it's black and white and there is nothing anyone can do to change the meaning of it.  Yet, then Grant brought up 1 Jn. 3:18 "Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth."  Telling my family the truth about these things is loving them  in truth .  Even if they don't percieve it as love, it is still love.  Just as David reminded me, I need to pray for them.  I need to pray a whole lot.  Lord help me not give up on my family.  Help me realize You have Your hand on my family's lives and You love them so much more than I do. Micah brought up too that we need to be more open and honest with people.  Answer people's questions truthfully about our lives and not try to make people comfortable.  Chrissy added that if we are more bold with people and they decide to no longer have fellowship with us, then that can be a good thing.  It can show them what exactly is missing in their life.  They might miss it when it's gone.  Today I read about the flood.  It continually shows how Noah obeyed all that God commanded him.  It says how Noah was a righteous man.  Yet, the first thing he did when he got off the ark was get drunk and naked.  The Lord dealt with him accordingly and Noah dealt when Shem accordingly when he looked upon Noah's nakedness.  These chapters really show God's mercy and love in having a remnant of people that was saved.  They also show how the Lord has a balance of His mercy and grace with the need of being obedient to Him.  Lord help me be obedient and remember the promises You have given to me.  Help me rely more upon You.  I love You Lord.Come to find out I have more and more fears approaching daily.  In the past couple of days, I have realized just how many fears I have.  I have the fear of the Lord picking someone for me that I won't like.  I have fear of the unknown.  I have fears of looking stupid (like when I am dancing), which is PRIDE.  I have a fear of not being a good enough witness.  I also have a fear of the demonic realm.  I have a fear that I can't get past all of my fears.   Yesterday I read Proverbs 1.   vs. 33 says, "But whoever listens to me will dwell safely, And will be secure,  without fear of evil ." Luke 12:32 says, "Do not fear, little flock, for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." 1 Tim. 1:7 says, "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind." Psalm 112:7 says, " He will not be afraid of evil tidings ; His heart is steadfast, trusting in the Lord." Isaiah 35:4 says, "Say to those who are fearful-hearted 'Be strong, do not fear!  Behold, your God will come with vengeance, with recompense of God;   He will come and save you  ."  Lord, You give me some awesome promises and resources to rely upon.  Why don't I trust You?  Why do I doubt that You will come and save me?  Why do I doubt that I have been given more power from You than in the demonic realm?  Why do I doubt that greater is You in me than is of the world?  Lord, I admit to you all of my fears, worries, and struggles.  I know I have a lack of faith and trust in You.  You have shown Yourself to be more faithful to me over all situations.  Help me trust You more.  Help me remember all the times You have saved me from myself, danger, and my sins.  Help me remember all the times You have prevented me from making wrong turns in my life.  I praise You for how You have been faithful to me through all of my struggles, and through all of the victories You have helped me achieve.  Lord, continue to be my helper.  Help me go to You for help Jesus.  I love You, and I want to love You even more.  Amen.A while ago, I was reading Exodus 14 and verses 13 and 14 say, "Do not be afraid.  Stand form and you will see the deliverance the Lord will bring you today.  The Egyptians you see today you will never see again.  The LORD will fight for you; you need only to be still."  The Lord fights constantly for all of our battles, especially the spiritual ones within.  He is good and all we need to do is be still and know that He is Lord.    A couple of days ago I read Exodus 35:21, 36:6-7 ". . . Everyone who was willing and whose heart moved him came and brought an offering to the Lord fo rth ework on the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the sacred garments.  All who were willing. .  . . Then Moses gave an order and they went this word throughout the camp:  'No man or woman is to make anything else as an offering for the sanctuary.'  And so the people were restrained from bringing more, because what they already had was  more than enough  to do all the work."  Wouldn't it be nice if this was the problem today.  I think that we need to be wise to who we give to, yet I think it's impossible to give too much to the right source.  Everything I have is God's and I need to remember that.  It's not on loan.  The things that God does give me though, I should go to Him to show me how to use it wisely for His good purpose.1 Corinthians 5:11 "But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner - not even to eat with such a person."   Sounds somewhat simple now, right?  Wrong.  Applying this verse to my life is very hard.  My sister fits these things and now I need to figure out how to be obedient to this.  How much time is it okay to spend with her?  Are my parents supposed to ostricize her out of the family?  I don't know.  My uncle mostly, and also my cousins, probably claim to many people that they are Christians, yet they are drunks.  Am I not to go to any family functions?  Am I supposed to be like my Grandad and just pretend like it's not going on?  This is what I am going to seek out.Just as I think, "most of my questions are getting answered - or at least not as confusing", I get some new questions.  I am beginning to realize,  "THERE IS ALWAYS MORE TO LEARN ABOUT LIVING OUT CHRISTIANITY.  FROM THIS, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE MORE QUESTIONS.  IT'S NOT BAD TO BE QUESTIONING AND FIGURING OUT HOW TO LIVE OUT THE BIBLE.  THIS IS ATTEMPTING TO LIVE OUT LIFE AS A CHRISTIAN."   I have been feeling like I have been legalistic lately, yet I haven't.  I am simply attempting to be obedient to the things the Lord has been convicting me about.  Have I perfected it, no way, I have a long way to go.  Yet, doing things because the bible says so isn't legalistic, it's being obedient to Jesus.       Galatians 3:1-3 says,  "O foolish Galatians!  Who has bewitched you that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?  This only I want to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?  Are you so foolish?  Having begun in hte Spirit, are you now being made perfect by the flesh?"  So basically, I just need to be able to trust in God as I am doing things and not try to do it out of my flesh.  It's a lot easier to not be legalistic than I thought.  Just because others may think I am being legalistic as I am being obedient, doesn't mean it's true.  I can't make my walk decrease because of others misconceptions.  I am not saying this pridefully, I am saying it because it is more important to be obedient to God and please Him by obeying Him than by worrying about what others think about my walk.Sometimes I think "What am I hearing?  Who am I listening to?  How am I supposed to respond to it?"  So then I wonder, what if I am putting these thoughts into my own head.  Maybe, just maybe I want to hear what I want so bad that I say it to myself.  Then I go into the mode, "Maybe my whole way of wanting answers is so clogged up in my head that I couldn't hear God if He was even trying to speak to me."  Then I go to, "Well, God always talks, so Lord, open up and clear my mind that I may hear what You are saying not what I am trying to make myself hear what I want to hear.  I want to know what you desire."  Just a few thoughts that go through my mind, a kind of spiritual warfare.  Jesus promises in John 10:3-4 "To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.  And when he brings out his own sheep, he goes before them and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice."  I know I am His sheep and HE is my shephard.  Even when satan tries to lead me astray or attempts to 'answer' the questions going through my head, I am not going to follow.  This is what this verse means, right?  Yet, Jesus will guide me and show me because I belong to Him and He is going to guide me in the ways in which I shall go.  I am supposed to always be able to discern what He is calling me to do.  Yet, what if I don't want to, then what?  I still belong to Him and my free will takes over.  Now I don't want this to happen, yet I know I choose the other way all the time.  If I didn't I would be sinless, and I am clearly not.  So is this just an honest attempt to show the every-day struggles in my life.  Maybe.  Does it mean it makes since.  Clearly not.  It only makes since to me.  I realize this, yet, I know that when I do discern and be obedient to God, then it makes it easier for me to hear Him the next time.  So, Lord, Help me be obedient to You and hear what You are telling me to do.  All this for, I finally have peace regarding the whole women issue.  I need not to worry about it any more.  The whole conflict in my head was killing me and just confusing me so much that it felt like my mind was leaving my body.  Yet, I have it once again.  Wahoo!  I hope and pray I have the right interpretation this time.  So, I am not to interupt service or teach man.  This is how I now look at this verse. (1 Cor. 14:34-35)  I now have peace and the comfort that the only Lord can fill.  He is good.  After years of trying to study and figure out the verses, I now know what He calls me to follow.My 10 people to pray for: 1.  Kortney and Jeff Keaton 2.  Sarah Vincent 3.  Nick Curzio 4.  Trish Bowman 5.  Chris Lopez 6.  Kathy Cupryk (?) 7.  Merry Darr (?) 8.  Lori Bowman 9.  Mary Adams 10.Brian WhisnantDeuteronomy 6:4-9 "Hear, O Israel!  The LORD is our God, the LORD is one! You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might. These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your sons and shall talk of them when you sit in your house and when you walk by the way and when you lie down and when you rise up. You shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontals on your forehead. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates."  LORD, help me make You my life, and help me follow Your word.Leviticus 5:1  "If a person sins because he does not speak up when he hears a public charge to testify regarding something he has seen or  learned about , he will be held responsible." Numbers 15:30-31  "But anyone who  sins defiantly , whether native-born or alien, blasphemes the Lord, and that person must  be cut off from his people .  Because he has despised the Lord's word and broken His commands, that person must surely be cut off; his guilt remains on him."  1 Corinthians 5:11  "But actually, I wrote to you not to associate with any so-called brother if he is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or a swindler - not even to eat with such a one.  I was wondering if anyone saw a connection between the OT passages and the NT passage.  It almost looks like the 1 Cor. verse is the NT principle from the OT verses.  It's interesting to me that it requires someone to testify even when they learn about it, not just when someone sees it.  God's word is always good, it's not always easy to follow, yet when it is obeyed, the reward is great.Romans 11:32 "For God has shut up all in disobedience so that He may show mercy to all."  It's a shocking verse, but an awesome one.  He wants to show us mercy.  He wants to so badly give us what we don't deserve.  Romans 8:28  "And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose." 2 Timothy 2:13  "If we are faithless, He remains faithful, for He cannot deny Himself."  These scriptures are awesome.  When we are disobedient, He, our awesome Lord and God, is still able to use it in our lives.  From this, we are able to begin to grasp part of His mercy, at least the mercy being shown to us at that particular time.  Praise the Lord that He is even able to use our sins to reveal His holy character to us in our lives!God's love    Micah 7:18  "Who is a God like You, who pardons iniquity And passes over the rebellious act of the remnant of His possession? He does not retain His anger forever,  Because He delights in unchanging love ."  When we think we understand it, it brings us back to the Israelites. If we think we can grasp it or put it to a certain measure (even a big one), we are still minimizing it. The Israelites used to make idols, like themselves, and worship them. There's this song, and it's a good one, and one of the lines is  hold me just like any father would . Yet, I think the song should say,  hold me better than any father would  In a way, it limits God to a human father's standard.  He's God, He can do more. I just don't want to think I understand His love, grace, or mercy. I don't want to minimize them in any way with my own comprehension. I know they are unending, uncircumstantial, and uncomprehensible. I know we have a sovereign God and shows us how He loves us daily.Thank You for my church. Thank You for the awesome families. Thank You for the sweet children that have tremendous gifts. Thank You for Allison who intercedes and prays with faith. Thank You for Jennah who is always willing to help and comfort. Thank You for Raeanna who has a heart to serve. Thank You for the youth who continually surprise me with the servants' hearts. Thank You for the leaders and the examples they set for many to see. Thank You for the examples of families that all share faith in You and follow Your ways. Thank You for allowing a safe place for visitors to come. Thank You for using our church to reach out to the neighboring kids. Thank You Jesus for blessing me with awesome people and a place to come to worship.LORD, Thank You for your goodness and all the blessings You give.  I can't believe how much I need You throughout the day and throughout my life.  I am so stubborn and stupid to ever think I can do anything on my own.  Help me ask You for help and help me lean on You, my sufficiency.  You are my Father and You are my Friend.  Thank you Jesus.  I think the most prideful thing one person can ever do is think they can do it without God or His help.  He is always there to help us, yet many times He is denied entirely.  I don't want to be that stupid."Can't shake the devil's hand and say you're only joking."    This is a line from the song 'Your Racist Friend' by They Might Be Giants on their Flood album.  This is a powerful statement that is so incredibly true.  Many times I will blame my sin on me joking around or goofing off.  Yet, every sin is serious and choosing to shake the devil's hand instead of running toward God.  Something to consider the next time a trial comes. . . .I just wanted to put this in here because it is something I want to remember.  Once again, it's about a simple little prayer of faith from a sweet child.  Kerry Moy told me about a prayer that her daughter, Kendsey, prayed about a week ago.   "Lord, when Joey gets to heaven to be with you, teach him to walk on water like Peter."  As Kerry shared that with Lisa, Joey's wife, she found out that Peter is Lisa's favorite person in the bible.  Praise the Lord with His goodness and how He uses His children.Why is it that the people I expect the least from I see the greatest change?  Why is it the ones I doubt their love for God are the ones with fire burning within their hearts?  Why is it that even when I am  supposed to be in leadership  I still judge people by their appearance and even their character?  Why is it that these are the very ones that God uses within my own life to teach me a few things?  God says that none of us are above one another and not to think of oneself higher than he ought to think.  There were youths last week that showed me what I could have been like in high school if I ever had boldness - if I allowed God to work in my life and didn't try to hide Him everywhere I went.  Praise the Lord for the ones that are shockingly in love with the Lord and desiring to follow Him wholeheartedly."Live in harmony with each other. Don't try to act important, but enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don't think you know it all!"  Romans 12:16 NLT    Can one verse have any more themes?  It was Air1's verse of the day, and since I listen to it ALL day long at work, I heard it many times.  It kept on speaking to me.  It's simple really. Be loving. Be humble. Be teachable.  Enjoy the company of ordinary people is kind of funny to me.  I think it means that people put certain people on pedastals - pastors, elders, leaders in the church.  Yet we don't need to spend all of our time with the godliest of the godly people.  We can simply love on and be friends with anybody.  It goes good with the verse, "don't think of anyone higher than ye ought to think"  Maybe that verse is "don't think of yourself more highly than ye ought to think".  Regardless, I think it applies to both.  We need to be humble and can't think highly of ourselves.  Yet if we elevate others, we will be let down and may end out making them an idol in our lives.  We must be careful and pray for God's help and love to teach us and sustain us."Things don't always work out the way you want them to,  but things always work out the way they are supposed to."  My supervisor from my work said that yesterday.  She has been going through a tough time.  Even though I haven't been through anything bad lately, I think it is still applicable to any situation and anyone.  Ecclessiastes 3:1 says, "To everything there is a time, to everything there is a season."   So many times I will want to know something right away.  Where should I work?  What should I do?  Should I be going to school?  To become a teacher or occupational therapist?  When is the next stage of my life coming?  Yet, it will all come in the time that God has planned and that He allows.  I don't need to worry about anything, it will all happen when it's supposed to - when God wants it to.Tuesday night at home group we were worshipping and then we spent some time just listening to God.  God brought Josh Prior to mind - the guy that interviewed me for a position at Insight.  I didn't know why so I just started praying for him and his walk with God.  God told me that He wanted me to make a commitment to pray for him.  I told Him, "Well, if I get the job that will be easy because I'll see him.  But if I don't get the job than you'll really have to remind me because I'll forget."  God said again, "I want you to commit to pray for him."  "Ok, but please help me remember."  Next, God brought to mind the church directory.  I was trying to find his name in it.  As I was meditating on that, I realized God wants to use me to help draw Josh back to God.  I don't know what kind of walk he has, but I know God wants to increase it.  God wants to use me in some way in Josh's life - whether it's through prayer or through my life - i don't know.  Right now, I just have peace and know God knows.  This is all that matters.  Lord, bless Josh tonight and this weekend.  May You draw him closer to You and show him Your presence.  May he feel Your presence Lord, and may You give him a hunger and thirst for more and more of You.  Thank  You Lord for the work You are doing within him.  Praise You Lord for how You work in all of us in such different ways.  I love You Lord Jesus.I was talking to one of the girls in the youth group, and she was telling me about how she tries so hard to be nice to a girl but the girl just doesn't like in her return.  It made me start thinking.  John 13:34 says, "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another."   We are called to love.  Not just our friends, but also our enemies.  In other words, we're not supposed to love people just so we can get loved back.  We are called to love to be obedient to Christ.  That is all we can do.  For those people that just might not like our personalities or that we may have hurt in the past - just love them.  Continue to show them the love of Christ.  That is enough.  There's nothing else we can do.  This is something that we can rest in.  It may or may not effect the relationship with that person.  Yet, we can rest in the fact that we are being obedient to our Lord - Adonai.Today I went and washed my car.  But, only the outside of it got clean.  I told myself that I would clean out the inside of it later.  But hey - it looks clean, right?  I immediately thought about how people might try to appear clean on the outside, to the people around them.  However, in order to be truly clean spiritually is to be clean on the inside.  Continually repenting and confessing to the Lord, letting the Word wash us clean by the power of the Spirit and of the blood.    We can't just appear clean, we need to be cleaned by God.Last night I had a dream that I was at ASU East.  I saw an old friend from junior high and we were talking in the parking lot with someone from church.  Then, all of a sudden, everyone in the parking lot began singing and signing  I Can Only Imagine  by Mercy Me.  It was an awesome picture on a secular campus.    Romans 15:9-11 "and for the Gentiles to glorify God for His mercy; as it is written, 'Therefore I will give praise to You among the Gentiles, And I will sing to Your name.' And again he says, 'Rejoice, O Gentiles, with His people.' And again, 'Praise the Lord all you Gentiles, And let all the peoples praise Him.'"Influence.  It is a powerful thing. Paul was able to say "Imitate me as I imitate Christ". I see people with a huge amount of influence on the people around them. I see the people that look to them and are taking on the other person's behavior. It can be a very bad thing if they are imitating the wrong parts of someone's character. When we are in a position where people look to us as how Christians are supposed to act and look, we need to make sure that we are representing Christ as dear children.   It doesn't mean that we need to pretend we're perfect.  It simply means that when we make mistakes, we choose how to respond correctly and with integrity. May all of us youth leaders be the appropriate influence on the youth, that they may desire to draw closer to God and yearn to spend more time with Him.Last Wednesday at Youth Group, Allison and Jake did an awesome skit.  Allison went around and gave every person a candy bar, and Jake had to do 5 push-ups for them to get their candy.  After Jake had done quite a few push-ups, people stopped wanting their candy.  But, Jake still did push-ups for them even if they didn't want their free candy.  Every time someone was getting their piece of candy, Jake would look at them and say, "Ok".  It affected me so much because some of those kids that were there he doesn't even know their names.  Yet, he would look at them and then do his 5 push-ups for them.  His arms started hurting really bad, but he would just stretch and then do more.  In the end, Jake did 180 push-ups.  He continually did them faithfully until we made him stop.  Allison then said, sometimes actions mean more than words.  This is just a little glimpse of what the cross should mean to us and what Jesus went through.  We felt bad for Jake after about 30 push-ups.  Yet, Jesus wasn't even recognizable as a human when He was put onto the cross.  It was an awesome picture of what an average person can do to serve people, yet it can't even compare to the price that Jesus paid for us.  Thank you Lord for all that You went through.  I love you Jesus."I am addicted to you"  I heard this line in a secular song.  It's awesome, if it's about God.  I want to be addicted to God, to the point that I would be:  *Sick without Him *Depend upon Him to make me happy and give me joy *He is the one that controls my life *Everything about my life is revolved around Him *All of my money is His and spent where He desires *I would not go long without spending time with Him  Jesus, You are the One thing I want to be addicted to.  You are the Lord of my life and I want don't want You to just be the center of my life.  I want You to be my life.  I want to be addicted to You.  I want you to be in my thoughts and heart continually.  I want my mind to be focused upon You and heavenly things.  I praise You and thank You for being my Father, my Saviour, and my Redeemer.The other night I got to babysit my little cousin, Dakota.  She clearly wasn't tired, but I had to put her to sleep - it was already 10:00.  At about 10:30, she was just lying in her crib and talking galore.  To who?  I have no idea.  Then I heard her say, "Thank you for Hannah, Mommy, Daddy, Dakooota."  Then she kept on saying all of our names again.  It was so sweet.  Perhaps she was praying.  I don't know, but this encouraged me that the Lord has His hand on her life.God created the moon and the stars to be the light in the world admist the darkness.  Saturday night I was in a church service and the Lord showed me how this is an example how God can use His creation to teach the church.  Just as Timothy and Silas helped Paul raise his hands (maybe this was Stephen), God has the body of a church lift up the arms of their pastor.  We can do this by praying for them, tithing, and supporting him in the decisions he makes.  The pastor can represent the moon and the church body represents all of the stars.  God promised Abraham in Genesis that his decendents would be as numerous as the stars. (Genesis 15:5, Hebrews 11:12)  In the same way, we all work together to be the light admist this darkened world.  Philippians 2:15 "that you may become blameless and harmless, children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world."  Let us all strive to be the lights of this world and to support our leaders as God has called us to do.Sometimes I wonder what all God is doing in my life.   I can seem Him working, and I can hear Him speaking.  Why is it that I will doubt when He does?  Why is it that are certain things that He wouldn't speak to me about?  All day Sunday, I was wondering who was going to be proving the childcare during the Danny Daniels seminar.  I felt that God had told me to work with the kids if they needed help.  As always, the faithful youth were in the nursery.  They are awesome servants.  Yet, Paul and Erin were with all the other ages.    When I arrived at the church, I pulled in right behind the Greens.  Zarah saw me and she just stared.  After I had caught up with her family, she was still staring and then her family started walking.  Finally after I started talking to her, she began walking as well.  I decided I was going to go in so I can talk to her and her brother John.  She insisted that I had to stay in there with her.  Once again, God uses a child to confirm what He had been speaking to me all day.    It was such a blessing, every child there was a blessing.  It was definitely a 3 person task, 2 people just wouldn't have been able to watch all of the children and to play with them.  Thank You God for the little gifts that You give to me.  Thank You for that gift on Sunday night.This has been a very weird week for me.  Monday night Kristen came up to me and said she just wanted to apologize for how she was mean to me at camp.  I must say, there are things I would change when it comes to my behavior towards her that week.  Yet, she apologized and I was in awe.  It was so random and heartfelt.  I owed her an apology as well.  Then the next night, I went to homegroup.  The first think little Allison Lott said to me was, "Hannah, I am so sorry for all the times that I wasn't nice to you."  I reassured her that she has been really nice to me lately.  She responded with "I know but there were times where I wasn't nice to you.  And I am sorry.  I shouldn't have treated you that way."  She's 4!  I was mind boggled.  Lord, what are You trying to teach me through all of this?  Should I be more forgiving and give more random acts of kindness?  Are you trying to show me that You love me?  Is this just part of the body of Christ and how we are to love one another?  Is this a time of receiving?  But Lord, I have been receiving so much lately!  Whatever it is You are trying to teach me, You are blessing me in the process.  I love how You use Your children - and sometimes little children - to teach me things.  I just love You Lord for You are good and You know how to give presents to Your children.  Thank You Lord for these.Last week at home group, Kim said,   God gives you the desires of your heart, after He puts His heart in you.   It's really true.  I can see it with my jobs.  The Lord put special needs children within my heart.  He told me to work with them and now they are forever in my heart.  Even though I don't work with them full time anymore, there's a part of my heart that belongs to them.  Working with them part time is a way in which the Lord continues to give me the desires of my heart.    That same night we went through an exercise where we write something down that we want to hear from God on and that we want answered.  Then we wrote what we would hope for the answer to be, what we wouldn't want the answer to be, and then the details of what we want the answer to be.  That week, my prayer was on where I should work.  Exactly one week later, I found out that I got the job I had applied for.  Some of the details that were answered: A job that pays atleast $24,000 a year (this pays $23,500 - close enough for me) A job that has benifits (yeah) A place that I can be a witness (Insight has a lot of drunkards) Some of the details that will be answered in time: A place/ job that I will enjoy A place that I can learn and not be bored A place that I can be creative Someone that I can move out with   God sees the answers of our hearts questions.  We may not see or hear them when we ask, but they are still there.  God just wants to bless us immensely - and He's really good at that.  Why is having patience so hard at times?Sunday in the toddler room, there were only two kids!  Wooh, it was so rough!  The three of us in there could barely handle it!  Anyways, during the story, I asked them if they knew how much Jesus loved them.  Joshua said, "I love baby Jesus this much!" and he opened up his arms as far as he could.  Then Savanna said, "I love baby Jesus this much!" and then she opened her arms up as far as she could.  They continued to repeat this taking turns.  It was almost as if they were fighting over who loves baby Jesus more!  It was so precious.  It's so awesome to see how kids show their love to God.  That was a completely different situation than when I watched 15 1-4 year olds on the 12th.  Cela watched 13 5-12 year olds, and she had it just as bad.  We were essentially on our own because we divided up the kids.  I truly could barely handle it!  Yet, I don't know how I would have been able to without the older kids that love to help - Katelyn, Jennah, Isaiah, Adi, and Katarina.  They wet paper towels and toilet paper to make wipes.  They did all they could to help.  Once again, they each wanted a turn to make a wipes for me - I could never say I had enough - until each of them made me one.  Poor babies (Annah, Melissa, and Eliana) that had to suffer through so many cold wipes everytime their diaper was changed!  Praise You Lord for giving gifts to Your children and using people of such young ages to bless me and help me.  They are awesome and it is so evident that each of them are wonderfully and perfectly made!Wow, it's been a while since I've posted last. . . . . .   Well, a lot has been happening.  Probably too much to talk about all at once, but I'll try.  On Christmas Eve my sister was saying that she had been having contractions for the past two days.  Chris and I took her to the hospital (because they were SO bad)!  We found out that she was almost 3 cm dialated, but because she didn't change during the four hours that we were there, they sent her home.  She wasn't able to sleep all night because they were progressively getting worse and they were coming every five minutes.  At 7:30 Christmas morning, she insisted we go back to the hospital.  She said, "Either this baby is coming out or they are giving me some strong medicine because they are 10x worse than they were last night.  I had no idea that it could hurt this bad."  Well, she was then dialated to 4 cm so they called her doctor and had him come in.  (Her doctor was out so guess what his replacement doctor's name was - Dr. Seymann - pronounced semen).  :)  Well, I guess he's in the right field!  Anyways, they soon gave her an epideral, I guess it's about 9:30 about.  Then they broke her water at about 10:30.  I went home about eleven because she was just going to sleep for a little bit so she would have energy later.  At about 1:00 Chris called me and said, you better hurry, she's going to be here in 10 minutes!  Well, I got there and there wasn't a doctor or even a nurse in the room.  But she was dialated to a negative 2.  The RN had thought that she was just going to come out without any pushing.  Sarah was pretty well off, but she did have to push - for a whole 25 minutes!  She lucked out but she was still in pain.  I must say, it was a beautiful thing to experience, and the miracle of birth is truly that - a MIRACLE!  After little Lilia came out at 2:12 p.m. Christmas day, she started crying and then all of a sudden she stopped.  When she came out she started crying so fast that some of the amniotic fluid went into her mouth, and she swallowed a lot of it!  She started turning blue and I think 7 nurses came in all surrounding her and taking the fluid out of her.  It was pretty intense and scary, but I don't think we really understood it at the time.  I just kept taking pictures.  So, they took her up to the Neonatal ICU and watched her there for about and hour, hour and a half.  We found out she was 5 pounds 14 1/4 ounces and 18 3/4 inches long.  She is so tiny, but perfect and complete.    Ever since then it has been bonding time with everyone!  She has already starting to show off and showing some expressions.  She loves having her arms straight up and stretching.  She is such a good baby so far.  She hardly cries, and yet it is still kind of hard to claim as a cry - it's so quiet.  She is so tiny that the shirt the hospital gave her fell off of her shoulder and her arm came out of the sleeve.  Anyways, she is a huge blessing, and my whole family is so happy that she's healthy, sweet, and SO cute!  Well, I better get more rest so I can spend more time with her tomorrow!\Fa"vor*ite\, n. [OF. favorit favored, F. favori, fem. favorite, p. p. of OF. favorir, cf. It. favorito, frm. favorita, fr. favorire to favor. See Favor.] 1. A person or thing regarded with peculiar favor; one treated with partiality; one preferred above others; especially, one unduly loved, trusted, and enriched with favors by a person of high rank or authority.  Thank you Ben for the link on your blog.  So, is it really bad to have favorites?  Hmmm. . . I have a lot of favorites, and really, the more I start to get to know a particular 'youth', they become one of my favorites.   It's really not that hard.  Yet, I do have favorites of my favorites.  (sshhhh)  Yet, each of us are God's favorites.  We can each say He favors us with partiality (it's called mercy).  So my philisophical argument is:  God has favorites. We are God's favorite. Other's are God's favorite. Therefore, We can have favorites because they are God's favorites too.  We are each the apple of His, He keeps us in the palm of His hand, He knows the number of hairs on our head, He loves us.  He really loves us.My (daughter), pay attention to what I say;  listen closely to my words. Do not let them out of your sight, keep them within your heart;  for they are life to those who find them and health to a man's whole body. Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life. Put away perversity from your mouth;  keep corrupt talk far from your lips. Let your eyes look straight ahead, fix your gaze directly before you. Make level paths for your feet and take only ways that are firm. Do not swerve to the right or the left; keep your foot from evil.  Proverbs 4:20-27  NIV  Sometimes I think it would be really nice for God to say, "Hey, pay attention Hannah to what I am saying."  I would probably obey Him a little more, I would definitely have less questions on what His will would be.  Yet, it might seem a little harsh if He did it too often.  It's just for those faith building moments . . . . when you have to take a risk. . . . and really trust that you heard His voice. . . . and that it's time to be obedient.  Yet, this is why I need to keep my eyes looking straight ahead, gazing them at the Lord.  I don't want to stumble or fall.  So, sometimes I'll take the easy road, sometimes I'll take the hard road, but hopefully it's the road that I will be able to look to Jesus for His help, strength, perserverance, and endurance to help me through it all.At times I have wondered:  am I dedicated more to the toddlers than the youth?  I have realized that I talk about the toddlers with the youth and I hope they don't think I love the younger kids more than I love all of them.  But then I realized, it's not like I can talk to the toddlers about the youth.  They wouldn't be able to follow or understand the concepts of the different ways in which the youth bless me.  I have realized that I enjoy both ministries so much and that they both bless me immensely.  I enjoy seeing the toddlers grow into their little persons and personalities and the different things they learn about God.  I love hearing 5 or 6 kids pray over the snack.  I loved when they remembered that Jonah went to Ninevah (that's a hard word to say).  I love when they all participate and listen to my 15 - 20 minute story / lesson.  As for the youth, I love seeing them worship, and I love seeing the way that some of the S.A.L.T. youth really do step up - like Jake Roessler when it comes to Darian, Zach, and so many others, and Joanna with all she does with her letters and planning of events, and Liz, Lindsey, and Kristen with the way they are so dedicated and always willing to step up and serve, and Jake Mullins with how diligent is is to clean the church, no matter if he feels like it, and James with his heart of worship.I have realized how much I love my Alpha group.  It's awesome to see some of the girls open up.  Each week, there are a few things that are constant:  Kristen - prayer requests for her Mormon friends and for a puppy. Sarah G. - prayer requests for her friends (there's always a spiritual battle) Danielle - always ready to read God's word, usually the first to pray of the youth Emily - always has a laugh attack, and then makes Kristen join in.  There are some gifts that I have seen in them and that became obvious to me last week when we were talking about the Holy Spirit:  Emily - intercessory prayer Kristen - children Sarah - compassion Danielle -  definitely has one, but can't think of it right now (might edit later)  Some of the other ways that the "sparatic" girls have blessed me:  Melissa - all of her questions of truly wanting to understand the Bible; her concern for the lost in other religions Kelly - her curiousity and spunk Megan - her love for people and animals (Lord please be with Megan's and keep Kelly's ferrets from running away)  Lord, thank You for my Alpha group and the girls you had Ben place in it.  I ask you Lord to continue to be with me and Kerri as we lead and show us the things You would desire for us to teach and discuss with the girls.  I ask You Lord to open us all up to share our trials and failures as well as the way you use us and help us overcome.  I love You Lord.Damian and Darian - they are cool kids.  I needed help to bring in groceries yesterday.  They were talking to their friends, but I let them know that I needed their help.  Without finishing their conversation, they stopped and came outside and then brought all of the eggs in.  They have also helped me out in the toddler room.  It's great when the different ministries you are in can mix together like that.   They serve - and I love that they help with Super Church and it's kept on the down low.  I have also served with both Kristen and Lindsey in the toddler room as well.  They both have the gift of children - if that makes sense.  They totally bless me.  I love being able to see the kids serve - and wholeheartedly!  Last night at the Renaissance, there was only 3 kids.  At snack, I asked them if anyone wanted to pray.  Addi said she did, then Kyndahl volunteered, and then her older sister, Bailie, said she wanted to pray too.  So, they all prayed.  It was awesome because the two sisters prayed for all of the children in Phoenix Children's Hospital and everyone that's sore.  That's awesome!  I think I am going to pick an organization like that to start praying for.  Hmmm. . . why did Jesus tell us we need to have the faith of a child?Lately, I have been thinking that I have been experiencing some spiritual warfare.  Most of the time when I am experiencing it, I don't even recognize that I am in it until it is over.  Yet, it has been so strong that I have been recognizing that I am experiencing it, and it just didn't seem to ever stop.  I think that it's finally over.  The past month and a half or two months have been really hard.  I have been noticing my trials, praying about them, asking for God to help me fight these spiritual battles, and in the end - I think that they are conquered.  Only through God are all things possible.  Thank You Lord, You are truly a very good GOD!Last night, I went to Central Christian's college group.  I had many preconceived thoughts about what it was going to be like from conversations with different people.  I was expecting a really big room, maybe filled with a lot of expensive furniture, decorated nicely (but hip), and filled with a bunch of young Christians that just hop from one another like it's a dating show.  (Yes, this is really what I expected)  Then, I show up.  It's in a small room, there are maybe 50 chairs set up, and I felt like the young one, where most people appeared to be 30-40.  Mostly everyone seemed pretty mature and were actually nice.  Why do I listen to other's opinions?  Why would they influence me to not to go to something where I am able to be in fellowship with believers?  I just don't really know.  However, I still felt awkward at first.  Yet, it was just like everything I have been used to.  It fits right in with the Vineyard and Calvary setting that I am used to.  Afterwards, we went to the Coffee Plantation.  I haven't really been comfortable yet.  I had been judging the place like I wasn't there experiencing it, but as if I was an outsider looking in.  Then I see Mandy there at the coffee shop.  Even though I have been with Jessica all night, I finally feel comfortable.  Seeing her there was just a simple boost of familiarity and somehow made my shyness go away.  Once I got over my preconceived thoughts and feelings, I was able to talk to some people - with realness.  They were really nice.  I was able to have fellowship with them.  I think it's awesome that believers are simply that - believers in Christ.  We can all come from different backgrounds and churches, yet we have gone though similar trials, similar experiences, and we worship the same GOD to help us through it all.  It is HE who is so faithful.  It is HE who will be faithful to us even when we are unfaithful or faithless, because HE cannot deny HIMSELF.  Even though it ended out being a blessing last night, when I got to church this morning, I became so happy.  There are so many people that I love at my church - so many people that just make me smile or laugh at the sight of them.  I am so thankful that God has allowed me to be apart of a fellowship like this.  I also love God for how He really works all of our lives together for the good of the church - both the universal and local.The Passion of the Christ  Praise You Lord that You are able to be seen in our secular world.   Praise You that You always reveal Yourself to this darkened world. Praise You that You save all people, from the beggars to the stars. Praise You Lord that You died so that ALL may live and share life in You.  This movie was very good.  It was pretty accurate, and I think that they did an amazing way of interpreting the scriptures and putting them into a film.  There were some parts that were hard to watch, yet it is no where near as gory as it should have been.  Jesus was scourged 39 times (3 separate times) - that's a total of 108 scourges at that one time (?).  It was illegal to scourge someone 40 times, so they would always punish people 40 - 1.  Yet, Jesus was not recognizable as a human.  He was the perfect sacrifice - the slaughtered lamb, that the ravenous wolves came and feed upon.  Yet, this is the only way our sins could ever be forgiven.  I must say it was very hard for me to watch some of the scenes in that movie, yet they don't even really compare to the reality of it.  You had it so much worse Jesus.  This was the last 12 hours of Christ's life, yet we watched it in two.  I don't know how You did it Lord.  You truly are an Amazing God.  Thank You Lord for all that You did just because there would be no forgiveness of sins without the shedding of blood.  Praise You Lord for Your goodness, Your mercy, and Your  grace !  Isaiah 53:11b - 12 By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many, for He shall bear their iniquities.  Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great, and He shall divide the spoil with the strong, because He poured out His soul unto death, and He was numbered with the transgressors, and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.Who is harder on us?  God or ourselves?  At work, I don't think that there is a single Christian around me - well maybe one or two - the two new guys that started about a month ago.  Yet, it is so amazing to hear the words that come out of the mouths of my other teammates.  To call God a she and for someone to say they are not worried about heaven but they just want to make their customer's happy. . . other people celebrate how long they haven't gone to church. . . there are two mormon's on my team. . . . and others just love their sinful lives, they might not be happy, but they sure do love all of their sins.   Once I began to see how lost everyone around me is, I wanted to try to make more of an effort to be available for God to use me there.  If by some way I could be a light to the people around me, I want it to be done.  I want to shine.  Yet, there are so many times that I get stressed out. . . . especially lately.  I felt like I was yelling at people on the phone (HP, Qlogic).  I would also say things about other people that are so not edifying.  Yet, Friday one of the people I work with told me that she could tell when I get stressed out by the way that I sit.  She also told me that she has never heard me be mean to anyone.  Yes I have. . . to her even.  How could she forget the way that I was rude to her just the week before.  How could she overlook all of the times I would demand service from a manufacturer or another reseller?  Maybe I'm not yelling, but I'm just being assertive.  Whatever, they are pretty much the same to me.  Yet, was she telling me in her own subtle way that I may still be used as a light. . . can people really overlook my flaws and still see Jesus in me?  I know Jesus forgives me for my sins, but I still feel like a failure as a light. . . Yet, maybe God was trying to show me that I can still be used. . . that He can go past all of my weaknesses and still use me in my job.  Praise You Lord for that.  I know that my job has been used by God to teach me a few things.  When I first started working with special needs children, I did not want to do it because I didn't have the patience for it.  Then God told me, "And I can't give you patience?".  Not that I am the most patient person in the world, but I must say that God has followed through with His word.  When it comes to kids, I can be pretty patient - it doesn't matter the rate at which they develop.  They are kids, and I can understand why they do some of the things they do that can try us.  Yet, with adults, I have a lot less patience.  I think because I expect more out of them.  One day, I think after I got off the phone with Austin from Bubbles Car Wash, (I hope he's not a blogger). . .God told me, "I have given you patience with kids, now you need to trust Me to give you patience with adults."  Is there a better place for that then customer service?  I think not.  The past week has been evident that God has been working that in me. . . I have been a lot less stressed out and nicer to people.   Another funny thing is ever since I have bought things on my own, I have never been one to return anything.  I don't know why, maybe because I felt bad about returning it or maybe I thought the people would get mad at me for it. . . Kind of funny that I work in the returns department and allow people to return things everyday.  It was when I was shopping for my new bedroom that I started to realize what God was doing.  I had bought a sheet set at Walmart and some pillowcases.  It wasn't until I was making my bed when I realized that the sheet set came with pillow cases.  I didn't need any extra, and so I should return the extra pillowcases, right?  I didn't even have to think about it, I just did it.  I returned them.  Then, it was after I left with my money that I realized that God is doing yet another work in me.  He has given me more confidence and shown me that He can use all aspects of my job to help me grow spiritually.  He can also use me with the people around me.  It's amazing  how God works!Few people actually know about how spiritually unhealthy it was for me to be living with my parents.  At times, I began to take on my parents bad characteristics.  I took on my mom's insecurities and my dad's temper.  It's not a good combination - trust me!  Then I had an offer to move in with the Cloud's.  I had been wanting that for quite some time, people had told me in the past that it would be a great place for me to live.  Yet, I would never want to burden anyone or for them to feel obligated to help me out.  I also didn't want for it to look like I was making a big deal out of nothing about my parents.  It's just kind of hard to explain.  They have never encouraged me to seek the Lord.  In fact, when I was younger and I would come home from church camp - I was always so hungry for the Word.  If I went in my room and read my Bible, my dad would get mad at me.  He missed me after me being gone for a week, and he felt that I could always read my Bible later.  It was always more important to spend time with him than for me to read the Bible or do a study.  Sometimes he would say, why don't you read in here or study in here.  Other times, I think he felt convicted and he would say, you should probably do that in the other room.  It was always a stressful situation, and no matter what I did - I always failed them.  Now I live with the Clouds.  Even though I don't see them much - it makes me so happy to go home at night.  It is so much for healthy spiritually.  Just to see how they all relate with each other is awesome.  Last Saturday, everybody was home.  It was so cute to see how Jennah was playing with Mandy, and Noah was playing with Ben.  Then, Noah was playing with Mandy, and Jennah was playing with Ben.  They continued switching parents and playing with each other.  Both kids and parents were getting individualized attention from the other.  Then, they all played together a game of Crazy 8's.  It was such a blessing to be able to observe that.  I love living there, and I must say I never thought that I could be blessed this much.  I don't think that I could ask for a better living situation for me.  They are truly an awesome, incredible family.Thank you Lord for You are good, Your mercy endures forever.  Praise you for everything You did in the youth, for using us leaders, and for blessing us beyond comprehension this weekend.  Your children are beautiful, and You are a very creative God.  Be with us this week, and continue all of the works you are doing within the youth.  Continue to raise them up into leaders and call us to a high standard that we may be able to be examples to them.    Thank You for You are a very good God!  :)Sometimes it is good just to notice creation - to look around at the amazingness of God's creatures.  For a few weeks, I was seeing birds everywhere.  They were always doing something that just absolutely amazed me.   One time they were all in a tree that had no leaves on its branches.  I thought it was just a normal tree that was covered with leaves.  Then, as I got closer, I realized that the tree was just completely filled with birds.  Another time I saw the birds playing a game.  There was a few of them, and lets say they were in order 1, 2, and 3.  Then bird one would fly and then the order would be 2, 3, 1.  Then bird two would fly and the order would then be 3, 1, 2.  It was so funny because they just kept flying and taking turns like they were playing a game with each other.    They also seem to have their own friends and family.  I saw a few trees all in a row.  Two of the trees pretty much had the same amount of birds in them.  Then one would fly to the other tree.  A few seconds later, more would fly to the other tree.  Eventually, almost all of the birds were in the one tree. .. at least until my traffic light turned green.   Birds are seriously so facinating to watch, as boring as a "bird watcher" would sound.  Yet, it's neat to see that other creatures can have personalities too.  Just remember, God say he takes care of even the sparrow and they always have their food.  Yet, they were always the birds that were looked upon as evil.com?mu?ni?ca?tion    ( P )  Pronunciation Key  (k-myn-kshn) n.  1.The act of communicating; transmission.  2.The exchange of thoughts, messages, or information, as by speech, signals, writing, or behavior.  Interpersonal rapport.   The whole e-mail, blogging, text messenging, instant-messenger, and chat room scene. . . . Is this a superficial or real form of communication?  By definition, it is a form of communication. . .Yet, there are all the normal things that are usually obvious that we miss because of this form of communication:  body language, tone, expression, and the such.  Is it possible that we may get along with someone perfectly fine or even really well in an on-line setting but we might be at each other's throats if we met them in person?  Is it possible that you can't truly get to know someone without seeing their expressions and the such or even know their smell?  There is a definite positive side of it all . . . Sometimes it is easier to witness to someone you have never seen. . . It also gives you time to think and respond with prayer. .. I also get to see the different depths of my friends that I don't always get to see otherwise. . . Sometimes it is easier to type something than to say it outloud.  There are some things that we all know from each other by just our first impression of them. . . without a face to face encounter, that whole step is missed and it leaves us with preconceived ideas and notions about the other person.  Is this fair?  Can they be correct?  I really just don't know how I feel on this matter.  I really wish I had comments, because I really want to know what people think. . .Sometimes I am amazed at God's goodness. . . Sometimes I forget to even notice His overwhelming goodness. . . I wonder why. . . Is it the busyness around me or even within?  Is it the different things that I put as a priority in my life?  Although I love all the things that make me busy. . . . it is definitely good to be able to rest at times.    LORD. . . . .  Help me not miss the beauty of Your creation. Help me not miss the small things in people's lives. Help me not miss the things You have called me to do. Help me not miss the promises You have given. Help me not miss the simeple things of love that You do. Help me not miss the gifts that You have given. Help me not miss the beauty You have put in each person. Help me not miss the rest that You give. Help me not miss the peace You try to give - and I don't receive. Help me not miss the strength You give to meet my needs. Help me not miss Your greatness, beauty, mercy, grace. . . .  I need Your grace. I desire Your mercy. I love Your character. I hope in Your promises. I long for Your love. I hunger for Your word.  I need Your strength. I desire You. I love Your goodness. I hope in Your beauty. I long for Your guidance. I hunger for Your Spirit.  Thank You my God and my Lord, the all in all in my life.  Thank You for what You give to me every second of every day.  For this I thank You and I love You.  Your are more precious than words can ever try to explain. . . . . .Sometimes I don't know if I can handle the things around me.  I see the hurt that these people are going through and have gone through and I ache.  My chest hurts and feels bruised, my heart is beating faster and I am in physical pain for what I have seen people at work go through.  Michael has had a horrible life and if I had went through all of that. . . I wonder if I could believe at all. . . . would I be an atheist if I had his life?  Does God just have His hand on some of us more than He does on others?   I don't know, but Lord, please heal him for all of the things he has been through.  I know he says that he is okay, but I just don't know how he could be.  I know he is a strong person, but please Lord, help him become vulnerable to you.  Touch his heart, touch his life, comfort and heal him.  Give him the hope only you can give and be with him throughout this day.  I love You Lord, and I ask You to touch him today.  As for Megan, she is going through so much as well Lord.  Please continue to work with her and help her not being comfortable with the decision she has made in the past in regards to her current situation.  Continue to help her and show her that You can be her strength and source.  You can be her provider for all of her physical, emotional, and personal needs.  Oh Lord, be with her in the decisions she has - please Lord, help her make the one You would desire for her.   Thank you Lord for wanting to take on all of my burdens as well as the burdens of others.  I lift myself up to You and ask You to continue to give me the words to say, the compassion to comfort, and the wisdom to share.  Use me and take control of all these situation.  Thank You for Your goodness and the amount of love that You give to me.  I am so glad that I have a God that is too good to imagine. . . . Thank You Lord.  I love You.Abraham  Sometimes there are youth that seem like their walks are stagnant.  Then - there comes a slight change.  Abraham has always stood by his friends and talked during worship and the lesson.  Yet, Sunday, they brought friends and yet, he went up a few feet in front of them and stood by himself during worship.  He focused on God and set himself apart from his comfort zone.  The, during the lesson, he was by himself again, and he was intently listening to Obie as he was teaching and giving examples.  I saw the posture of his spirit and the hunger in his eyes, and God was moving, teaching, and working within his life.  Praise you Lord for the ways that You are molding Abraham.  May You continue to work within his life and increase his hunger and thirst for You.Sometimes the Lord does more than we can imagine.  Sometimes He uses us despite of ourselves, our abilities, and our weaknesses.  God is so good.  From time to time I wonder, am I being a light in my workplace?  Do others see Jesus in me?  Why do I work at Insight?   Is this really where God wants me?  Am I a true imitator of Christ?  Then, there are days like a few weeks ago.  Megan asks, "So, have you always believed in God and gone to church?"  Which, when translated into Christianese is "Tell me your testimony".  That was awesome.  Then, there are days like last Friday.  Jason and Megan are talking about how much I know the two of them and about the two of them.  Jason is worried that I know too much about him.  Then Megan says to him, "Hannah does not know everything about either of us.  I would never tell her everything because then she would not like either one of us."  To them, my opinion of them matters.  Why?  Yet, they know my character.  They know that I do not cuss and that I would not used the Lord's name in vain.  It's to the point that if she overhears me say something that sounds like it, Megan questions what I said.  Thank you Lord that she knows what I desire my character to be.  Then, there are days like today that still shock overwhelm me and my understanding.  I still want to pinch and slap myself and know that it is real.  I have befriended this guy named Michael lately.  Not very many people like him, but for some reason, our personalities click - maybe because we are both open books.  He saw the Passion of the Christ this past weekend, and that began our day long conversation about our belief/ lack of belief in God.  Throughout the time I have spend getting to know him, I could not figure out where his beliefs lie.  Today I found out.  He is an atheist.  He was a baptist until the age of 17 or 18 where he lost all his faith.  Today we talked about Jesus being 100% God and 100% human, the trinity, and the neverending debate of creation vs evolution.  He shared his heart with me, the things that effected his paradigm, and he was completely vulnerable.  In our conversation, he said things like "spoken like a true Christian" "I try to learn as much as I can" "I believe Jesus Christ existed, I always have" "when I had found out what had happened, it effectively killed any faith I had left" finally "well its nice to communicate with a person that isn't as much of a religious fanatic as most.  that's cool that you feel the way you do and I respect that entirely.  I just wanted to say that I enjoyed this very much."  Wow - you mean an atheist enjoyed talking about Christianity and God ALL day long?    Lord, please continue to soften Michael's heart.  Please heal him and his family through all of the emotional and spiritual scars that they have.  Show him that You exist and that You desire to poor Your love into his life.  Provide for him the evidence he needs to know that You Jesus are the Son of God and You are God and the Creator of this world. Lord, I also want to pray for Megan and Jason.  Continue to help them through all of their problems.  Continue to allow them to trust me and confide in me.  Use me in any way You seem fitting.  Thank You Lord for my job and the opportunities that You have given me.  You are truly an amazing God and when You do the things You do, I can barely contain myself and not stand up and scream, rejoices that You are a God that moves in peoples lives.  Continue to guide them in their steps and the hard predictaments that they are in.  Thank You for the love that You have for them and myself.  I love You for when You use me and when I feel like I am not being used.  I give You glory for everything You have been doing.  I praise You Lord,  please help me praise You with every aspect of my life.Throughout my friendship with Megan, she has had certain preconceived thoughts about me and my beliefs. Which can be good. . . What amazes me the most is this:  We were talking about our past roommates and how we love where we live know.  We talked about the drama of girls and the different types of personalities and little synocracies that they have.  After I told her about my first apartment and roommates, she ended the conversation with "Well, no wonder you turned to God."  It just mind boggles me that she, a "heathen", can recognize that.  I was totally blown away. I think that she is starting to see that God can help us and take us out of some troublesome circumstances. . . She is also going to read, The 5 Love Languages, along with her mom.  They both are excited about it.  They know that it's a Christian book and yet, they still want to read it.  Please Lord, may You use Your WORD that is in that book to change them, enlighten them, and give them hunger for You.  I ask You Lord to draw them to You and to speak to them.  Please Lord, give them the gift of faith.Tonight Set Apart came and played for the youth.  It was so stinkin' awesome to see two great bands come together and worship the Lord like that.  They brought new kids to church that we might not have been able to reach otherwise.  It's incredible the way music can really move people and speak to them.  Everyone in this band totally has a heart for the Lord and it's great to be able to witness how God uses other people.   Lord, I just ask you Lord to bless this new band, bless the previous members of both Bloodbaught and Dunamis and use them mightily for Your kingdom.  May You continue to guide them in every aspect of their lives and with the band.Last night at youth was awesome.  Sometimes I wonder how many kids we actually make an impact on, individually.  Then Juanca came up to me and told me that he missed me, because I have been gone for so long.  (I only missed one Wednesday and one Sunday).  He is so silly.  It makes me wonder though, how much time do I actually spend with the little guy?  I should maybe spend a little more. . .   Yet, worship at the end of the night was incredible.  First, it was an awesome blessing to see Vanessa be strong and worship with her heart "on stage".  Then, there was this kid right in front of the stage in the dead center. . .I don't remember his name, I think he may be friends with Jared Shipman. . .but he was worshipping his heart out throughout the songs, raising his hands, lifting his head, and it was just incredible.  I want a picture of him worshipping, because it was so incredibly beautiful.  Then there's little Juanca, who was worshipping and then crying out to the Lord, desperate for Him, and just worshipping with his entire being.  Crystal Cornejo, wow, - I have never seen her focus on the Lord like she did last night.  She completely surrendered herself in front of her friends that always talk and distract others.  It was a little piece of God reaching out to her and then her responding.  Then there was Joanna and her new friends, Christine and Justine, and they were all worhipping the Lord joyously - I love when new people feel comfortable to just worship.  It's so encouraging.  These were just all the kids I saw worshipping, in front of the couches. . . Praise You Lord for the work You are doing in the youth and for the heart of worship that You are giving them.  Please Lord continue to do Your work.  I will hold on to Your promise in Philippians 1:6  "I will continue to complete the work in you until the day of Lord Jesus". (I think that's right) Please Lord, complete it in all of us.  :)I need to try this again.  One to see if the comic will show now, and two to see if I have comments.  Hmm. . .urlLink    Check out this comic that Jessica found for me.  It goes perfect with my past two hosts.     urlLinkRelationships based upon real/ superficial communication   1.There are some people that I only talk to mostly in person or on the phone.  2.There are others that I have only e-mailed and spoke to on the phone a few times.  3.Yet, there are other people that I used to hang out with all the time, but now due to new circumstances in life, it seems like we catch up via e-mail.  Someone has told me that they think if you mostly e-mail someone and have never seen them in person, than this would be considered a superficial relationship. When I asked if I talk to someone 70% of the time via e-mail and the other 30 % either on the phone or in person, that person continued to say that that would be a superficial relationship. Yet, that same person is the 3rd type mentioned above.  We used to only hang out and talk on the phone, but now our communication is based via e-mail.  So according to that person's logic, our relationship has moved from real to superficial, right?  Yet, there are some people that I know more about and have more of an honest relationship with, due to e-mail and our communication that way.  Yet, after a while, it gets drawn out and it doesn't last.  Is it just like every other relationship where it goes in spurts of varying amounts of communication?  I really don't know.    I do know that no matter if the relationship is superficial or real, according to each person's standards, God is able to use us.  We are able to be a light into that person's life and able to make a difference.  We can still show God's love and still be able to care about people.    Ben's comment off of my last blog makes a lot of sense (even though it's poetic).  A person's skin doesn't make the difference or make the relationship/ communication more or less real.  It doesn't change who we truly are and what we're all about.  What does matter is that no matter what type of communication we're using, the most important thing is honesty.  It is then that a true relationship is formed and can be trusted to be true.  People can always lie as to who they are, and that is when the relationship/ communcation becomes superficial.Classic quotes from kids during VBS....  Addi Hoover (5)- "My favorite part of VBS is when the teachers love on me." Eric Thomas (4)- "Jesus is going to be so mad at you." (as another child put a leigh around his neck and was pulling on it) Axton - (4 1/2)"People usually think I'm two until they hear me start talking." another quote from Axton - "One way in which Jesus saves us is like when Peter was walking on the water and then began to sink.  Jesus then picked him up and helped him.  That's one way in which Jesus saves us", Then I said, "Axton, can you please repeat that because some of the other kids were talking and they couldn't hear you."  He replied with, "They heard me.  Why?  What's the point."  Classic moments.....  Gabby - She just finished repeating the sinner's prayer...Right after she said Amen, she picked her nose.    I know that Noah and Jennah did some totally cute things too...As with Addi and others...Feel free to post other classic moments or quotes from our week of fun on Lava Lava Island....Please pray for my friend Jason.  Today makes the 1 year anniversary of when his brother committed suicide.  Neither he or his family are Christians, and so they are not leaning on God for their hope and comfort.  He did not come into work today and so I am not aware of how he is doing.  Thank you.  Lord, I just want to lift up Jason to You right now.  I ask You to comfort Jason, his parents, his sister-in-law, and his nephew.  May You comfort them that they may be able to feel Your presence.  May You give them Your strength and sufficiency that they may be able to handle this situation and the remebrance.  May You pour down Your love onto them that they may feel no void.  Lord, may You also soften their hearts that they may be able to know that You are real.  May You give them the gift of faith that will cause them to come to salvation.  Thank You Lord for Your goodness, Your grace and Your mercy, and I ask You Lord to pour onto this family Your grace, mercy, love, strength, comfort, and healing.  Thank you Jesus, I love You so much.To my earthly dad on Father's day....  As a baby, you nurtured me; As a child, you raised me; As a teen, you loved me; As an adult, you guide me.  Thank you for being my father and my friend.  To my HEAVENLY FATHER on FATHER'S DAY....  before my existance, YOU THOUGHT OF ME. before my entering of this world, YOU CREATED me WONDERFULLY AND PERFECTLY. as a baby, YOU COMFORTED me AND LOVED me UNCONDITIONALLY. as a child, YOU DISCIPLINED, TAUGHT, AND RAISED me. as a teen, YOU FORGAVE me, BELIEVED IN me, SAUGHT AFTER me, AND CHASED me WITH YOUR LOVE AND YOUR HOPE IN WHAT i may one day become. as a college student, YOU SHOWED me YOUR GRACE AND MERCY AND my need for You and emptiness without YOU. as an adult, YOU CONTINUE TO TEACH, GUIDE, BLESS, LOVE, CHANGE, MOLD, AND CREATE me INTO WHAT YOU DESIRE.  YOU SHOW me YOUR GRACE, MERCY, AND PATIENCE.  Thank You my true Father and Lord for being my Father, Friend, Husband, Lord, and King.  I will love You forever and try to praise You always, no matter what situation or trial comes my way.  I praise You Lord.  Amen.I have had a chance to spend some time with my little couisins lately, and they are just way too cute!  Kylie is turning 7 on the 4th of July and she just had her 'friends' birthday party yesterday.  Since she had a rock star party, she made up her own song.  She sung it to me Friday night, and let me just say watch out female pop stars, because here she comes!  :)  I Want to Be...  by Kylie Bowman  I want to be a girl I want to be a grown-up I want to go to the mall with my friends I want to be on American Idol I want to be a singer Oh Yeah!  Then, today Sydney (4) and Colten (5) were putting a puzzle together.  Sydney wanted to be the one that connected the pieces.  Even though Colten is the one that found the piece, he handed it to Sydney and let her put it in the puzzle.  I told him how nice he was being and how impressed I was that he was being so good.  Then, he replied with, "Yeah, I'm being really nice and good.  That way, I can get another cookie."  How can people not want to be around kids all the time?  They are just so dang cute!Isaiah 40:3-5 3 A voice of one calling: "In the desert prepare the way for the LORD; make straight in the wilderness a highway for our God.  4 Every valley shall be raised up, every mountain and hill made low; the rough ground shall become level, the rugged places a plain.  5 And the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all mankind together will see it. For the mouth of the LORD has spoken."  These are some of my favorite verses (and they are in my least favorite part of the book of Isaiah). I personally really like the first 20 chapters and the last 20 chapters more than the middle ones. . .Anywho, these verses are good to think about for a couple of reasons:  1.  They are good to think about with trials.  God is able to make our way out of every trial a smooth path.  He can make every hurdle in our lives seem easy, and He can change every part of the situation and circumstances.  2.  God is able to do this when witnessing.  Sometimes we can think that some people are unreachable.  I have thought this about people at work, but yet, I have had a chance to share little things with each of the "untouchable" people.  God can change their hearts and make way for little tidbits of light and His word and love to reach His people.  3.  God can do everything.  He can do the impossible.  We are His creation, just like the mountains, hills, rocks...  He can do amazing things with them and He can do amazing things with us.  Praise You Lord for You are good and worthy of ALL of our praise.Disclaimer:  If you are aware of one of my other blogs and I have not personally told you that you can look at that blog, please don't.  This is the one that I like to share with everyone and the others are more for accountability with girls and for myself...  There is nothing against anyone, I love you all regardless, but I would just prefer if only a select few people look at my other blogs.  Thanks!  :)I love you Jesus for all the things You have done in my life and all the things You are doing.So it has.Not By Sight?Here's something that really stopped me.   The First Elegy   Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the angels' hierarchies? and even if one of them pressed me suddenly against his heart: I would be consumed in that overwhelming existence. For beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, which we still are just able to endure, and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us. Every angel is terrifying.   And so I hold myself back and swallow the call-note of my dark sobbing. Ah, whom can we ever turn to in our need? Not angels, not humans, and already the knowing animals are aware that we are not really at home in our interpreted world. Perhaps there remains for us some tree on a hillside, which every day we can take into our vision; there remains for us yesterday's street and the loyalty of a habit so much at ease when it stayed with us that it moved in and never left.   Oh and night: there is night, when a wind full of infinite space gnaws at our faces. Whom would it not remain for--that longed-after, mildly disillusioning presence, which the solitary heart so painfully meets. Is it any less difficult for lovers? But they keep on using each other to hide their own fate.   Don't you know yet? Fling the emptiness out of your arms into the spaces we breathe; perhaps the birds will feel the expanded air with more passionate flying.  Yes--the springtimes needed you. Often a star was waiting for you to notice it. A wave rolled toward you out of the distant past, or as you walked under an open window, a violin yielded itself to your hearing. All this was mission. But could you accomplish it? Weren't you always distracted by expectation, as if every event announced a beloved? (Where can you find a place to keep her, with all the huge strange thoughts inside you going and coming and often staying all night.)  But when you feel longing, sing of women in love; for their famous passion is still not immortal. Sing of women abandoned and desolate (you envy them, almost) who could love so much more purely than those who were gratified. Begin again and again the never-attainable praising; remember: the hero lives on; even his downfall was merely a pretext for achieving his final birth. But Nature, spent and exhausted, takes lovers back into herself, as if there were not enough strength to create them a second time. Have you imagined Gaspara Stampa intensely enough so that any girl deserted by her beloved might be inspired by that fierce example of soaring, objectless love and might say to herself, "Perhaps I can be like her"? Shouldn't this most ancient of sufferings finally grow more fruitful for us? Isn't it time that we lovingly freed ourselves from the beloved and, quivering, endured: as the arrow endures the bowstring's tension, so that gathered in the snap of release it can be more than itself. For there is no place where we can remain.  Voices. Voices. Listen, my heart, as only saints have listened: until the gigantic call lifted them off the ground; yet they kept on, impossibly, kneeling and didn't notice at all: so complete was their listening. Not that you could endure  God's  voice--far from it. But listen to the voice of the wind and the ceaseless message that forms itself out of silence. It is murmuring toward you now from those who died young. Didn't their fate, whenever you stepped into a church in Naples or Rome, quietly come to address you? Or high up, some eulogy entrusted you with a mission, as, last year, on the plaque in Santa Maria Formosa. What they want of me is that I gently remove the appearance of injustice about their death--which at times slightly hinders their souls from proceeding onward.  Of course, it is strange to inhabit the earth no longer, to give up customs one barely had time to learn, not to see roses and other promising Things in terms of a human future; no longer to be what one was in infinitely anxious hands; to leave even one's own first name behind, forgetting it as easily as a child abandons a broken toy. Strange to no longer desire one's desires. Strange to see meanings that clung together once, floating away in every direction. And being dead is hard work and full of retrieval before one can gradually feel a trace of eternity.-- Though the living are wrong to believe in the too-sharp distinctions which they themselves have created. Angels (they say) don't know whether it is the living they are moving among, or the dead. The eternal torrent whirls all ages along in it, through both realms forever, and their voices are drowned out in its thunderous roar.  In the end, those who were carried off early no longer need us: they are weaned from earth's sorrows and joys, as gently as children outgrow the soft breasts of their mothers. But we, who do need such great mysteries, we for whom grief is so often the source of our spirit's growth--: could we exist without  them ? Is the legend meaningless that tells how, in the lament for Linus, the daring first notes of song pierced through the barren numbness; and then in the startled space which a youth as lovely as a god had suddenly left forever, the Void felt for the first time that harmony which now enraptures and comforts and helps us.   Rainer Maria Rilke trans. Stephen MitchellT. S. Eliot   S`io credesse che mia risposta fosse  A persona che mai tornasse al mondo,  Questa fiamma staria senza piu scosse.  Ma perciocche giammai di questo fondo  Non torno vivo alcun, s'i'odo il vero,  Senza tema d'infamia ti rispondo.    Let us go then, you and I,  When the evening is spread out against the sky  Like a patient etherized upon a table;  Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,  The muttering retreats  Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels  And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells  Streets that follow like a tedious argument  Of insidious intent  To lead you to an overwhelming question...  Oh, do not ask, "What is it?''  Let us go and make our visit.   In the room the women come and go  Talking of Michelangelo.   The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes  The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes  Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening.  Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains.  Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys.  Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,  And seeing that it was a soft October night,  Curled once about the house, and fell asleep.   And indeed there will be time  For the yellow smoke that slides along the street,  Rubbing its back upon the window-panes;  There will be time, there will be time  To prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet;  There will be time to murder and create,  And time for all the works and days of hands  That lift and drop a question on your plate;  Time for you and time for me.  And time yet for a hundred indecisions,  And for a hundred visions and revisions,  Before the taking of a toast and tea.   In the room the women come and go  Talking of Michelangelo.   And indeed there will be time  To wonder, "Do I dare?'' and, "Do I dare?''  Time to turn back and descend the stair,  With a bald spot in the middle of my hair--  [They will say: "How his hair is growing thin!'']  My morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,  My necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin--  [They will say: "But how his arms and legs are thin!'']  Do I dare  Disturb the universe?  In a minute there is time  For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse.   For I have known them all already, known them all:  Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,  I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;  I know the voices dying with a dying fall  Beneath the music from a farther room.          So how should I presume?   And I have known the eyes already, known them all--  The eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase,  And when I am formulated, sprawling on a pin,  When I am pinned and wriggling on the wall,  Then how should I begin  To spit out all the butt-ends of my days and ways?          And how should I presume?   And I have known the arms already, known them all--  Arms that are braceleted and white and bare  [But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair!]  Is it perfume from a dress  That makes me so digress?  Arms that lie along a table, or wrap about a shawl.          And should I then presume?          And how should I begin?                                .   .   .   .   .  Shall I say, I have gone at dusk through narrow streets  And watched the smoke that rises from the pipes  Of lonely men in shirt-sleeves, leaning out of windows? . . .   I should have been a pair of ragged claws  Scuttling across the floors of silent seas.                                .   .   .   .   .  And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!  Smoothed by long fingers,  Asleep. . . tired . . . or it malingers,  Stretched on the floor, here beside you and me.  Should I, after tea and cakes and ices,  Have the strength to force the moment to its crisis?  But though I have wept and fasted, wept and prayed,  Though I have seen my head [grown slightly bald] brought in upon a platter,  I am no prophet--and here's no great matter;  I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,  And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,  And in short, I was afraid.   And would it have been worth it, after all,  After the cups, the marmalade, the tea,  Among the porcelain, among some talk of you and me,  Woud it have been worth while,  To have bitten off the matter with a smile,  To have squeezed the universe into a ball  To roll it toward some overwhelming question,  To say: "I am Lazarus, come from the dead,  Come back to tell you all, I shall tell you all''--  If one, settling a pillow by her head,          Should say: "That is not what I meant at all.          That is not it, at all.''   And would it have been worth it, after all,  Would it have been worth while,  After the sunsets and the dooryards and the sprinkled streets,  After the novels, after the teacups, after the skirts that trail along the floor--  And this, and so much more?--  It is impossible to say just what I mean!  But as if a magic lantern threw the nerves in patterns on a screen:  Would it have been worth while  If one, settling a pillow, or throwing off a shawl,  And turning toward the window, should say:          "That is not it at all,          That is not what I meant, at all.''                                .   .   .   .   .  No! I am not Prince Hamlet, nor was meant to be;  Am an attendant lord, one that will do  To swell a progress, start a scene or two,  Advise the prince; no doubt, an easy tool,  Deferential, glad to be of use,  Politic, cautious, and meticulous;  Full of high sentence, but a bit obtuse;  At times, indeed, almost ridiculous--  Almost, at times, the Fool.   I grow old . . . I grow old . . .  I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled.   Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach?  I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach.  I have heard the mermaids singing, each to each.    I do not think that they will sing to me.   I have seen them riding seaward on the waves  Combing the white hair of the waves blown back  When the wind blows the water white and black.   We have lingered in the chambers of the sea  By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown  Till human voices wake us, and we drown.by Paul Celan  Black milk of daybreak we drink it at sundown  we drink it at noon in the morning we drink it at night  we drink it and we drink it  we dig a grave in the clouds there one lies unconfined  A man lives in the house he plays with the serpents he writes  he writes when dusk falls to Germany your golden hair Margarete  he writes it and steps out of doors and the stars are all flashing he whistles his dogs out  he whistles his Jews out in earth has them dig for a grave  he commands us strike up for the dance    Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night  we drink in the morning at noon we drink you at sundown  we drink you and we drink you  A man lives in the house he plays with the serpents he writes  he writes when dusk falls to Germany your golden hair Margarete  your ashen hair Shulamith we dig a grave in the skies there one lies unconfined    He calls out jab deeper into the earth you lot you others sing now and play  he grabs at the iron in his belt he waves it his eyes are blue  jab deeper you lot with your spades you others play on for the dance    Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night  we drink you at noon in the morning we drink you at sundown  we drink and we drink you  a man lives in the house your golden hair Margarete  your ashen hair Shulamith he plays with the serpents  He calls out more sweetly play death death is the master from Deutschland  he calls out more darkly now stroke your strings then as smoke you will rise into air  then a grave you will have in the clouds there one lies unconfined    Black milk of daybreak we drink you at night  we drink you at noon death is a master from Germany  we drink you at sundown and in the morning we drink and we drink you  death is a master from Deutschland his eyes are blue  he strikes you with leaden bullets his aim is true  a man lives in the house your golden hair Margarete  he sets his pack on to us he grants us a grave in the air  he plays with the serpents and daydreams death is a master from Germany  your golden hair Margarete  your ashen hair ShulamithSo, on this great day of BBQing, I was wondering if anyone had any good recipes for stuff to put on the grill.  I mean besides the normal hot dog or hamburger, of course.  Anyone do anything especially delicious out there?Excerpt from my Statement of Purpose for grad school....  I have been excited to see poetry increase its engagement of society through different vehicles such as performance poetry, Poetry in Motion, and Robert Pinsky’s Favorite Poem Project.  The poet’s job is not just to write poetry, but to bring poetry to the attention of society--not just for the sake of furthering poetry itself, but to bring attention to that which poetry addresses.  Whether the misfortunes of others or the enjoyment of the beautiful, poetry tells us we are not alone, there are more perspectives than our own, we are not always right, and we are not always wrong.  This engagement of society is especially important during present times, where we are bombarded by images of war and yet rushed through the hustle and bustle of life.  It is easy to go through life without really thinking.  It is the job of the poet, as all artists, to cause people to stop and think.Sorry everyone about the delay in my posts.  Off to a slow start.

I don't know how I would survive if it weren't for my goals of becoming a professor.  Getting into grad school, writing, and publishing has taken so much of my focus that it's really gotten me through many otherwise tediously boring days.  I'd be such a victim of the daily grind if I didn't have something tangible to strive for.   I realize that a lot of other people I know have church...and get engrossed in church because it gives a sense of meaning and fulfillment that their jobs just don't provide.  I try to imagine being in business or being a consultant...and it seems so drab and boring.  I hate the days when I'm busy doing tons of things and yet come out realizing that I didn't spend any time doing anything that I really cared about.  It's such a suffocating feeling...it's just slaving away, living for your next moment of freedom.   It's no wonder that so many people live for the weekends or live for fun.  I can see why people go out a lot and try to regain their sanity by drinking or clubbing.   I suppose I'm too selfish for that.   I hate it when I go out and try to do something for fun...and after it's over I feel like I've wasted my time.  Don't get me wrong, I think it's important to enjoy life.  And I enjoy having fun.  Often times fun things aren't a waste of time.  But I'm realizing, once again, that there are those times that you just feel like it was such a waste...and I really really hate that feeling.   It makes me glad that I have goals and a sense of purpose.   Does anyone else know what I'm talking about?Well...it's been a very long time since I last posted...and I'm rather surprised at how different blogger has become.  So now I'm torn...blogger or xanga?So I've come to a big point in my life.  I want to pick out a dental floss that's right for me.  Any suggestions?So, today while perusing  urlLink Slashdot , I came upon an interesting article discussing how  urlLink cellular phone convergence devices are a black hole, eating away at profits of other electronic gadgets . I don't know where these people are getting their info, but nobody's giving away these things with their cell plans. If you want a full-on converged device (Treo, iPAQ, etc), you're looking at spending a few hundred dollars. A few hundred dollars which, I might add, go mostly to the company that designed the phone. A perfect reason to buy stuff on the bleeding edge, instead of waiting for market saturation. Because, boys and girls, once these things saturate the market and become the "free" phones, there'll be even neater gadgets that still have to be purchased.  In other news, folks trying to decide whether to purchase a  urlLink Treo 600 or a T-Mobile Sidekick  now have a decent guide to aid in their decision. Personally, I had already made my decision, and I love my Treo. However, to folks who don't understand my love, it's a very well-done presentation made from a person as opposed to a commercial marketing standpoint.So, here it is. I have a blog. Impressed yet? I knew you would be.  Hi, um, I'm spazure. I have a PalmOne Treo 600 GSM phone and figured I'd create a blog to share my experiences with it, mostly because I'm sure others with the same phone might benefit from my trial (and sometimes error) of various features and programs.  Just to get an idea of the point of view, a little about me:  I'm 23 years old, and married. Don't confuse me with your typical housewife, though. I'm a poor college student.  My husband is a soldier in the U.S. Army :-)  I have friends all over the country, and I travel.... a lot.  Hm. That's about it for now, I guess. My first post is going to be a list of stuff currently on my Treo, as well as short little reviews on each piece of SW. Be looking out for it. :-)  -SpaziSo, the wonderful folks over at  urlLink MusicMatch  have recently released a new version, 9.0. No, I didn't learn this by going to their website, I learned it by running the installer I downloaded last year when I  purchased  MusicMatch 8, and realized it wasn't the actual setup file. No, the file you download from their website isn't the install file for ANY version of MusicMatch. It's an installer (that explains the fast download).  When you run the installer, it connects to MusicMatch's server and fetches the most current version of MusicMatch that's compatible with your system and the language you specify, installing it from their server. That's the problem. The actual setup executable is never on your hard drive. It wasn't always like this, I know I had the  real  setup files for MusicMatch 7. But not 8, and not 9.  So, if you want to download MusicMatch and install it on a machine that's not connected to the internet, or maybe you just want to downgrade to a different version, or a different language, all is not lost.  Apparently, MusicMatch keeps older versions of MusicMatch on  urlLink a publicly accessible web server . This isn't a page designed to ever be seen by customers, so it's not particularly intuitive, and I wouldn't suggest complaining to them about the user interface. Basically, the setup file naming convention is like this:  mmsetup_#.##.####_XXX.exe  To find the version/language you need, look to the first # in the series. That's the version number. All the rest are revision numbers. You'll probably want the most recent revision, as it's got all the bug fixes, but whatever, it's up to you. The last three letters are the language. I don't know them all, but here's a short list of the ones I *do* know:  ENU - English ESP - Spanish FRA - French KOR - Korean DEU - German CHS - Chinese  I'm also not sure about the releases marked "DELL" or "Apple". I have a Dell PC. I'll look into that. As for the apple, well, no clue. I own no apple machines, but from what I recall of the last one I did have, they don't run windows executables well.   Note:  These are all just the shareware versions. If you have purchased a version of MusicMatch, you'll still need to enter your product key to unlock the Pro features.sushi treats for your pets!

Everyone put so much work into making everything run smoothly and well. Especially Dane and Greg and Lisa's parents who really helped to put everything together and make sure that everything ran so smoothly. Even with the groom to be and his family managing to get completely lost and arrive 2 hours late... (though if anyone needs a good shortcut to New Millford, I can provide) Thank you to everyone for coming and for all your congratulations and thoughtful gifts.Something weird going on with the archive. Going to try and fix it soon.Anyone who needs directions to my engagement party, give me a call on my cell phone. The party's Saturday Dec. 28th @ 6PM.Merry Christmas to everyone! BBQ grilled turkey and stuffing are definitely the way to go for dinner. Korean food isn't bad as an appetizer, but it's nice to have a sitdown family meal followed by a boardgame.Finally done with Finals for the semester. What a great feeling. Now I'm just looking forward to some Christmas and getting into the engagement party on the 28th. Happy holidays for everyone.Last night was pretty crazy. The basic timeline: Miss the first train. Rush through dinner. Arrive at STOMP only to find out that apparently there's a time restriction on our tickets where you have to show up 1/2 hour early (not what I was told over the phone when I made the reservation) Decide to see Lord of the Rings:Two Towers instead. They're sold out for an hour. Wait in a bar until just before the movie only to find out OUR tickets are for the OTHER Loews theatre 2 blocks away (despite saying we didn't want that show) Rushing to that theatre. The movie was great, but by the time we get out, we rush to the Port Authority only to find out that their subway stop is closed late at night, causing us to miss the last train back to Jersey and wait in Penn Station for 3 hours... All in all, quite an odd night.Only 1 exam left to go next week, then nothing more for a while. It's such a liberating feeling to be free from that time immediate pressure feeling. I'm going to see STOMP tomorrow night, with some tickets I got through work. Should be interesting, and I'm excited since I've heard a lot of good things about the show. Ben Stein wrote an editorial about  urlLink How to Ruin American Enterprise  where he rants on about the decline of the American work ethic and willingness to take responsibility for our actions. I quite agree.This whole blogging thing is rather addictive, I must admit. I've had all these great ideas for things that I could do to my site now, to make it more interesting, and also things that wouldn't (hopefully) need more work from me. :) It should be interesting seing in a few weeks or so, how things end up progressing, and what we end up with. I was just thinking that I'll probably end up setting up a similar site for ROTC or something along those lines.I just inserted sections on films and books that I've read or viewed recently. I will most likely be updating those sections rather infrequently, but there are so many good books and other works out there, that I just had to plug a few that have caught my eye.I'm starting to add some other interesting items, in addition to the newslinks I have a photo album, guestbook, and some other items in the offering. Hopefully over the next few days I'll manage to put things together.I'm engaged to the most wonderful person in the world. Lisa Ann Colon. :)I'm just about getting ready to go to my CS323 exam. I'll post later with how everything went.I've added headlines from the  urlLink Daily Targum  where I work to give you an idea of some of the events that are occuring in the Rutgers area.I'm in the middle of final exams at  urlLink Rutgers  right now. I have 1 tonite from 8PM until 11PM, and another tomorrow at noon, so I don't expect to really be able to get into working on this site until later on, maybe after the holidays. I'm hopping that using a weblog style backend will mean that I update it more than once a month or so.This is the new recently revised version of my personal site. While things are being worked around, if you're intersted in my resume, it's still available at:  urlLink http://www.shao.org/jay/resume.html . More content will be following shortly.Made it by the skin of my teeth on my run today. And damn, it was cold!!!  urlLink weather.com  said it was warmer than it was on Friday morning, but it really didn't feel like it. Rounding the bend in Buccleauch Park, right after the apartments I could feel the wind blasting into my face and it felt like my whole body was frozen through. I think I'll do really well in Push-ups and situps tomorrow on the diagnostic, however, as I almost floated through those events (admittedly I was only doing the 60 percent minimum) All in all I'm feeling pretty good about the performance, though I have to admit that it was one of the hardest things that I've ever done/managed to accomplish.APFT Monday that I have to pass. I'm about 24 seconds away on the run, so hopefully I'll be able to post here on Monday that I had an outstanding run time.Been doing PT again now that the winter break is wrapping to a close, and it's really been wiping me out. Also, I've gotten a couple copies of the email form letter about Jane Fonda and Vietnam vets on the web recently. If you see it take it with a grain of salt. Many of the examples are fictionalized.Snow this week has been unbelievable. My car was streetside parked, and it took me and Lisa almost 40 minutes to dig it out. (The first 5 minutes were actually pretty fun, just like playing in the snow as a little kid. 15 minutes later, when the snow plow came by and plowed me back in... was less fun.) Classes are still out, though they should be starting again soon.  Snow also postponed the other big task I've been working on, which is interviewing candidates for the Targum Marketing Director for next year. Oh well. I guess there's not much you can do when your carefully laid plans are upset by the textbook definition of an "act of God."Still working on fixing the archives. Hopefully they'll be up soon.RUSH is next week. Anyone who is interested in Fraternities at Rutgers should come check out  urlLink SigEp .Something that amazes me is the emphasis the media gives Anti-war rallies due to their numbers. 100,000 people is a significant amount, mind you, however I note that organizations like Louis Farakhan, or Promisekeepers, or NOW can rally larger numbers in peacetime without gathering equivalent attention. Although 100,000 individuals is a non-insignificant number, in this modern age of suberbia and mass-transit into urban centers, is it really as impressive a number as it would have been even 20 years ago? NYC draws not just on the population of the city itself, but that of surrounding areas in NJ, Long Island, etc.  I think part of the reason for the percieved liberal slant of the media is media's emphasis on covering "what's happening now" which has been translated into changes. Despite the fact that the status quo is an equally important part of the total picture, there's a wide bias that if it's not new, it's not news.Lets hear it for nice weather. Such a relief compared to the last few weeks of snow, storms, and everything else. It seems like a good way to end Spring Break.I've posted the slides from the ROTC class on financial management online here:  urlLink financialmanagement.PPT  for anyone who missed the class and who wanted to read up on the material.I'm not going to be able to make it to the  urlLink CNBAM  conference in Miami next week. :( Unfortunately, I had some Army training which I won't be able to miss. I trust our 2003-2004 Business Manager and Marketing Director will hold us in good stead as far as representing the Targum goes, though.  Good luck on all the awards, and make sure you bring back somethign for us stuck in NJ types.Event:	Raw:	Score: PU	67	96 SU	76	97 RU	15:42	63  Total Score:	256  That's pretty much my personal all time high, so I'm pretty psyched about it. I'm a little disappointed that all the time spent running over the past couple of weeks hasn't translated into a greater improvement in my run time, though.I sit in a cubicle that is ten feet wide by eight feet deep.  That's really big for one person.  The problem is, I'm not alone in here anymore.  There's my new friend, I'll call him "C" to protect his identity.  I have a feeling he is one of those guys who will go all out to make things work for this place.  His life is 80% job, 20% home.  I pity him, I do.  But it is not my place here to push people away from the corporation, just annoy them by questioning stupid things they do.  Like dress codes and logins for internet use and hour lunches and managers-for-managers-for-managers.  It's my place to say, "Why do I get dressed up to work here everyday?  I sit hidden from the world...who cares if I wear dress shoes?  The lengths people go through to control other people.  Anyway, so now I'm stuffed in a cubicle with a guy I don't know, and I certainly don't and won't understand his world, and we crash our chairs together everytime one of us stands up to leave.  We'll see how long this lasts.  They won't listen to me, I'm a borrowed grunt.  But "C" is one of them, he'll be heard.  If this place wants a war...they're messing with the wrong man.I was standing in the train station this afternoon waiting to board the train home.  It was hot in the station and I was bundled in winter coat and scarf so I was already feeling odd.  Suddenly I felt dizzy, I felt my body rock back on to my heels and a surge of heat consumed me inside my coat.  Everything felt fake, people were two dimensional and I felt invisible.  I ran an internal systems check on myself to see if I could figure out what was wrong.  No sniffles, no body aches, no head aches...uh oh.  Stomach.  I was starving, ravenous is a better word for it.  With three dollars to my name, I couldn't even by a crappy burger from McDonald's.  Starvation.  I climbed on the train figuring I would last another hour, boy was I wrong.  The first thing I noticed was my hands, I was trying to read and they were shaking real bad, it's creepy.  Eventually I couldn't read because my stomach was just screaming at my dumb ass.  For the last two months since school started, my body has taken a beating.  I lost ten pounds that I couldn't afford to lose in the first week of school alone, and I'm not sure what I weigh now but it can't be good.  I need to eat, I know this, but I don't have time.  I guess that's a bad excuse though.  At least I'm not avoiding eating and hiding food in walls like a Lifetime Tracy Gold special...Since August I have had this song rattling around in my head.  I heard the song on CD94.7, the classic rock station in the Chicago area.  I don't know the name, I don't know the band that sings it, I don't even know any lyrics.  I do know the tune and how the piano in it goes.  That's all.  So I made the active decision to listen to CD94.7 religiously until I heard that song and my quest would be completed with a quick dip into the Napster libraries.  Well, last night something odd happened.  CD94.7 was playing some 80's tunes, and I thought, "okay, they play blocks of some late 60's stuff, why not some 80's?"  So today, I turn on 94.7 in my car and I'm horrified.  They're still playing 80's tunes.  I visit what WAS the CD94.7 homepage which is now the 94.7 THE ZONE homepage.  I was suddenly numb.  The one channel I knew for sure would eventually save me from this musical hell, was now gone.  We already have an 80's station!  Now we have NO classic rock, or not that I know of!  ARG!  The music gods have scorned me.One last message before I run...  COMING SOON -  urlLink Jeff Eichhorn , THE BLOG  That's going to be H O T.Today is the day we recognize the ultimate sacrifice that our Sons of Liberty have paid. From the greens of Lexington to the streets of Falujah, our citizen soldiers continue to lay down their lives for our liberty.  Freedom is never free, it can only be paid by willing blood. It must be purchased daily, and we miss a payment at the peril of our destruction.  The Navy has a habit of naming ships after battles so we never forget. Here is but a sample:  Lexington, Antiham, Belleau Wood. Iwo Jima, Chosin, Hue City. Coral Sea, Lake Erie, Vella Gulf. Vincennes, Bunker Hill, Normandy. Chancellorsville, Anzio, Yorktown.  If your American History did not cover these battles, please Google them to find out about these battles so that these men and women can continue to live on in our memories.  As I write this, tears stream down my cheeks for those who didn't come home. An unabashed love for my brother and sister soldiers, sailors and Marines, I am not ashamed to admit to these tears. I shed these tokens of love for those who went before and after me because nothing else I could give would have as much meaning.  As you place flags on the graves of these fallen heroes, remember that there is no gravestone for those who died at sea, for that is where they are buried.  Let us never forget their sacrifice, their blood spilt so that, "...the government of the people, by the people and for the people shall not perish from the earth."Oh, look at the time - perhaps the pub's open...[ This is hey, v4.4 ]

If I could have 7 - 9 hours of guaranteed sleep everyday, I am fairly certain that I would be more productive.  After all, how many people who stay up all hours are actualy productive those night hours?  And to those who go to bed at 3 or 4 am,  what are you doing during those worthless hours?  Compare the person who gets up at 8am to the one who gets up 1pm.  You get about 100% more things done when you are up in the morning.  IMHO.A blog. What is a blog? Bitesize liver organ gestation? Clearly a ploy of human eating aliens. It is obvious what they want. The question is do you want to give it to them? I say yes. Although it will ultimately lead to all of our deaths, it is what they will least expect. That has to count for something.I try to think of Reloaded and Revolutions as one movie because that is what it is.  It is quite obvious that the movie was simply cut in half because they couldn't fit it into one long 3 hour movie.  First, I believe I can say that the first movie will always be my favorite.  It was the original, it was never thought of before, it was and still is incredible.  The 2nd and 3rd movies were also incredible.  We see more characters, more developments in an already captivating plot, better special effects and better action.  While I know there is a lot to understand about choice and cause and effect, I think from my first viewing of the conclusion it was made apparent to me that the machines were not just machines that have gone insane.  They were intelligent and alive and some were tired of the war and wanted it to end as the humans did.  The machines made a deal with Neo to end the war if he saved them from Smith and they kept their part of the agreement.  In addition, the argument of predicting or reasoning with pure logic or in contrast the emotion of love also was a great base plot element.  Also, a good point was made by one of my viewing friends that this movie did not have a 'Hollywood' ending.  Not everyone made it, characters we liked were killed.  To me, it makes it even more authentic and true to Wachowski bros. legacy.  It will be hard, but I hope these guys can continue to amaze us with future films.Well, finally it is here.  The Matrix Revolutions, the conclusion to the best sci-fi trilogy since Star Wars.  Best Sci-fi anything since who knows what.  I know that some people are watching it right now.  I almost took off work, but decided to see it with the rest of my friends in The Foamrat Collective.  Amazingly, I am a little worried.  I think I have hyped up this movie for myself more than any movie ever.  I know that it will likely live up to the hype, as Reloaded did.  The greatest thing about this third movie is the fact that I simply have no idea how it is going to conclude.  I can't believe I've had to wait 6 months!"This is my new BLOGGER.

GO BOSTON!Hey!hey! i'm posting this from my car, while driving! technology rules.i'm off.  never made it to sleep though. took 4 hours to get my shocks and struts installed! oh well...i operate better on a little missed sleep...usually.  if i don't post again later tonight then i probably didn't make it.as i was relating to my seattle friend via msn messenger: i need to go and install my new shocks tonight, do all my laundry, pack incl. the computer i'm giving my fam, pick up gifts for my sister from my aunt's house, go out for beers, and get enough sleep to drive 14 hours straight tomorrow.  possible? sure is, i'm superman.does  urlLink  this  piss you off too?  defending the nation is one thing...this goes too far.why do all the girls i like have 'boy' baggage? seattle friend, 'boy' baggage. new friend, 'boy' baggage. friend from the summer, 'boy' baggage. arrgh!  on an upbeat note, looks like my new suspension is being delievered today so if i can get it installed this afternoon my drive up north will be super smooth!my new friend seems to be having a problem with bf or is it ex-bf? i im'd her and she said, "hold on - i'm being yelled at". now that's a bit sucky. looks like she's going over the his house now to pick up her stuff. i don't think he's home though, in denver maybe? i'm trying not to pry.  i did some xmas gift delivery tonight. only meant to stop real quick and drop off the gifts but ended up talking for awhile. it was very nice, don't seem them very often anymore. was falling asleep in the car on the way home. how can i still be tired?i think i'm finished with my shopping. didn't take me too long. i made a list, checked it twice. now i only have to wrap them.i am so stuffed right now.  my seattle friend ended up getting christmas eve and christmas day off and is now able to fly back home for xmas. good for her! i didn't get to spend xmas with my family one year due to work and it sucked. i'll miss out on seeing her but i don't think she's changed since halloween.  i've compiled my list of things to buy this afternoon. should be in and out the the stores quite quickly. then i have to wrap them.  my new friend made it to the lunch gtg (previously not able due to being surgeries all day), her boss brought her (in his lotus, he's the doctor). chicks in scrubs. ooo baby.ok, so i'm going to whine about work for a second. i just had a short meeting with my boss, who hails from iowa, about perceived start and end times of my work day. i'm a computer engineer and spend my day doing development and testing. as such, my work schedule is, how'd you say, variable. meaning i get into and leave work whenever i damn well please. when i was initally hired i asked about such things and what was expected of me. i was told that as long as the work gets done, the deadlines are met and the result is pleasent then he doesn't care. well my office is situated near one of the operations groups i engineer for. they see when i get in and when i leave, day in day out. apparently a couple of their managers have complained to my boss about my attendance and have asked what my schedule is. this 'couple' of people are cronic complainers and my manager knows it. i'm just sick and tired of having to defend myself to others that have no reason to be concerned with my buisness. boss says that its mainly his fault for not communicating enough to them and agrees that i am doing what needs to be done.  now that i read through that again, it doesn't sound much like a complaint. poo.  almost time for the noon lunch thing gtg us vw guys do on thursday. today its manuel's since people have gotten tired of pizza. i'm looking forward to it.ok, this goes against my adamantly stated music taste,  no country , but yet another dixie chicks song has won me over. first it was  urlLink goodbye earl , how can you not like that song? now its their remake of  urlLink landslide . i've been a  urlLink fleetwood mac  fan since i was little (thanks mom) now hearing it sung by natalie maines how can i not like it?i'm up. actually, i've been up since 11:30-ish but have been trying to convience myself otherwise. ended up sleeping when i got home from work, guess i'll be doing shopping after work today.  went and washed my car just a few minutes ago (that's just what some people do this early in the morning!). went to a spray off type place so I had to jump on the deserted freeway for a '120 mph blow dry' :)  used my heated mirrors for the first time to keep them from fogging. they're going to kick ass when i drive to boise. oh yea, i'm driving to boise for christmas to spend it with the fam. definately looking forward to it. my best friend in seattle is stuck there for the holiday's this year so i've invited her to spend xmas day with my family. mapquest says its 505 miles between the two cities. i think i've done the drive in 5 hours. makes me wonder if my friend will need to stay overnight so she doesn't end up on the road for 10 hours in one day. i offered to come get her, still thinking about how that will work. i'd really like to see her and am looking forward to it.  i parked my car in an empty covered spot tonight. i haven't seen anyone park in it since i moved in here, though i wasn't really paying much attention since i have my own garage. but now that my 65 mustang is parked in it (its not running and management will tow any disabled vehicles park outside) my poor  urlLink baby  has to park outside. i'm hungry.bypassed water. orange gatorade is where its at. called the boss, told him i was sick and was only going to be in the office until lunch after which i was going home. i'm forcing myself to stay until then, but not because i'm dedicated to my job or anything like that. the helpdesk that exists outside my office is ordering in olive garden and they extended an invite to me. can't pass up on that! now, should i use the afternoon to sleep as intended or should i use it to finish my xmas shopping?here i am at work, suffering.  this better be then end of my partying for the week.  my body is shutting down.  i hit 72 hours of not sleeping and i'm losing the ability to stay vertical.  my contacts wouldn't stay in this morning. swollen puffy red eyes.  on a good note, the party was a blast.  seemed like people had a good time and my place is totally cleanable.  was not thrashed like i expected.  of course i have to give credit to my jello shot making friend as she seemed to keep the kitchen clean most of the night.  that brings me to another thought, my new friend. the last 2 weeks have been the biggest partying weeks for me this year.  i met her during this time.  i'm thinking that i may be creating the wrong image of me in her mind, though she has partied just as hard over the same length of time so i don't know if its an issue after all.  except when i calm down again for a bit and then maybe she'll see me as boring.  i need water.omg...could i have anymore alcohol in my system?!  check the time, we have already eliminated the jello shots and i have done a yard of guiness plus 8 regular guiness from the can.  fucked up em i.  lets see if i remember taking this break to type this tomorrow.just checked the forums, looks like i have quite the mix of rsvps for tonight...things are looking up.  one of the new ppl i've been hanging out with is bring a 'batch' of jello shots. here is the im i got from her:  Official count - 62 shots, 7 flavors, 1.75L of Vodka . can you say ouch? between my guiness and these i should be legally dead by 8p. i'm hoping to get some good pictures tonight, dunno if they will make it into this blog. i'm still a bit wary of posting identifing info up here.  laundry is done drying.i didn't think i'd post again until tomorrow, but i have this wierd urge to write.  i left work about an hour ago so i could come home and do some quick cleaning. i'm feeling my 3rd wind coming so that's good. everytime i put something together i always get a bit nervous - will people show? will my neighbors get me evicted? am I going to make it into work tomorrow?  that foo fighters song is on the radio right now,  urlLink all my life .  man, something about this song, it rules.ok, so here it is. my first blog, the result of peer pressure and the need to belong to the in crowd. i have tons to say, especially after the week i've had, but since its only half way over i think i'm going to wait a bit. i'm throwing a party tonight so i should have some juicy bits tomorrow. oh, btw, i'm going on 48 hours without sleep. gotta love insomnia. cheers.went out with mom and the dog.  hit the park and then a downtown coffee shop.  snapped some pictures, a pretty pleasent time. day is almost over and so is my stay here in boise. probably won't snow until i leave...stupid weather!observation - i've talked more to my new friend this week then anyone else.  why is that?did some shopping today...buck fifty down at eddie bauer, but i got some nice stuff.  i only seem to shop when i'm on vacation...weird.the day is about over...went by pretty good. i got my serengeti sunglasses...very nice.  saw the bond movie...very nice.  ate some pumpkin pie...very nice.  good day.its christmas eve day. fam is just now getting around to decorating the tree. procrastination runs in this family. tonight is mandatory church night, like going just once a year means anything. i guess i can catalog my sock drawer in my head...day 2 with the fam is coming to an end. man am i beat and i haven't really done anything.  i did see lord of the rings - two towers today with dad.  good flick, hard to stay put for 3 hours but i will probably see it again while its in the theater.  my sinuses are acting up, head is very stuffy.well i made it. snowing here, i love it. fam is in good spirts. pillows on the bed suck, gonna get that fixed tonight. my car is a dirty bitch.**previously i had some whiny stuff here but have since come to my senses and removed it**  on another note, i'm off to a vw gathering and some diner followed by some drinking and passing out.  have a great night!day after...feeling fine.  need a shower though.  looks like tonight we are doing shots.  i hate my liver. ;)had another party at my place tonight.  pretty mellow, though my friend is pretty drunk.  but that's the point, right?  more so it means i get to spend more time with her since she can't drive home.  my neighbor upstairs came over too, so that's good that we've finally met.  i should get back out there, have a good evening!blah blah blah friday.  blah blah blah nothing to do. blah.i know its not really that late, but i'm dreading going back to work on monday because i have been staying up so late these past couple weeks and i don't know if i'm going to be back on a 'normal' sleep schedule come sunday night.  woe is me.so i totally didn't realize tonight was thursday night.  i missed scrubs but i did catch the new episode of good morning miami!  hopefully the other shows were all reruns.  damn vacation/holiday's screw up your week!i'm home again.  i smell like gasoline, grease, and cigarette smoke.  i guess that happens when you spend a few hours in a car shop.  but we were just talking!  looks like i will be taking my car in monday night for the install and should have it back by wednesday night.  one of my buddies has offered to loan me his car for those couple days.  that's damn nice of him.  i'm getting all excited!my heat broke last night.  i had to go out and get firewood to keep from getting frost bite. ;)  maintence guy let himself in at 8:30 this morning much to my surprise as i was sleeping.  nothing like the rush of hearing a stranger's voice in your own house when you know there shouldn't be anyone there with you.  heats back on now.  i went and did a quick consulting job today.  easy money for 3 hours work.  i also met up with my vw friends for lunch at tgi friday's.  now i'm waiting to drive out to that shop i was talking about the other day cuz my turbo kit is in!! yay!i just upgraded to blog*spot plus25....jealous? :p  with that, what do you think of the new graphic?i just had a nice brunch/lunch thing at a friend of my friend's house.  good ppl, good food.  its nice to just relax sometimes.it was a sexy day...   sorry, had to post that.  was watching sex in the city last night (earlier morning) with my friend and that line was used as the opener to a journal.  who does that?  so new years came and went without much excitement.  i volunteered to be the dd so i kept it at 2 guinesses for the night.  the other 5 ppl in my car got pretty drunk and had a very good time.  everyone got home safe and that's what really matters.  of course i would have had liked a kiss at midnight from someone, oh well.  found out that my upstairs neighbor is friends with my friend via school.  maybe she'll come down and party with me now?ok, the night is starting.  first out to dinner and then on to some parties.  dateless and with couples no less.  oh well - what can i do?confessions via email of feelings and thoughts...are they really that moving?  easy to put together and send, yes...but do they get the point across like saying them in person or even writing a actual, physical letter?  probably not, but its too hard to tell how or if someone can take emotional honesty in the face and creating physical evidence that your soul exists only tends to come back and haunt you.  fuck ppl, just read my goddamn mind!i have a problem.  this is a car related problem so for those not interested, look away for a bit.  i bought a turbo upgrade kit for my car and it should be here any day now.  my problem is finding someone or a shop to help with the install and not charge me an arm and a leg.  i had some friends offer in the begining, but now they are backing out.  i have a line on a shop but they are just a bit pricey though they'd get the job done right and probably fairly quickly.  now i also have a couple ppl that would help, for a price yet to be known, and they are knowledgable about my car.  i just have never seen them work nor do i know how long it would take them.  i'm thinking that it is probably worth the money compared to time and stress to go with the shop, after all the shop builds race cars!  i'm just having a hard time spending that kind of cash on something that could be done in a garage, especially when i have other things i need to buy like a new bed and new tires.  what a mindless rant.well i just had a nice meal at carrabba's with my neighbor.  she took her little girl with us, man that kid is noisy...cute though.  now its off to the coffee plantation to meet up with my vw crew.  the excitement abounds.i'm in a suedo good mood at the moment. the kind of mood you're in after you take a shower and put on new clothes for the first time and have a general feeling about yourself that you could take on the world. you dig?I made a Dr. Appointment for me on the 31st @ 130 to check a spot on my hand.   I pray it is nothing!!!   Its kinda scary,  Ken says he thinks it cancerous.  BUT ya know..i have learned one thing in life...I will always be ok... so I say its not going to be anything..(positive thinking) ...but I hope they take it off..cause i hate the way it looks.  :-)    Just dyed my hair again..I love it this time... Cant wait for hair to grow longer........   I want some excerise equipment... wanna keep my self in shape. GEE  this is all about me...  I dont normally do that....   But now that I am on that subject...i have been pondering lately.... I listen to the people here at work talk.... men as well as women... and everything they say is "ME ME ME"  and when I ask well what does your wife think or what about your husband...i get this look like I am nuts... one person even responded....  who cares..what he thinks... Maybe it is just me...but I always try to think about what the other person wants/needs/or how they feel.   am I wrong for thinking this??  I think not!  but maybe so.... like I said...just pondering............UUGGHH this is saturday and I am at work.,  I have alot of thinking to do...not that I dont feel as if I am always thinking.Ken's job is going so wonderful.  I know one day he is going to make it big.  I am so proud of him.  He came home yesterday and was telling us that a company that didnt even return a call on his resume, he will be teaching their whole IT security department... :-)  can you see my proudness showing through???????????  I keep telling him he is so smart.  One day he will realize it.  He is even going to have to go to California for SANS training.   My heart just swells for him.  Our kids are doing wonderful.  Kimberly broke my heart. She brought a test to me and Ken and she said.  I know I am not doing well....I need some help.  My heart broke into a million peice.  Bless kens heart.  He is going to get her to read to him every night.  Have I said how lucky I am lately?????????  I am extremely lucky.  Thought lately I feel as if he is so distant from me.  I dont want that to happen.  I truely love him.  I feel that I never knew what love was til now. I hope I dont screw it up...  well gotta go.I am at work.  I cant wait for the day that I get to say  "SEE YA"  and go to work for my husband.  (he is such a golden god..but shhhhhhhh  I didnt say that)Here I am sitting here wanting to be held But no one is here I am alone again Tears streaming down my face I am so mad or maybe its that I am so hurt I was told something today that I knew deep down but I guess I didnt want to hear it But none the less it had to be said I am a female  wanting to work in a mans world  Doing what I want to do the most I was 16 when I realized what I wanted to do with my life and now look at me...what do  I do I talk to users I dont do any of the things I wanted I have got to get back on track You know what I am going to do  I am going to show all who doubt me what I can really do I will show you  One and all I will show the ex who told me I would be nothing in life I will show the employeer who says a female will never get anywhere in this field I will show the employeer want to be that I am not just a salesman,  I am an engineer and I will show anyone else who doubts me I will show my husband that he has someone to be proud of  I will not ride on his wings to get my glory but I will stand alone do it my self with out help  and in the end  Stand up with sholders back in a proud stance and say see....I knew I could do it. You all should of been proud of me and not mocked me. and stand next to my husband the one I love and adore,  and tell him thank you for standing beside me and making me realize what I didnt want to see and pray that he will be proud of me as well.Sometimes I think I love way too much...does that make sense???  I love Ken so much and I am afraid to show him how much..I guess I am afraid that I will get hurt.  We are looking into getting him a new vehicle.  I was wanting one myself.  But I have changed my mind.  I dont really care what people think ya know.  Screw them is my attitude.  If you dont like my mercedes....then stick it up your rear.   I really want to loose weight but I find it impossible not to eat at least something.  So I am going to try to eat a little at lunch time...and then that be my last meal.  I think I can do that.  I want to stay sexy for my baby....  See how my mind goes...I keep thinking and thinking....I want to clear my head.......well gotta go..am going to go help my mother n law move.Baby, this message if for you............  There are times when I get real quite....  It is not that anything is wrong...But I tend to worry more than anyone knows... and there maybe times that I need to express it, but dont want to bother you with it.   This is a good way for me to ponder, I can write it down...come back to it when I am in a better frame of mind.  I just want you to know...if you ever worry or wonder whats going through my mind..just come here and look K....ok..cause I do love you with all my heart and soul.....I am so  Happy that I have you and our bri bri in my life.  I couldnt imagine life with out the both of you.  I love you BABY!!well...I have a day of thinking.....the kids thrilled me (well 2 of them) by asking me to ask their dad to let them live with me.  I dont know why I am like them, I am scared to death of them, see their is one thing I know about him.,...it is that he usually gets what he wants..and I am so afraid that he will do something to make me loose the kids forever...and that is what my kimberly is scared of Work..i got to thinking about that today too....I had to sign something stating that I agree that they charge me 10 dollars in taxes every month..ya know its not the 10 dollars...but its the fact that they say I have to carry the cell phone...and that I have to be on call, and that I have to work that SAT....or answer the call at 2 am...then they are going to charge me for that ummmm luxery..then say you cant use the phone for personal use??  i have never used if for personal use and never will..but GEEEEEEEE I wasnt going to use this for bitching...but both have made me so upset that my teeth hurt from gritting....and I dont want to bother my ken about it....   well such is life.....I am just glad that I have my family...ken and all   4 kids..... i love them with all my heart......LOVE>.....................I feel so loved!!!  I love it when I feel this way.    I have really been down on me lately...but tonight I have had a chance to rest and think.....  Yes ,... I have gained some weight... I can get it off ...... I know I can....  and you know what else ................... I can run a network too ... I will be given a chance... and I will prove it to everyone.  I also...will prove to TERRY SR>  that I am not scared of his ass no more and I will get  my kids.  and Ken and I will have a wonderful family with our 4 kids.  I even understand why he doesnt want a 5th.  I am not upset with that any more either.  I Love my Ken with all my heart.  I will always want one of his children.  BUT... I know 5 is alot.   I will always love ken.  We always tease around about how much we love each other.  But let me tell you, the way he makes love to me, the way he makes me feel, no matter what I look like whether its a day that I feel like crap or a day I feel sexier than ever..he always tells me I am beautiful.  I know GOD meant for me to meet him.. and to love him... he knew exactly what each of us needed. .... BABY if you read this....I LOVE YOUI feel like shit again!!  I totally hate the job I am at.   I know  more that most of the people on the level above me.  Today one of the Engineers made a comment to the people at the bank we are working on that I am level one.Making me feel about an inch high.  I could of cried.   I really feel lately that I am not wanted...not needed...and stupid.  Cause if I was smart. People would want to hire me. I feel totally worthless when it comes to my carreer.  And why in the hell am I so scared of standing up to the kids real father????  I guess I know what he is capable of...and that really scares the hell out of me.  He could convince a nun that she had sinned...ya know what I mean???  He is good....so I dont know how to handle him.  Thank god Ken and all 4 kids love me....  I am not bitching...I am just getting things off my mind so I dont dwell on it.Oh my God!!!!!  Kimberly about Ripped my heart out.....not her fault....but Whenshe comes to me crying like she did or afraid to talk.....I break down... I cant stand it.   She wants to live with me so bad.  She says her daddy threw away her diary because she wrote in it that she wants to live with me.  He threw away both of her diaries...What kind of a dad would do that??  I know...a dad that never wanted you in the first place... He is such a sorry dad.....  now look at me... i have 3 children by a man who never wanted them....and I will never have children by a man who wanted  the child he had...(his ex will never know how lucky she was).   Why cant all dads want the children they create??  But its fine with me he doesnt want them..but he uses them as pawns to hurt me....GOSHHH  WHAT AN ASS I was married tooo...Today..I got to do some things I love.  I got to help plan an Active Directory.  That was my favorite subject in my MIcrosoft Training.  I got to install servers I even didnt mind helping the kids set up the trianing rooms.  Yes the kids did it and did it with out fussing I was am so Proud.   I even did small things like decide where to put the picutres/posters.  I need to finish his office tho.  Well maybe when I find me a place to hire me I will be able to do all of that tooo. I know Ken and Justin will go far with this business.  I am so proud of Ken for doing all he is doing and for him pushing Justin into doing Ken. Ken had/has the vision.  He will make sure that company will go far,.  I cant wait for him to finish his book,,,, I am so really Proud of my husband.  I know that this man I love is so smart.  I hope this proves it to him.  Well I need some sleep before for I head off to "User Land"I have been so uugghh lately...I am trying to stop drinkning caffine....but it has been really rough...Plus I have a problem I dont know that will go away.  This may sound stupid..but I have a toe that I can not feel the tip of.. I thought it was because i was just cold..but I have put on really thick socks..and it is still feeling funny.  I guess if it doesnt get better tonight I will get it looked at tomorrow. I am scared.  I reallly like having this blogger...a place to put my thoughts that no one will ever read.I have so many thoughts....and so little time to put them here....I have so much I have to say.. I have alot of happiness, some sadness...and alot of worries.....  but I will be ok..... I just pray that all 4 of the children will be.Ok....I lost it 2 times...guess it wasnt meant for me to write here tonight.......Today...I was all happy....well there are some things in my life that I am not happy about...but I didnt know I was living a lie.  Today..someone who knows about me...and I dont know.. sent me a message that my husband wasnt happy with me.  Says that I do not make him happy in bed.  (that cut me like a knife..says he is bored with me already).  Told me that he is not happy with the way I keep our home.  I have to admit on this one..I am not happy with that either.  I have been talking to a Dr. explaining to him that I seem to not be able to get anything finished.  He took some blood work, but asked me about the things I have been worried about (I had a huge list) and he said his wife got like that.. we are still waiting on the test results, but he told me to take a breather and relax and stop worrying.(did I say with relaxation and some understanding his wife is better)  Well I am about in tears again and I hate when I do that at work.  See here is where the lie is... I thought my husband was happy with me. So I went along all happily thinking some of my life may suck but I have this husband I thought he understood that its not that I dont care... I care alot... I hate the way  things are kept.  Now what do I do?  Here I am saving up for things to make his office look great.  I have not been eating lunch so I could save money to do this...Now dont I feel stupid.  Cause this person even told me he was upset cause I never finished his office...but I was just waiting on getting pics of the kids and from our wedding and wanting to order the posters and things....Why cant I do anything correct...why cant I make anyone happy??OHHHHHHHHHHHH  AGONY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I swear I am having the LONGEST and WORST period every.  I feel like I am in constant PAIN!!!!  My darling husband is so sweet,  besides being so patient with me, he has been holding me so tight, and even laying his leg across my stomach to put pressure on it to keep the pain from being so bad!!!!!   I know I have the sweetest husband alive!!  I do love him so much.     I have to put in an insert concerning my DR appointment.,  I can tell the meds he put me on are working,  I am trying to hard to catch up on the house and things so I can finally be caught up and continue to keep a clean home.  But we have been through alot lately, and my poor baby keeps getting sick and my sweet hubby even broke his leg....GOODNESS!!  I feel so bad for them.  The older kids have been ok.  Kimberly was put on some meds for ADD but I do not like that at all.  Austin has been acting up, but he is still so sweet.   He wants to live with me so bad just like his sister.  Terry jr, well he really tries hard to be good, but sometimes he has to let go.   I think its the BIG brother syndrome.  I am so happy I have 4 wonderful children.I feel like shit.  We had friends coming over and I got up after a rough night of not sleeping and worring, and cleaned the house and wanted to make everthing look perfect for our friends and my husband.  I had a whole 2 hours of sleep.  Well they got here, and now look at me...I am at home again.  Everytime we get a chance to go out I get stuck at home. Last time I could not go because we have no sitter.  The time before that we did actually leave the house, His Aunt started acting up,we went home.  She went back out, he went to his friends house and guess what I stayed home and cleaned.  This time noone wanted to wait for the sitter.  You have no idea how I felt when I was told that I have to stay here. Sometimes I feel like such an outsider.I am so frustrated!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I want to clean my nasty ass house but I cant seem to find the time to do it right or I start but can never finish it.  By the time I leave work it is 600-630 and I dont get home til about 630-700.  Then I cook dinner and feed everyone (I usually eat standing up so I can get done faster) then I  make sure homework is done ,bath children,. Pickup the Kitchen  notice I did say pick up and not clean. by the time  i get a chance to go to the bathroom its 11 o'clock at night.  Then I think....  I can clean now...then I am too tired to do it .  My job is so mentally exhausting that It is hard to function when I get home.     I will clean my house,  I do not want to live in a pig stye.  I am so tired of it.  But, when I do get it clean I dare anyone to leave a mess.  I will go OFF>  I know I will.   I think my family is staying sick cause I cant get our house clean.   I want a HEALTHY AND HAPPY family.oh hum... Yesterday was a bad day for my Ken. I wanted to hold him all night long and make hard passionate love to him.  Sad thing is...I didnt feel like he wanted me.  this has really made me upset.  He laid next to me and masterbated....I normally do not care.  But this nite...I really wanted him.  I get up early so I laid down knowing he needed to have some unwind time.  Then he didnt really go to sleep until it was time for me to get up.  I am not really taking this personally..But it does hurt my feelings...I want my hubby to lay next to me and hold me all night.  Guess I am selfish for that.  But I dont like this feeling that he does not want me.  It really makes me feel awful.  I have been feeling bad since gaining some weight. (but I am working on that)....But I know he still loves me...I just want him to desire me.UUGGHHH......What a day...Why cant people leave MY family alone. I am talking about my family as in my husband, terry, kimberly Ausitn and Brian.  It started this morning.  Mawmaw called to see how Mymommie was doing.,...and how was her heart.  I told her that I think she is doing ok that I havent heard from her.  She started talking about what happen the other night and How she was told it was Mine and Misty's fault for taking the kids over there.  Well I told her it was my fault I am the one who asked Dad to watch the kids.  I am the one who was suppose to bring them over. If I knew what was going on then I would have not let my 4 children go.  I told her that I did not know what to say when the boys asked my what a Whore was.  She asked how Ken was...I told her that after the argument that him and mom had I was very worried about the both of them.  WEll the next thing I know I am getting another phone call from MOM......asking what did I tell MawMaw...well come to find out that mom told mawmaw she didnt cuss in front of the children and I let the cat out of the bag when I mentioned what the children heard...I didnt mean too...then she said why did you tell her what went on at my house..I didnt I just said they had an arguement.  Well Mom told me that she was going to tell Ken what a lousy DAD he is and that I am the one raising Brian.  That is not true.  Ken does alot with all of the kids and she has no right to say anything like that about my husband.  Well when I said yes he does do things with them she named off stuff a mom would normally do anyways....uugghh...THEN in the car Mawmaw called....She said she just got off the phone with mymommie and they had it out cause mawmaw told mymommie that she must not really love ken and brian and us because she is dragging us in it and hurting Ken in the process.  She then said that she told mymommie that if she is not careful about what she says around Brian then all that we have fought for will be gone.  That Stacey will find a way to take Brian away.  Then she said mom told her that if she called the HRS right now..that they would take all 4 kids away.  (this is not true.  i have been working real hard on getting caught up on all of this.) But me and my big mouth repeated what Mawmaw had said.  And Kimberly heard it.  The first thing Kimberly did when she got in the house was start throwing up.  It made her so upset. I asked her what was wrong and she asked me who would call the HRS  and make them take them away from me and Daddy (that is what our daughter calls ken).  I told her not to worry about it cause it would not happen...But I hated to see her have that reaction. I do love my family and I love mom and Dad...but why ...I dont understand any of this.  I am not going to question it I am not going to mention it to Ken....cause I dont want him any sicker than he is...but it does seem that I may have to start posting here alot to keep me sane.  I dont want to go off on anybody messing with my family.  But I will.  NOONE is going to seperate us 6.  THIS IS MY FAMILY and I will fight anyone who wants to tear us apart.MY HUSBAND...... I love my husband with all my heart.  I hope he really does know much Love him.  I am so mad at his mother right now that it isnt funny.  She knows that he is a depressive person and that we have been struggling..not personally but with finances....and what does she do?? She drags him in the middle of her and his dad.  I love my mother n law very much....but I hate to see my Husband treated that way. I was so worried about him last night.  I was afraid he was pushed tooo far last night.  He doesnt realize how much I worry about that and it does make me angry when I see someone who knows about him ... to push him that far....  I am also upset that she talked in front of the kids the way she did.  Brian and Austin told me that she yelled at them to be quiet when they tried to talk to her when they were at their Dadaddies. And they both asked my what a WHORE was.  Because she kept saying that in front of the them that their Dadaddy had his whore in her house.  I wish the kids would of never went over there.  I pray to god that Brian doesn't go to his mothers house and say what he heard.  We have fought so hard for him that I pray nothing ever happens to turn the judges decision around.  I know she is hurting and I do understand.  But I pray for now on that Ken and the Kids do not get stuck in the middle.  I never knew I was capable of loving someone as much as I love him. They also say that you cant love a child that is not yours as much as you do your own...that is  a LIE.....I love Bri - Bri just like if I was the one who had him.  Well I guess I should stop writing,,,but my mind is so full....and I am so scared and worried about my husband right now. I have been praying ever night that God takes special care of him to help him through all of this.WHY CANT  I STOP FUCKING THINGS UP?????????????????????????Lately I have felt as if Ken doesnt find me attractive anymore.  I have been trying to diet. But now...I am going to do more than that...I am going to Diet.  I cant figure out what else may be wrong.  I want my husband to want me.  In the last month he has stayed up more than laying down with me.  I know his back is hurt and I know I was on my period.  But I truely feel as if he isnt interested in me.  Damn it my heart hurts.  But I will do what ever I can to make him want me again.I am so PISSED off that it isnt funny.  I dont think I have been this mad in a long time.  I should of known when I woke up in such a wonderful mood.  Did 2 loads of laundry a dishewasher full of dishes got my son up and cooked for him and my husband, I felt great!!!!    The day at work was a Monday but I could handle it.  Then my private line rings.  Its Amy.   Asking me if ken was going to go to work today!   I said yes he is going to try hard to get there.  She said Well I need to know now not later.  I called Ken to make sure he was feeling kinda ok.  He was in pain and took some meds he was going to wait for the meds to set in before going to work.  WELL I called that bitch back to let her know then she started in on me, she said that she needed to know now and that she couldnt wait til later to find out if she needed to find someone to teach this class.    She said the classroom needed to be set up and I asked if she was sure.  One of the classes the students do it.   She started in on me....WELL rick said....blah blah blah....YOU KNOW WHAT....I dont give a FUCK what RICK says.   He needs to keep his ass out of that OFFICE . I am so tired of people like that BITCH and like the COKE snorting geek to walk all over ken.  And now look...I am so pissed off I cant enjoy my family tonight.   Why cant everyone leave my family alone?????   Ya know....Ken is doing what he loves but he cant enjoy it.  I realized a while back that I wanted to work for a company and do some networking while teaching the others the enjoyment Networking can be, like Ken did me.  And because someone ran their mouth and lied saying that he took took my MCSE tests that I didnt get the job that Justin had promised.  DAMN IT...... and now I am stuck in this stupiud ass position talking to users who cant even remember to take a floppy out of the drive. Or loose their shit cause  you tell them not to stoere stuff on the hard drive and then their computer crasses, or the user who fucking cant even find the start button.  NO WAIT the best one yet.  The vice president of the bank who blames you for him typing in the generic password wrong , when all it is , is the name of the company and he says its your fault he cant spell it write.  UUGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH   if I find out who told him that Ken took my MCSE after I studied hard and sent my kids to my moms for a month so I could do nothing but study, and .....I will kill that mother fucker.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I have only had a few dreams in my life and being an Engineer was one of them,  I have a couple of more some will come true some wont.........but damn it.   someones lie is  going to keep me from doing my dream.  I just knew if I got in with a small company then a larger company would notice me.  Or we could of made that company big.  Oh well....aint nothin I can do about it now,...what is said is said.....what is done is done.......But I warn ya now.....I will slap the cunt if she talks to me again in that tone of voice.  This is a warning and a promise.  It is not a threat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1I never talk about sex / love making between my husband and my self.   But, last night I cried when he was making love to me.  Not because it was rough, not because he hurt me.  But because, I have never felt such love and tenderness in all my life.   It was the most amazing time I have ever had.   He made love to every inch of my body. The feeling of his hands running gently across me as he made me shut my eyes and not open them as he caressed me not knowing where he would touch next.  His sweet, tender Kisses.  The  words that he was saying to me.  Hearing the love in his voice when he  told me he loved me over and over again. We of course had made love a lot, had sex a lot, fucked a lot.  but last night was just amazing. The true  feeling of love.     This was truely one of the best nights of making love that we have ever had.  The other one I would put above this and I cried that night too, was the night we made love that it was so wonderful that he set the date for the wedding.  I never knew I could love someone like this and to be honest, sometimes its scary.  I want to protect my heart.  But I know deep down I dont need to protect it from him.  One of these days I will let me guard 100% down and he will realize that I love him as much as I say I do.  I thank God every morning and every night that he gave me such a wonderful family.  He gave me kimberly and austin and terry..knowing I would gather strength, and wisdom and give my love to and grow with.  He gave me Brian and ken to also share my love with, I have so much to give all of them. I think he gave me Brian to grow with as well, and to love with a special love. But Ken, I think he gave me him for a special reason.  God knew that I had love to give, but he also knew that I needed love and I did not know (dont) how to accept it.  I think he put us 2 together, because he knew we both needed true love and he knew Ken would teach me, not only to accept love but to teach me how to be love and how to give love to a man.  I know this sounds sappy.  But I really KNOW not think...that Ken is my  soul mate.I have learned. I am not a good person.  I went out last night, with the intent to get my nipples peirced.  I had to wait on the guy so Misty said lets go have a drink.  I didnt think my husband would mind.  I thought it would relax me. We got the drink and then went and got the percing.  WEll husband did mind. I screwed up my marriage and I am not sure if I can fix it.  My heart hurts, my neck hurts, my throat hurts. My nipples hurt.  I was told last night I was a bitch ,.  Well I guess I am....I was told I was like Stacey. That hurt me more than anything.  I try to make sure he has everything he needs and some of what he wants.  I didnt realize I was such a bad person, but I do know now.  I was told I was having an affair.  He said with my ex husband.  That is the grossest thing that I have ever heard.  If that man ever touched me again I would cut off his dick..cut off his hand and place the dick in it.  I was the scaredest I have ever been last night, why? becuase I let a drink come between my husband and me.  It didnt scare me that I was held down.  hurt like hell, not breathing is scary but I must of deserved it.  Just like I told Misty, he wouldnt hurt me without a reason cause he loves me.    I will never go to a family function again.  Cause all knows.   I wont tell them I made him so mad that he held me down by the throat, that is embarrassing,(I didnt mean for that to happen) I wish the bruises on my neck were not there, and the scratches on my face cause I dont want anyone to know.  His mom must of told maw-maw,  cause now she is calling.  I guess everyone thinks I am Stacey now.  Is there need to stay in this family? Yes there is, because I love him.  But I will NEVER go to family functions again. cause NOW I know that I will be treated as Stacey and I am no stacey.  I gucked up one night.  I have to go get my house in order.  I wont have time ever again to sit down and type. So I say GOODBYE to everyone.I dont know what to think about me any more.  I use to think I was a good wife and a good mother.  But I must not be.  The other day,  I made Ken a dinner that really sucked.  I was trying to make a great dinner and it turned out to be the worst ever.  Then he told me how I should keep our house clean but I dont.  It is my responsiblity, but I cant seem to get it done.  I have been trying hard to play catch up.  Tonight I am staying up to finish the laundry. But today out of no where.  My mother n law came over, returned her computer?!  (still not sure why) and then told me that she would be coming over to help me clean house and iron everyweek,  That really made me feel inadequate.  Plus the oldest 3 really acted up today.  But I truely think that is because they had to go home to their dads and did not want to. But it made Ken feel like they were picking on Brian.  So see...I am not a good wife, and not a good mother.  Cause if I was either,  none of this would of happened.  It seems the harder I try, the worse I get.  DAMN IT!!  I really hate me.I have so many thoughts running through my head.  I asked Ken to take me for a drive last night.  But the kids were all up late.  I wanted to talk to him.  But last night again, he got up set with me and didnt come to bed until morning.  He accused me of not wanting to blow him any more.  That is so far from the truth. He doesnt know that in our fight the other night a tooth got broke.  IT HURTS...and that in the inside of my mouth I had a HUGE swollen layer on the inside of my lip with a cut on it.  It hurt to eat more less blow.  But I didnt want to tell him cause I did not want to hurt him,  But come to find out.  It hurt him cause I didnt blow him.  I do love him with all my heart and I didnt know if it would hurt him if he knew I really got hurt the other night.  One more bruise left and It will all be over with.  THANK GOD!!   I love my husband with all my heart and I will never do anything like that again.OK...so my day is starting out like SHIT....Our Child Austin was given a puppy, well the Puppy has worms bad and with my schedule I am not off when the vet clinic is open.  NOw I just learned that a PAPER MCSE has been promoted to level 3 UGHHHHHHHHHH.....why cant I get promoted.  Its really pissing me off.  I want a decent job.  I want a job that makes me have to think.  When I think on this job I get introuble.  Go figure.  OH WELL.   such is life.I am so pissed at my ex -  He made me live through HELL when I was pregnant knowing he did not want the babies he created.  But, then he gets his Girlfriend pregnant and he is thrilled.  And to beat all..he is going through the clothes I saved that my kids had when they were little, and is going to let his new baby wear then.. GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.....  You know what I dont understand why do guys want babies by other people and not by me?  I wish Ken was the dad of my children he is a wonderful father.  I love to watch him with Brian, and with the older kids!    He plays with them, loves on them, scolds them.  He is so perfect!   I found the most perfect man.My darling Husband did it.  He got the job.  He went to sign the papers today.  and then we had lunch.   It is so wonderful to see him as happy as he has been the last two weeks.  I keep telling him I have all the confidence in the world in him.  He doesnt realize sometimes just how smart he is.  Its just not smart.,  Its the Knowledge that he has and his ability to actually put it to use.  I think that is one of the things that attracts me to him too...I love a smart man.    Ok now on a uggh note.....I dont know why I am so afraid to show him how much I love him. I tried last week, but it was at the wrong time, and was accused of just loving on him cause he got that job.  Which isnt the truth...but did want to show him how proud I was/am of him.    Another note:  I am so glad that our baby Brian is back home.  Last week, we all 5 missed him so much....but this week I am having real problems missing the oldest 3.  I dont know when the last time it has hurt this much not to have them with me.  I am so lonely for them.   I am also having some serious problems with sleep...I cant seem to do it.  I am tired.  but cant seem to sleep...What is up with that??  My medicine for calming my nerves is missing as well.  Thats a whole other story....Why does not anyone ever listen to me?  I have tried to explain to everyone how it makes me feel and they seem to not care at all.  I dont mind help I really do not, but... I can iron.  I dont mind helping me match since I cant see some colors....But it makes me feel so Inadequate when someone has to come into my house and do something I should be doing.  I have tried to be nice about it... and I did not mean to get ill, I could not help it,  I just wanted to cry.  It makes me feel that I am not doing what I am suppose to be doing and that I am a failure.   I have said this...over and over again...but yet noone cares.  It makes me think also that they do not like the job that I do when I do iron (which is every day but weekends) .   AND.....I NEVER!!  let the kids leave without combing their hair and brushing their teeth!   What it looks like when they come home from school I cant help.   Well I am done steaming....Its not really steaming its just that my feelings are really hurt.  I mean hurt bad.Yesterday,  Everything was going as normal.   MyMommie picked up Brian from school.  I met them at the gas station.   Brian asked if he could go in with me when I was going in there to pay.  He kept holding myhand and saying...I love you mommy. I love you mommy.  Of course I was telling him I love him too.   Well when they left he kept calling me, just to say I love you and to chat.  I finally asked him what is wrong because Brian does not really like to stay on the phone and talk.  He told me he did not want to go at all today.  He says that alot...but today...I know he is serious.  After I talked to Him he talked to his Daddy.   After talking to his daddy, Stacey called and demanded to have Brain for 30 days.   That is not how it works.  It is not what is in his divorce papers.   After both of them cussed at Ken we called our attorney.  He in turn called them and let them know that we will be filing for a clarification of terms, and that they could keep my baby for a week.  But we must get him back.  will finish later.   6/6/03 Well it sounds as if we wont get our baby through the summer except for weekends.  UUGGHH....I will miss him sooo much.....  I want all 4 of my kids around all the time.    I really hate that his mom wants him to be around the abuse that goes on in that house.   I know we are basing it on what a 5 year old says...but I know he would not make up what he has said.ok.....Why won't it go away??  I don't understand.    The more I fight the feeling the more it comes.  I swore I would never write on this again.  but I since I am pretty much sure noone ever reads this.....But......I truely crave to have his baby.  I want a part of him to grow inside me. to nuture.  and to know that when the baby is born that the baby will have a dad who loves her/him intensly.  And have grandparents around too.   I know he does not want a child (which I do but dont understand) I try real hard to cover my feelings about this..but sometimes it makes me ill.  (which I dont understand at all either)  I do not know how to explain this but love....I love him so much...I want something of his...something we can share...something that we can both love and grow with.  also,  noone could ever take this child away from us.     OK...I am about to cry again...but I had to write this out ...so I can STOP thinking about it.You know, when someone asks you....what do you reallly want????????  all I can think of is to have my Kens baby.............................I pray that I can stop this feeling....its hurts my heart so.... to know I cant give him and he does not want...the one thing that I want to give him.........Please lord take this feeling away..........6/6/03 Thursday night Ken and I stayed up so he could start getting his "body" schedule changed. I went to sleep for about 2 hours,  On Friday, Kens mom had to take brian to his mom so ken could go to work WELL........... Brians mom decides she is not going to return him.    Friday night Mymommie gets put into the hospital with an extremely dangerously high blood pressure.  (stayed with her all night went straight from hosptial to work)  Couldnt get it down, kept her.    Sunday our 3 children came.....went to hospital tovisit mymommie while Ken went to work. On MOnday ran an Heart Cath. (Didnt work so I could be with family)  (Heart cath was suppose to be at 9 am didnt do it til after 2)  Was going to send her home but decided since they couldnt find out a reason why they could not get it down. (Went to Kens attorney about Brian...Ken had to sign papers on how visitation is for the summer) (Went to movies got home after midnight)    Tuesday morning,  (MIDNIGHT)  MOM starts running a 103 fever.  (also friday was kens first day of working nights).  they ran all kinds of test.....Did not hear anything from her test. Wednesday - Her heart rate is down but not her temp.    Still waiting to hear.  They send her home Thursday - Ronnie Chesser steals Austins dog.....called police they wont help. Called the sherriff, wrote up a report.   They did not turn it in.  Austin TOld Cathy we spent the whole night at the police dept Friday - Busy at work...could not sign out warrant yet.  Found out Stacey signed the papers but cant go pick up Brian cause Judge hasnt signed it.I feel so sick to my stomach.  Its a little of combonation of cramps....and a ucky feeling.  This weekend  We went to see my parents.  Ken and I got into an arguement on the way down there.  I didnt realize how unhappy I made him.  He gave me an ultimatum. I have to get the house clean in 2 days or he leaves me.  I am worried til I am so sick.  I hated leaving my mom.   I had to make my kids (well atleast 2 of them) go with their dad cause they did not want to. And now I am so worried that I am loosing him.  He has been asking me what is wrong.  I dont want him to know I am worriing.  I actually feel like I am going to throw up.  I hate feeling ill.  But I do not want to go through life with out him.  The sad thing is ....  I truely understand why he would leave me and I dont blame him an inch.  I wish I could be a better wife.  I am going to pray all night that GOD makes me a better wife and mother.  I feel so lonely tonight.  I want to be held.  I am no where near having the house clean.  but If I dont lay down I will get sick.   I just wish I could sleep some.  I do love him so.my heart hurts. My baby is wants to leave me.  How did it come to that?  It is all my fault.  I dont like feeling this way.  I want to show him that I love him.  But at the same time.  I am scared to show him cause it will hurt me even more when he leaves.  This is tearing me up.  I really do not think that he knows how much my love is for him.NOt a kiss...not a goodbye ...Not a hon I am going anywhere.  He must really hate me now.I just found out I have 36 hours of vacation left and 8 hours of PDO.    I am going to see if one weekend that it is just Ken and I that we take some personal time together and go somewhere. Right now my heart is hurting... we seem so far apart,  I do  not want that to happen.  I cant loose the love of my life.I dont understand why, when I think things are starting to look up and going to start being great, that it seems as if  I am wrong.  I dont know why he is so distant from me these last 2 days.  I have tried to show him I love him.  I have wanted to make love to him badly. (Unfortunately he is sleeping durning alot of those times).  I just want to go in wake him up and devour him.  He thinks I do not want him.  I do not know what to do. I do not want to loose my husband, I truelly love him.  I have to figure out a way that he knows all the time that I love him.  Next weekend is our annivserary.  They say the first year is the hardest.  I sure the hell hope so.Sometimes I feel as if he is getting so distance.  I understand I have alot on me and I may seem the same way...but... I just pray that he doesn want to get distance.  I still do not think..that man knows how much I love him!urlLink Ngugi wa Thiong'o,  a critical person in my personal learning and development was attacked (and his wife) two days ago in Nairobi. It was the first time in 22 years he had been back after self-imposed exile. He lived in London and then moved to New York to teach comparative literature. He was in Nairobi for a one month lecture tour organized by his publishers.  He was a writer from Kenya, with books including  Weep Not Child   (1964),  The River Between   (1965)  The Grain of Wheat   (1967) and  Petals of Blood  (1977). One of the first books that excited me politically was  Decolonising the mind: the politics of language in African literature   (1986). After 20 years of writing in English Ngugi went back to writing in his first language Gikuyu, arguing that the only way to break from neocolonialism was to develop a subversive literature in languages of peasants and workers.   Both his literature and his politics were important to me and he was the one who set me on the trail of thinking about English as an international language. In fact I have a photo of  moi  in earnest discussion with him at a political meeting in London back in the 1980's.   His writing opened doors for me to other post-colonial writers and eventually to more recent writers such as Alasdair Pennycook ( The cultural politics of English as an international langauge,   1994: Longman), James Tollefson (including  Planning language, planning inequality,   1991:Longman) and Norman Fairclough (including  Language and Power,    1989: Longman). And then, of course, to Fairclough and critical discourse analysis.  I never fully agreed with Ngugi going back to writing only in Gikuyu and would be interested one day to find out what difference his decision made - culturally, politically or spiritually to the world.  I agree with Pennycook who said: “While it is indeed important to write politically in the local languages of the people, it is also important, perhaps imperative, to engage with the English language. Language is not merely a  means  to engage in struggle but it is also a principal  site  of struggle, and thus to take up a cultural political project must require a battle over the meanings of English."Why i am doing this .... spending time .. money ... resources ....... for a Gmail account ? :D partly because it offers 1 GB ( spymac does that too ... big deal ? ) + latest fab in town .....

It is the essential Bollywood formula love story, with a twist: Girl meets boy. Girl hates boy. Girl meets boy again. They fall in love.  The film opens at the airport with the protagonists, Karan Kapoor (Saif Ali Khan) and Rhea Prakash (Rani Mukherjee), leaving for New York. Rhea's mother, Parminder Prakash aka Bobby (Kirron Kher), is busy praying for her daughter's safety.  Karan is accompanied by mom Anu Kapoor (Rati Agnihotri) and good friend Mihir Vora (Jimmy Shergill). He believes that 'boys' and 'girls' can never understand each other, let alone be friends.  Both Karan and Rhea are seated next to each other in the aircraft, and the ice is broken. Karan shows Rhea his cartoon characters, Hum and Tum, the quintessential boy and girl who cannot live with or without each other!  At a stopover in Amsterdam, they explore the city and their differences together. Just as Rhea drops her guard around Karan, he kisses her, only to be slapped. They part on that sour note.  Three months later, they bump into each other at a New York park. Karan is with his girlfriend Shalini (Shenaz Treasurywala). Shalini and Rhea discover they are school friends. Rhea tells Shalini all about the Amsterdam episode, at the end of which Karan and Shalini split.  Cut to three months later, when Karan is back in Delhi with his mother. She is a wedding coordinator and ropes Karan in to help with a wedding. The bride turns out to be Rhea.  Karan bumps into Rhea again on a French train, where she cryptically tells him, "Samir is no longer part of my life." Karan lands up at his father's (Rishi Kapoor) Parisian house and tries to find Rhea.  Will Karan find Rhea? Where is Samir? Will they realise that they love each other? Will they be together? This constitutes the rest of film.  Hum and Tum, Karan's cartoon characters, pop up now and again. They experience the incidents that happen to Karan and Rhea — in animation.  This urban romance, which spans six years and many cities — Amsterdam, New York, Paris, Delhi and Mumbai — is an easy watch. The movie is essentially episodic in nature, and the episodes have been woven well together. The characters are also well defined.  There is a plausible, if simplistic, storyline. Like when Rhea alights from the train, she doesn't give Karan either her number or her address. Karan still traces her phone number and reaches her mother.  The film does suffer from continuity problems. At her mehendi ceremony, Rhea dances around Karan in the Gore gore song. The mehendi in alternate scenes changes from wet, dark green to light orange to dark orange. The next scene shows Rhea's forearm covered in a dark maroon mehendi design, but the palm is clean.  In the beginning of another scene, Karan is shown to be drunk and tottering around. All of a sudden, he finds his balance, walks straight, and is so sober that he proceeds to run and find a victoria and come back to where Rani is waiting.  Also, it isn't quite clear why Karan and Rhea do give up their inhibitions. Why would a girl who is so independent get close to a guy she is not sure of?  But Kunal Kohli does a fair job. The direction is tight in most places. The title song, though, is placed badly and detracts from the narrative. It can be safely deleted from the movie.  Saif is perfect for the role as Karan, the smooth-talking urban male whose main aim in life is to get every woman to date him. In fact, this role would be a natural progression to his Dil Chahata Hai role. The film rests on his shoulders. From the irresponsible 22 year-old off to America, his character has been developed well over the next six years in the movie. As usual, Saif scores with his comic timing.  Rani continues with her Chalte Chalte tanned look for this film. She has done a competent job as the level-headed, no-nonsense Punjabi girl who knows what she wants. She excels in the tear-jerking scenes and matches Saif in the comic ones.  Kirron Kher as Rhea's mother is superb, with her Punjabi accent and mannerisms. The other supporting actors, Rishi Kapoor, Rati Agnihotri, Jimmy Shergill, and Ishaa Koppikar, are adequate.  All told, a feel-good film which will appeal to urban audiences.Well got a idea today ....... start a blog ..... be regular ...... paste crap ./ get a GMail account :D   Mihirhi all ... this is the first oneHi people,   Sorry i have not regular to my posts ( dont even know if anyone sees this or not :) ) anyway i am kinda new to this ..... and dont properly know how to blog ... so if u still see it ... kindly bear with me .. and mail ur comments to mihirsaxena@spymac.com will be waiting for them    Today was a pretty boring day ..... ended on a great note though. A interesting thing happened. One of the classmates was online. He had a crush on a girl ( OK OK no crush ... just something crush like ;) ) Anyway that girl ... one the last day of college ( i passed out this yr ) told him that she had a cruch on him ........ biy wasnt my friend like some lightning hit him :) .. anyway will keep u all updates on this :)    MihirLots of drama today on Tv regarding the prime minister of India .... really politics in our country has become a matter of comedy. You do not know who is against whom? or who has what  policies. Thats the reason why people are getting disenchanted with the politics.  Anyway spent the whole of day sleeping ......... after spending yesterday's night finishing "Call of Duty", this was expected. I am expecting the courier from Navendu with new games tommorrow .... will help in spending time further.     thats all for today .... will again post tommorrow   MihirHi people,   This is my another attempt at starting a blog of mine ... previous attempts died a unnatural death ........ anyway lets hope this will continue :)   Mihirgreat ..... i am going to Calcutta tommorrow to submit my IIM-Calcutta fees .... so it now 99.99% sure that i will be a Jokaite for the next 2 yrs :) ..... wish me good journey atleast yaaron ;P    MihirWell Champions League final today ... was supporting AS Monaco, actually i am a big fan of Morietes ( he's cute na ? :) ) Anyway match was good .... but heartbreak for Monace as they lost 3 - 0 to Porto. Both sides were really equal, but Porto took their chances with perfection. I thought the injury to Monaco's captain in the first half hit them really hard and their top players did not perform to the occasion.   Well as far as the rest of the day is concerned, waited and waited for Himanshu (friend from school) to turn up ... but he did not come ..... Really i am very angry as he made me get up early in the morning ( 9 am :(( ) and then i was sitting like a fool expecting him :(   Anyway .. tommorrow hopefully i will get a second telephone line, and then be able to be online practically 24X7 ......    Cioa for now    Mihirhi guys,    well pretty bored out here .... got nothing to do .. except sleeping , playing computer games, watching movies..... god knows how the next 1 month will pass. Got something to do ...... i have to go to Calcutta if IIM-B waitlist does not turn up in my favour and deposit my fees there. So 3 days out of the way there :) then a couple of days to Varanasi to get my certi's attested along with maybe a trip to Delhi.   I finished up Halo today, good game ... great storyline, have a feeling Halo 2 will be even greater. Loved the vehicles that u can drive in the game, a real novelty.    Thats all .. rest later :)I just returned from a long trip to Calcutta, one which was probably my most adventurous ever. I am dead tired, just came here to check my emails. Will post details tommorrowThis post comes from the hallowed portals of IIM-C ... yes the B-school where i am going to spend next 2 years of my life. I have come here to submit the fees personally ... ( done it :) ). Well the journey was a story in itself.  A fairly long story actually. I had my train reservation frm my home town Jhansi. I missed the train by just 5 min on Saturday morning. What followed was nothing less than a Bollywood blockbuster ( ok ..... a lot less than that ... but still a lot :) ) A had to catch a bus to Kanpur, ... spent 5 hours in the heat and humidity of Bundelkhand as the rickety bus travelled to Kanpur. The other ticket that i had got after missing my train was not confirmed, i had been waitlisted at number 13. Well ... i found out that my status then was number 8, but had no chances of getting confirmed. Now i had to urgently reach Calcutta to deposit the fees, so ... i bribed a coolie on the station ..( well it seems to me that the job of coolies at Kanpur station is not to carry the luggage of passengers ... but rather to "help" poor fellows like me in getting a berth in the train they want ( of course after charging a hefty fees:) ) ) I had to pay the fellow 100 bucks .... then the ticket collector another 500 bucks over the fare diffrence between 2 AC and 3 AC ........ 1100 bucks down the drain :( just for the delay of 5 min ... can u imagine.   Anyway the rest of the journey was fine ..... did not have to experience the heat .... I tried to take a look out of the window during the travel ... but was really shocked by the state of affairs in Bihar ... villages on the track side seemed to be straight out of some old age movie with thacthed roofs and all .. .did not think that there was as backward a place as Bihar.   Anyway .. more of it in the next post ... am off to try and find myself some thing to eat :)    MihirIt is Sunday, the June 6th today :) No no, nothing special about it, just that it is first time on a sunday that i have been up before 12 :) I have been trying to catch up on sleep as i know i wont be getting lots of it surely for the next 2 yrs atleast in IIM-B. One doubt i have though , when i was entering engineering, i had the sale impression about engineering college as well, but it turend out to be 4 years of holidays :) Lets see how this one turns out. Waise one resolution i have taken, i will work hard this time around, and i will try my level best to keep up my grades unlike my life in engg. So lets see how this resolution turns out to be.It is Sunday, the June 6th today :) No no, nothing special about it, just that it is first time on a sunday that i have been up before 12 :) I have been trying to catch up on sleep as i know i wont be getting lots of it surely for the next 2 yrs atleast in IIM-B.

So lets see how this resolution turns out to be.Wow..this daily thing is kind of getting to me...I'm surprising myself, by the fact that I might be going on this thing more often..=). Slow uneventful things in life...but all gets posted. Also on IRC a.t.m...but going soon...the huge-ass printer is printing...no wait, I'm lost..it just finished. Anyhow..yeah...it's okay..n/m..I'm out.  Got to hand in stuff.. RO server! http://www.enigmaro.com  OR!!  Join #EnigmaRO @ irc.irchighway.net!~  Muahahaha...  Yeah.http://www.motellmaffian.com/bakgrunder/  Whoa. All I can say is..this place has some nice backgrounds. I don't use 'em myself...but it's pretty good eye-candy. Once again...I'm sittin' down in Comm..well, Comm 29, to be precise. Stewart's bein' a bitch, walkin' around, telling people what to do. For all who know and hate her, say "aye!". I can see plenty of hands already...  For all who don't? Let's just say..the injustice of being a student, sucks. Totally. I'm definitely failing three courses...probably failing another...and thanks to some bogus messed up test, I probably can't get to summer school for physics, too. Life just bites.  Maybe, on the other hand..there are some relieving things...summer's coming up..summer school is coming up..so I can stay away from home for a bit longer...see h.e.r for a bit more...but then back down to the messed up life of hell in the summer...  ..damn, it's the end of 4th, i got to get to patel, talk to her about my poster...and see what'll happen to me in English, if I can make it to summer.  Take care.  (Insert: Oh, by the way, did I tell you I failed my Unit 8 Physics test? I got to talk to Skillicorn tommorrow ...and ..uhh..yeah.)..oh damn. I'm sitting here in Media Arts...bored..and working on Flash. God damn it..shut up, Ken. He just said, "If you're so-called working on Flash, why are you doing this?" By 'this', he meant doing this blog. Heck, the only reason I've made a return to this was cux Jose told me if I went back to blog, I'd get an invite for g-mail.  For all who are out of the loop, it's e-mail that's...uhh..it's got 1 gig of space, and the motto? "The Keyword: Search, don't sort." I WANT THAT ONE GIG!...=( Hey, it's useful for all the "junk" that I get.  Ken's taunting me about my sucky laptop again. Why do I feel so sad? =P...oh heck..well, back to whatever I'm doing..so yeah...I'm out. Probably update again, later....so..i've started once again. After more than a year's hiatus on this thing, and thanks to Keane's unprevailing effort on recovering my blog, I've reverted to a cheap template. Which by me, looks fine. I don't care anymore. As long as I've got the content..yeah..I'll be fine. So heck.  Guess what? It's June 1st. The last few days of school are in progress...and I'm pretty much dead. Life. Work. Parents. Wtf. Eh. Other than resting, fighting, playing around..and spending time with...well.yeah... I'm out of the loop. Don't know if I can actually keep this blog thing up for long, either. See if people actually come. And do stuff...yeah.  Smile. =).  Cool.*looks at previous post again*  Maybe I was imagining it... maybe I should sleep... "Maybe you should shut up."  *blinks*  Oh gee, sooorry.*looks at previous post*  I wonder why the first Paragraph was a different font face... Probably because of the line breaks.I'm going to change what this blogger looks like...  I don't like the colour, and I was thinking of adding a picture of Hikaru from Hikaru no Go... but I might change it to a Go Board.  Does Kifu sound suitable for this? It's like a record (play by play) of a Go game. So it basically tells how a game went, similar to a journal, ne?   Meh , I'll work on writing more when I finish the template. -ArVSo...  This is a sort of Journal thing?    Rei told me about it, and she got it from Kas... I wonder how long I can keep up with this one...I was right...    I'm currently downloading the X series.... Unfortunately it kept saying  Failed . I couldn't understand why...   Then  I noticed my Hard Drive was full... had to do transfering and deletions... *sigh* BUT! Episodes started downloading again! ^-^  -ArVaww.......*thinks to past* i dun member last time i had civies....but ne one who forgets is considred a big.......L-O-S-E-R!!!!!!1 LOL!!!!!! *pokes* u 2 r sooo cute.......*giggles* course itz easier not to kno about a civies day @ ur school...so i wont hold it againt yas......^-~ HoS|-|i*I know eh?     Don't feel too badly about the civies and all, I missed the only day I was supposed to get civies because no one told me there was... ^^;;   The anchors looks really good, glad you fixed it all up! Things are definitely looking up *looks up*   Anyhows, busy and interesting month coming... soon there will be International night and the art show to work on. Actually, as a matter of fact, we're working on it right now... let's see: for International Night, we *pointz at self, keane and von* are in charge of the japanese pavilion and we have a bunch of stuff planned. Hopefully they all will work ^^;; As for the art show, the same group of people are going to work on a comic... hopefully that works too!   As for just myself, I'm joining up for badminton... I know for a fact I'm not going to make it, cause I only play for fun... some people there take lessons and go to tournaments!! Ah well, it's the fun that all matters.    ~ ChronosAh that sucks...    But what's worse was that I remembered to wear civies clothes today, but... it  wasn't  a civies day!!! Good thing I had my uniform in my bag... -.-* Paranoia can come in handy some times...  -ArVI'm only on to say this...    Today... as well as yesterday were Civies days for me.  Good thing I forgot to wear civies! @.@  -ArVooo do i haveta put a "title" tooooooo??      *coughs* well, well, i c dat this site is going fairly well....*looks around* ten times better than  mine  *clears throat* demo...ne wayz..i hope u guys r doing ait, and dat u Boo-chan r getting ur work done =-= oooo Em! maybe *light bulb* maybe me or Boo-chan can put up a link to ur site! ^-^ sugoi???   *heehee....ja ne....HoS|-|i*Nobody can say I don't listen...    I added the linkage at the bottem of all posts yesterday. In doing so, I spent all my time without updating my blog. >.  I might not be updating here as often... That doesn't mean other's cannot post!  *sigh* I got 80 on Rei-chan's test   while Joe got 90???   HOW???  *cough*Cheater*cough*  Well, that's all for today...  -ArVI will not put a title for this one...     ...cause i can't think of a good one.   Anyways, today i went to mandarin class ... and guess what I found?? Keane wasn't there!! My first thought was like: "Has he started skipping sat classes to go to hoshi-chan's house?", then later I asked hoshi-chan and she's like: "no... haven't seen him...", and I was thinking: "ohh... he must be sick... I should phone him", but then hoshi-chan phones him first and then tells me: "Keane didn't go to sat class cause he slept in."  *Face-fault*  ... and there i was hoping he was ok...  grrr ...    On to sadder news... I got 94% on mid-term exam and 91% in midterm overall for my sat class... and I hafta say that really sucks. No really... it does... cause this stuff is like extremely easy...   Started playing a bit of Warcraft... haven't gotten addicted to it... and I hope I don't...*mutterz*  3vil 3ric...     On a misc. note... i think we should end off all the blog entries with something that can snap you back to the top of the page... think anchors.Testing...    I'm testing the "Blog This" link found at the bottom of the settings page... if you're reading this, I guess it works!  -ArVHe was studying...    A lot of Grade Tens were up late last night finishing History Day projects that were due today. -.-*  *sigh* I was angry too!!! But he had to finish it... *sigh*  -ArVo.O Chronos!!!!!!!

Make my inbox have an anime picture!!! ^-^  Ah yes, finally my dad said 'let's go!'  -ArVGawd...    My dad is taking so long to get ready... All he has to do is drop me off, then he can come back... I think he wants me to be late... @.@  -ArVWha...? Today is soon tomorrow..?     Chronos here, wasting ArV's blogger space again.   Pshiness! Tired because of a simple less-than-an-hour class? Yeesh... I'm weaker than you and I'm not tired from it. Hehe, as for that test... I think I'm going to fail it...didn't practice the reversal and couldn't perfect the scarf-hold...   Ah... history project... need... to...finish... tired...want...sleep...but...CAN'T!...    ~Chronos...till the end of Time   *later in the night... or early in the morning*   ok...it's like 2:45am... but at least I'm done! Yay! *collapse*   ~Chronos...till the end of Time   *5-10 min later*   Woot! Staying up this early was all worth it! I'm one of the first people to read the new Megatokyo comic for this Friday! Ahh... finished listening to Invoke for like the 20th time... found that it was one of the few songs that can keep me energetic in such a desperate time... hehehehe... too tired to get high though... *flops*   Don't get me wrong though... I like "Invoke"... but I still like "Northern Lights" the most! "Do You Be-Li-Eve In Des-Ti-Ny?!"   Now off to bed I go before my parents wake up and kill me... ^-^;;;   ~Chronos...till the end of TimeI'm Catholic...    But you correct me when I say "god" by making it "God" so often that it's become a habit to capitalize that word.     Rei-chan and Jade-san visted our school yesterday. Jamie-san visited today. Fun. m-i-c-k-e-y-m-o-u-s-e. Mickey Mouse... Mickey Mouse, m-i-c-k-e-y-m-o-u-s-e.  I'm so tired... Today was the fourth Self Defence class. Tomorrow will be the last day, they'll be testing us then. I've been tired all week, and it may be because of the class...  I'm downloading X TV. I want to see the series...  so tired... gotta wash the dishes still... *sigh*  -ArVi was just thinking........  Boo-chan, r u Catholic? hm.......  "By the Gods, I...."  should  b, "by the gods!"  plural , gods? yes, "Gods" iieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee  sorry, im just  really  boreD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! speaking of God...im supposed to b studying religion...*whines*  nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo    *sniffles*  ja ne......  HoSHi*Kawaii!     oooo... that emoticon = kawaii-ness, I can just see the glow around you two ^-^b   Anyhows, if I knew you were supposed to work on Geo... I would've dragged you out of the com lab... ah... you can get the Guidance thingy some other time.. it's not often that people teach you how to fall ^^;;; IMO, that self-defense thingy they teach us is turning out better than I thought...   Now that I've confused people with my brief dose of non-sensical-ness and weirdness, I will go poof now... *poof*   ~Chronos...till the end of TimeNew, but... is it improved?      Ha, anyway... ya...  TODAY was tiring...  I wasted the first two periods when I  should  have worked on Geo... The third period I used to walk around the school in search of people before sitting in english and doodling. Fourth Period I was  supposed  to go to a Guidence Appointment, but I realised I messed up my schedual and it was actually supposed to be fifth, but I missed it because at fifth I was a Gym Conflict Resolution Seminar with these guys who were teaching us  Budo  The way of the Warrior... They taught us how to fall and how to flip someone who grabbed our wrist.  As I mentioned in my last post... Last night I got a haircut... and yes... it is short... really... really short... Am I bald? No, not that short... but  much  shorter than it was, or should be!!!  meh  at least I can gel it.  WTF??? My dad just told me he wants me to vacuum. By the Gods, I vacuumed 2 days ago! What, he wants me to vacuum everyday??? *sigh* Tomllow. I refuse to vacuum till tomollow at least.  *sigh*  meh   -ArVoooo haircut eh?? cant wait to see it! i bet they made u bald!  *HEEHEE HE ehe eh ehe eh eheehrefhkef  ahh sorry im going crazy...itz prob the cold..and the fact that i stayedup reallly late last nit   *looks around* these dang gloves.. l8z!I got a haircut...    It's short...  -ArVArgh!!!    My computer crashes whenever it leaves or refreshes when on a page with embedded audio!!! >.  Anyone know how to solve? Would be greatful for  any  help.  -ArVPH34R!!     MUHAHAHAHA!! I have hacked into Keane's blogger and am now writing in it!!   Anyways... let's see what I should put...:     ok, keane gave me permission to work in his blogger  i have a blogger too, except that it's in shambles and it has nothing in it (seriously)  um... the above-mentioned page is like my aa page which does not work either...  ha! while you (keane) were having trouble with you're japanese exam, i breezed through my mandarin one!  ah... i will not waste more of your precious space...    Till next time! *disappears in the form of many bats*   P.S. yo keane... i think i just completely villified your blogger... ^^;;;I was really tired when I posted my last message...    But now that I've had 10 hours sleep, I'm even  more  tired for some reason. >.  Well how do people like the new colours? Rei-chan chosed them ^^; I think I'll have the change the orange font to something else though... hmm...  *yawns* Well, ja!  -ArVSo we took the Japanese mid-term exam today...    I guess it was hard... but if you actually listened to the teacher and studied what she asked you to, it should be a piece of cake.  Unfortunately, although I listen to the teacher, I am not to adept at studying.  Thus, I am quite good at grammer, but am horrible at vocabulary. -.-* *sigh*  Afterwards, I went to Rei-chan's house! ^-^ Yaay! Watched movies with Rei-chan and Mishi... um...   Austin Powers in Goldmember  Half of Monsters Inc.  Half of Ice Age  Three Quarters of Scooby Doo  And the first half of Rush Hour 2    I fell asleep during Scooby Doo... saw it many,  many  times (on account of my sisters' obsession to overwatch movies), and I was  soooo  tired.  -.-   My sister bought a bunch of 3D Puzzles ( P uzz 3 D is the brand name...) and she's currently working on an Aircraft Carrier. The  USS Nimitz . I was helping earlier... but I think a lot of the pieces are missing - She got the puzzles used...  What else happened today... it was kind of busy... Oh yes... Now I'll talk about school!   Yes, I know, I'm not writing chronologically...  *blinks* And I'm using a lot of italics.  Woke up at 8.30 am. Which isn't good since school starts at 8.30 and it takes an hour and a half to bus there. After a quick, and I mean  quick  shower my dad dropped me off 45 minutes late. Good thing Mine-sensei didn't start the exam until 9.30. -.-   We had the test during first period... fun. During the break I played speed Go with Von. She says I won, so does Chronos. I disagree. While we were playing I could hear people around me murmuring "Chinese Checkers." Geez people! It's Chinese  Chess !!!! Wei-chi Chess to be exact... but we play by Japanese rules. ^-^  Second period the teacher taught us out of the text book. It's actually quite good for grammer. When school finished, I had to  shamefully  ask Rei-chan to pick me up so I could go to her house. -.-* But it was worth it, even just to see Rei-chan but 3 days early!  Oh yes! Rei-chan's coming to Mary Ward on Wednesday with Jade! That'll be interesting...  Well, until next time! Oyasumi Nasai!  -ArVAlright    I'll be waiting... and I always believed that you shouldn't study the night before a test.  -ArVohh myyyy baddd i just dun listen to the radio very often...and i never said "twiddle" was grammatically coorectt....:P i was just saying ive never heard of it..ne wayz instead of going on dis blogger shouldnt ub studying?? tsk tsk tsk..hey im gonna phone @ 6:30 or 7, is dat okie?Ohhhh....    That's not Spider-Man, it's the radio commercial for McDonalds! lolOf course...    It's like a message board!  This computer doesn't have Messenger so I can't go on it, but Spider-Man quote? *blinks*  I'm pretty sure "twiddle" is a grammatically correct word. And don't worry about stealing code... that's how I started learning HTML.  *evil grin*  Actually I think that's how most people start into HTML... unless they read a book about it.  Study early? *blinks* too late now...  -ArVheys~ No worries Boo-chan im sure ull do fine ^-^ heys how come ur posting but u..u..dont go online? *sniff* and oh aout that comments thing, i think itz gonna b awhile till they let ne new members join...soooo im gonna phone kaz and ask him if he can help out ^-^ once i had it u can have one too, btw i hope u dun mind if i continue to take a few of ur stuff so i can get the same things ^^ but then again i dun feel very original...ur site IS cool! and watz wid quoting from spider man? lol...wat happened to austin powers? u should study early THEN sleep early...baka...btw i never knew there was such a word as "twidles" and r u alrit wid this being a way 4 us to communcate? hmm maybe is hould jsut use the phone....lol....Japanese mid-term exam is tomorrow...    *sigh* and I'm nowhere near ready for it... -.-*   Parker you've got style, you've got Moxy!   Gee thanks Mr. Johnson!   And you've got one of those McDonald's Chicken Flatbreads! Let's have a look at that!   I believe, what we're all thinking is...  What's  Moxy ?   I'm so tired... I dont know why... I was like this all day... -.-* Maybe I should sleep early... But I have to study... this'll be a canundrum...  -ArVAh don't worry...    I  did  make a new template but only the old one showed up at the computer at school... Strangest thing...  I like this template... I'm wondering how much I can do to make it my own...  *sigh* That site with the comments thing is still not allowing people to sign up... *twiddles thumbs* I guess I'll have to wait. *sniff*  *blinks* Wow... I actually  did  sniff... must be the weather.  -ArVu did change ur template...not unless ur template is no longer the latest one ive seen ^-^'' *eh heh and sorry if u dun like me posting here! btw! i stole ur sum stuff from ur template *snickers* and made my own "recomended links" sugoi!Strangest thing...    I could have  sworn  that I changed my template... why is it the old one again?  -ArV^-^ Sugoi!  Team thing-e worked!  Sugoi!  -ArVWatch! Seee "Ar Vs" g/f *snickers* i know all his secrets!! *laguhs evily*I've noticed...    That the most common thing said on internet journals is   "It's been a long time since I updated."     It seems to fit this occassion... so... It's been a long time since I updated!  I added quiz results on left side... same results as Rei. *blinks*  Rei'chan-s coming on Wednesday! Sugoi!!!  On a lower note... I couldn't go snow tubing today... -.-*  On an even  lower  note, I have midterm exam on Saturday! Japonaise... *sigh*   meh  Wish me luck!  -ArVFoods and Shows     Ah, last night was International Night. Unfortunately, I was too busy running around the place the enjoy ^^;; ah well. Our pavilion (japanese) seemed to be quite ok, thought we cleared out of food very quickly, many times.    As for the show... besides the little timing problem we had, I think it was ok ^^;; need to get Trisha to send me the video clip *grins*   Don't feel like writing that much... did everyone else just give up on their blogs? And why is nobody online? (Actually there are many people, but still!)   ~ChronosUgh.. Horrible day...    Had a TA interview... ugh...  Took a WHOLE HOUR... UGH...  He's making me drop my favourite subject!!!! UGGHHH -.-...  Backblog error? ugh...  Fellytone no work... UGH...  o.o... wait a minute... no...  Fellytone no work.... UGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH...  *sigh*  -ArVHappy two-month...    Too bad my phone no work so I can't call you... :'(  -ArVwhoa, not many people posting ne thing up here........  *pretends she is Boo-chan*  Happy 2 month anniversary Rei-chan!!!!  *herself*  *flutters eye lashes* OH! ^-^ y thk u! same to u!  *coughs and get bak on track*   yes....yes.......i kno im weird.....  Hoshi*Books and more Snow     Ahh... either you guys are spending more time offline or I am. Or both.    Yesterday was interesting, went to Keane's house to practise some kendo.. it was a cheap imitation of the actual bamboo sword they use, plus we were just practising... but somehow I got slightly hurt ...*glares at von* ah well... pretty fun, even though we didn't get that much done.   Finish The Song of the Lionness quartet... I think I fell asleep while reading till very late... parents must've been wondering why the lights was still on in the morning... and why I was wearing my glasses... ^^;;    Course selection soon... I can't escape it, my dad is forcing me to take all 3 sciences even though the smart people at my school advise against it... --;; watch me fail and my parents blame it on my slackness.    Eheh, church was so empty today... must've been the snowstorm...   That's about all.. seems like I'm forgetting something.. ah, homework! Haven't done that in awhile.. must start soon... ja!   ~ChronosSnowscapes and Starlight     I hope I did well in the Waterloo contest... I know my parents would really be disappointed if I didn't...*looks around* I'm quite sure I won't do as well as last year... *groans* last year I placed first and got 128....    On to more cheerful news, International Night is coming... origami and kendo practises are needed! Hopefully, we can try to not make a fools of ourselves on stage.   Yesterday I went from 8pm to 4am reading "Alanna: the First Adventure" and "Wind in the Door". Ehheh... ^^;; gomen hoshi-chan.. it was just that it was... so... interesting.   Ah... just went outside to get something (mailperson put an envelope for my sister in my neighbour's mailbox instead)... noticed how clear the stars are from where I am, even though there's still quite a bit of light pollution. The snow and the stars look really nice at night... heck, what other time are you supposed to see stars? ^^;; welll, let's all decide to try to catch up, if I ever get there... I'll try to pull you ahead with me keane... until then... I must prevent myself from drowning... gomen.. no position to help anyone...yet.   Ah... tomorrow is my  urlLink site's  first official anniversary. I used a different background just to celebrate it!    ~ChronosOut of bandwidth...    I wont be able to go online much... or download much in the next week, as the title might imply what happened, I've exceeded my bandwidth limit...  Please, let me explain a little something about Sympatico (my ISP), the service I was given allows me to upload and download 10 GB roughly everymonth. Now, since it's  unlimited  Internet, they're not going to cut your internet off if you keep downloading, but they instead charge you  a lot  every Gigabyte you download/upload over the limit.  Ah, well, fine... I've downloaded too much CSI this month... heh... and I've been online a lot... but I can resist the computer for the next week or so! The next month starts on February 26th so it's not that long... just... seven... days away... -.-* ugh... I just hope my sister wont be Instant Messaging too much on MSN...     I know that for every character I type, I'll be uploading another byte, and downloading it at least twice... but I feel obliged to type what happened on Monday! Too bad I don't remember... -.-  But today... Ugh.. I decided that I should start working... TRYING TO CATCH UP. *tired, yet happy face*  *shrugs* I guess I should leave it at that! All you guys know my number if something important comes up.  -ArVChoices and Decisions     Let'see... main things that happened today... got TWO units done... (count 'em... TWO - cause for celebration *wastes rest of week* crap.. there goes all my hard work...)   Ehheh... hopefully that won't happen... but  anyways ... the second thing that was quite interesting that happened today was that the number of people helping out for the japanese pavilion just tripled...where did all these people come from? ^^;; More people... more PAWA....so oh well.   Well.. last thing was course selection... and do i have a lot to go through or what... ah well, the top 5 right now are: the 3 sciences, Computers, and Media Arts. Media Arts being the funnest.   Ah.. hafta go to library... Song of the Lionness awaits..^^;; and so does "The Swiftly Tilting Planet".     *Later that day*     I must be really messed up these days... when I got my shoes to go to the library... I picked up  dress  shoes... then i was like "what the heck am I doing?".. and just yesterday.. after taking a shower, it was cold and I wanted to wear a sweater... I wore a sweater and it wasn't till I went to bed that I found out I was wearing my school uniform sweater... I was like "wha...?" and no one seemed to notice either.. maybe we're all tired and messed.   Ah... did I say Swiftly Tilting Planet? I meant Wind in the Door...^^;; The second book in the series in any case...spent most of the night reading the first book of Song of the Lionness... really interesting so far. Seems like a hybrid of Mulan and Sword in the Stone.    ~ChronosUgh...    I wrote a blog twice... They were good blogs too...   My blogs were deleted... twice... so... Tooo tired to write anodder... -.- ugh...  -ArVConcentration and Consequences     Ike.... I just found out today I lost the piano-flute music sheet I was supposed to practise... I'm going to ask for another one, and hope I don't get in too much trouble... -.-;;   Ah, and then I found out that "hey, I have to get all of History Day research done by this Friday and I barely started" and "ooo... I have 43 out of 80 units done... soon to be out of 88 if it isn't already..." and "my site is supposed to launch March 3rd and we're not close to being ready!!" and "omg... just noticed that my sister's and mom's bdays are coming soon, what the heck am I supposed to do?" and "I am so behind~! WAH!!" and "why am I talking to myself?" and "I tired and flooded..." and "mustn't procrastinate any longer..."   And so on.   Well, anyways, despite all that, let's continue: to keane - day's event eh? Are you going to put in the time where you cruelly got everyone worried about you? =.= ... to renae - ah... i see you got those comment thingies now, coolz... to vics - sounds like quite an eventful day... and how the heck can you concentrate on work?? I need that kind of concentration!   ~ChronosI fixed it! ^-^      I fixed your site :P  Last time I asked if you wanted me to add the comment thingy you said you wanted to do it yourself  Why would you give up? I found a template that would be cool, it has fire!!! ^-^    Ah... g2g... will post day's events later...  -ArV*cries* me site dissapeared!!!!!!!!!*clears throat* Boo-chan...what happened to my site...you said ud fix it long time ago...*cries* *sniffles* guess u kno care....*cries* *heehee jkz jkz, dun hafta do ne thing...when the cable's bac ill just hafta try again...>.   Hoshi*Sugoi!    After yeeears of searching, (actually one boring Friday) I have suceeded in finding a site that'll let me store pictures for my blogger! For free (actually it's part of my ISP so technically my parents were already paying for it). Eh heh... ^-^  That means I have more room to customize my site and I can use images now!  -ArVIce and Quartets (but not necessarily in that order)     Ah... yesterday I finally got the first book of the Immortals (lucky for me it came in order... Wild Magic - I just finished reading...). Unfortunately, the quartets are all related to each other...  therefore ... i just spoiled the first quartet for myself... fun. Why didn't anyone tell me?? Ah well... *cancels all Immortal holds and places ones on Song of Lionness* excellent..done. Hopefully, they come in the right order..^^;;   Ah... skating was good today, the usual skating around in circles, and talking.   Sat school was pretty interesting too.. we had to split the class into two, and i went with the group that stuck with the assistant teacher. The assistant teacher was nice and let us do whatever. I practised self-defence with some people from my home school...^^;; got thrown to the ground a few times...eh...heh...ah, well, it was fun. Breaktime was fun too, ne?   ah, that's bout all...happy whatever-that's-coming-up-let's-just-say-international-night.   ~Chronosconfused and puzzled (confuzzled)     Yikes... did i really make those mistakes? Never again! At least not for this post.. ^^;;   Ah... Happy Valentines Day to everyone that celebrates! Ah... and my sister just arrived... that means.. no computer for me for awhile...^^;; I'm guessing she'll be wanting the computer a lot... ah well, need to cut back on net anyways.   ~ChronosYunno...    Watching  Solitaire  throw cards with the R.O.D. theme playing in the background is strangely satisfying...  -ArVKeane... no know HTML?     hits self on head   I just put <i> instead of </i> >.  hopes em wont hit me  eh heh...  -ArV  (After post...) Ugh... I just did it again...Never stand...    ...infront of me when I cough...   looks at phlegm on floor I just coughed up...   ewwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww  -ArVEm... no know HTML?    Em... to close an italics tag you type  </i>  not  <i> .  tsk tsk tsk... had to edit your post... *shakes head sadly*  Ugh... anyway... at home...  again . Got some rest... enough? Not sure...  Saw X episode 0. I liked that episode better than episode 24.  Playing with... sl¦¡|¦¡|¦¡|¦¡|¦¡|¦¡|¦¡|¦¡|¦¡|¦¡|¦¡|nky.  ^-^  -ArVReading and Writing     Today was an interesting day... for once, I actually did productive things for the entire day (kinda). First period, I went to play some piano... turns out I'm kinda rusty-ish...^^;; which is expected, but I guess I can improve with practise... plus never played duet before. Let'see... second period I spent studying for my science test... must've asked like 5 different people about the test, took the test in 3rd, and found out that people weren't lying when they said it was easy. Fourth and fifth I spent working on my Computer Engineering Course, FINALLY managed to get the stupid printer networked... that got us stumped for like an entire period yesterday.    Ah... I fear for my safety... TA interview tomorrow ... I'll try to get it postponed... ^^;;   After school, we had Anime Society, and as a Valentine special, we watched Karekano... I liked it, even though I usually hate storylines fully based on romance. It was definitely better than Boys Be, though one member of Anime Society disagrees...meh, hope we get back to Gundam Seed, Wolf's Rain, and Scryed. Now, I'm back home and ready to work some more... che sera sera... I won't worry too much bout my TA interview right now...^^;;   ~ChronosThird day in a row...    ...that I'm stuck at home... -.-  Well, I saw the last episode of X last night... actually kind of disappointing. A few reviews I read said that manga was better, and the movie had a bad storyline... Maybe I could ask Maureen for the manga...  -ArVBeing sick sucks...    I was stuck at home again... but I'll be going to the doctor soon... -.-* I think the appointment is at 4.30...  -ArVPlanning and Toiling     Woot! Actually got ONE unit done today!! *feels special* eh heh... anyhows, hope you get better soon K-kun. You missed the japanese pavilion meeting *glares* ... we decided to use home-made shinais for sparring and put up 2 of the swords as display. Mrs.Small offered some bamboo... which is perfect. You couldn't find origami paper at Pacific Mall???? wtfruit??? I was informed by 2 different people that there IS origami paper there... *suspicious* methinks you spent your time elsewhere...   Anyhows... I will not verbally bash you much more...since you're sick...^^;; ahh... what else what else... oh, it's been strange lately... unexpected things happen... ah well   As I said... I WILL be working harder this month... and I suggest we all work hard! MUHAHAHA!! WORKWORKWORK!! *grumbles* wasted first 3 periods doing not much... *sigh* at least using 4th and 5th I was able to finish one unit.   That bout all? umm... guess so. Later! (btw, I got cut from badminton... woohoo! eh...heh...)   ~ChronosUgh... Sick    Stayed at home... sick... sleeping... -.-*  -ArVExplanations...    Okay... it was birthday beats. I  had  to punch you! It's the law! *evil smile*  Also... the reason you have to use HTML Tags in my blog and not in yours is because I made it like that :P gomen, I prefer it that way.  -ArVWorking and...Laughing??     Lighten up Hoshi-chan... ^^;;... you could consider the situation funny...^^;; ooo... take a look at this:  urlLink "Boo's Blog"..LOL  and  urlLink some pretty funny articles    Anyhows, I won't be on messenger on that often... at least not until I finish everything I need to finish... which...might...take... awhile... but meh! I'll be with you guys in spirit! Hopefully... if I disappear for like a month or two... you guys won't forget me...^^;; then again... it might be hard to get rid of me... I'll still go on messenger sometimes (Keane... if I'm on often... punch me... *GLARES* you seemed to have fun doing that today)    ~Chronos*glares at keane*.....=-= u did NOT say ud b studying...u DID say ud b sleeping...SO i assumed! that that meant u would b home......*looks left, then right* i forgot u had school...ok?demmoooo u didnt mention it! *folds arms* u didnt say ne thing about studying..*gasps* how dare u lie...=P lol ooo well..*looks at time* *looks at messanger* *pouts* no one's online, and y should i put p's to make lines????   datz insanity! i dun hafta do that for my blog >P BTW EPS @$ IS DONE! *waves banner in air* ooo today wasnt the best of dayz..check out my blog to find out...:) jaThoughts and Reflections     Let'see, yesterday was an interesting day... had a bday party! My bday is actually today... most people comment on how I can drive now... but for me, more importantly is the fact that I can take NLS (lifeguarding course) now ^^;;    Ahh... basically, everyone split up and did their own thing yesterday... ^^;; something tells me that's not exactly very party-ish, ehheh... so... i need you people to tell me what I could've done better. Here are some things I thought of already:     The host could've paid more attention to the guests        The party could've been more interesting        There should've been more planning    I'm sure there is much more to that list... but can't think of any right now.   Present-wise... welll, the best present I guess... is just having everyone there ^^;; Thanx to everyone for being there (and of course your pressies ^-~)!   Ahh... itz aite with me if you stay late... but my parents are probably less enthusiastic about it... ^^;; I guess that's bout it...   ~ChronosWell use BR tags =P    If you put  br  or  p  in front of each line (inside of the triangle brackets of course) it'll make a new line or two.  Meh, can't stay long... late... Emerson's birthday party. Happy Birthday to you *looks at watch* Yep. And I said Happy Birthday to Von as her birthday was um... Sunday (today? yesterday?)   *looks around*  Actually I  did  sleep in, but I got to school in time anyhow. ^-^... and gomen ne... I didn't  exactly  forget I had school...  I remembered I had school, and I tried planning it so it'd be after school... Demo... I thought school ended half an hour earlier than it actually does. And... you can note that when you talked to me, I said "You can call when I'm studying, or sleeping." Now... I know in Canada, studying means you're at home... er... studying... but I guess I picked up the filipino inuendo that when you're at school, you say you're studying... ah... gomen ne...  OOOOHHhhh... Almost forgot... how could I forget... *bows to em* sooooo sooorry for staying sooooo late... *bows*  Well, g'night.  -ArVYestereve and Present     Gomen... ^^;; not my fault our school (and my old school) has Activity Day). Eh heh... I know what you mean... I thought Keane "slept in" again this week, since I didn't see him in the morning. As for paragraphs... surely you know some HTML ne? Use open-caret - p - close-caret, carets being those triangly brackets above the comma and period.   Anyhows, yesterday was pretty fun, after duelling a bit, I went skating then came back home to play Warcraft (with Eric laughing at my n00bism).    And today... should be interesting... unfortunately I forgot to reconfirm with 4 people... ^^;; they better come anyways *glares*. Ah... a new low: 2 people on messenger out of 50-something?? wtfruit..? Ah wellll...   ~Chronos*clears throat* ait Chronos...ur hurting me...>Shots and... Shots       Welll... today was an interesting day. It was no ordinary day... it was activity day (yay...)     It actually went pretty well, first, we went to Laser Quest. Being my first time there, I was confused. Well...not really. It was pretty straight-forward: shoot people with laser. On the first game, I placed 17 out of 23, then the second, I placed 10 out of 24. Eh heh, I'm just happy that I'm not last. A surprising thing is... i had a 90% hit-miss ratio... oo;; which means that for every 10 shots I took, I got nine... weird, cause I thought I missed more than that. It was a pretty fun experience ^^;;     After that, we went to Putting Edge for lunch (which was 2 slices of pizza and unlimited drinks), and played mini-golf... Keane remembers mini-golf, ne? ^^;; Out of the 4 people I played with, I scored the best... like 3 under par or something like that.      Ah... when we got back, I waited for half an hour for the Playdium people (and Keane) to come back... waited for like half an hour, and watched as the rock-climbing people and the skating people return... then I was like  meh  and left. When I got off at Finch, I saw the schoolbus carrying Playdium people back to school... what irony...^^;;     Ah well, good day altogether, hope you had fun today snow-tubing! (*glares* you  better  have had fun...)   ~Chronosum........ah.........waa happened to ur blogspot? it looks pretty messed up...*blinks* oooo snowtubing...we dun get previlages like dat......Ugh... Snowtubing...    Today is a break day for me... well, it's supposed to be an exam day where you only go to school if you have an exam or a test. I dont have any tests to do, and my exam... well, I'll take the late exam. -.-*  According to the VP those who don't have tests or exams should go home and make sure they're on track. HA! Like that'll ever happen. I was invited to the movies, but I doubt I'll be allowed to go out three times in one week...  Ah yes, Sunday is Emerson's birthday party! (#1) That'll be fun! *puts on glasses and smiles evilly* Or will it?  So, on Saturday I will be going with Von and Rei to mall to get gift! (#2) That still hasn't been planned properly yet... And there'll have to be some stuff bought for international night...  *goes back one step* Yes, so you see why if I went out with friends today, it'd be three times this week. Meh... at least I get to stay home and... *blinks* Vacuum??? *sigh* lol  I'll watch X! ^-^ I might be able to finish the series... and if Angelfire is friendly today I might be able to upload episode 23 for Maureen.  Well, off to finish vacuuming! Ja ne!  -ArV    Changed the links on the left side so that they'll open in a new window.  Thinking of playing with the colours... White seems very bright, either that or my eyes are extra sensitivte today...*blinks* 8 straight?!?! LUCKY U? were washroom break involved......? ^-~ ne wayz i think u should catch up on rest on ur day off, ashiteru Boo-chan, make SURE the next time im talking to u on the phone that ur not half dead for exhuastion......  um...i only..have..eps...24....to watch  the manga is like......so MUCH more detailed!!!!!!! er.....Arashi and Sorata have a so much better relationship! like the plot builds up SO much better...plz.....sum1 tell me WHY the confined the beauty of X/1999 into 24 eps.....?  argh....u.u things seems to b brining me down more....i must....get up....*climbs* ooooo u wont let me get down! noo school u wont! noo not time away from boo u wont!   *thinks* *rocks bac and forth* itz almost the weekened...itz almost the weekend...  *stomach grumbles* er.........  Hoshi*Four hours... Ugh    I just watched 8 straight episodes of X/1999.  It's fun to watch.. but I think that'll be all for tonight. I knows my limit!!! Well, kind of...  So tired...  -ArVRain and War     oooo.... a Goban! I hope your sisters are good Go players... ^^;; Anyhows, I got beaten fairly badly at badminton today... lost 13-0 ^^;; (Joe!! You shall pay!!), didn't feel tired out until later...    I'm probably going to stay off messenger for this week... since my dad has been getting angrier and angrier each time he sees me on messenger... need...to...change...skin... of ... messenger... to...disguise... oh, and just found out that hoshi-chan would be off messenger for this week too... interesting coincidence... it's supposed to be some sort of test of self-discipline for her... ^^;;    I went to the library today... first time in a long time... had to, cause History Day Consultation #2 calls for internet AND book AND newspaper/magazine.... yeesh... these teacher nowadays want so much... *shakes head* ah well, borrowed some interesting books: like  The Art of War  and other war strategy books. On the way back, it was raining freezing rain... slippery for cars... hopefully there won't be any accidents.   ~Chronos*Wipes Sweat off Brow*    I got them back... phew... Even though I'm not playing at my best today... Guess I'm still tired for some reason... >.  Oh, and my sister got me a Goban... well not really... it's 9x9... it's Green, Hard Plastic and it folds in half... I think it's used... there are no pieces though mine should fit. It would be difficult to place stones on the edges though because they are raised...  -ArVAw this sucks...    I was playing Hikaru No Go GBA ROM and I actually won! And I got extra stuff! (A Hikaru plushie on the bed, and a poster on the door) but I accidentally pressed F1 and it loaded a previously saved game and deleted all my scores... *sigh*  meh   -ArVNow all I need to do is watch them...    X has finished downloading!!! So has CSI 1x01!  ^-^ Sugoi!   Maybe I should watch them later though... damn dirty dishes...   Oh yah.. and I want to check how much I downloaded this month but I can't find my phone number and password sheet... -.-U *sigh*   -ArVFloods and Fires     Let's start with the flood first, flood of events that is: chinese new year, bday, international night, art show, school units, volunteer (x2), website, book editing, badminton, and hopefully anime con. I know it's not much, but still!! (I'll explain some of them in depth later if I feel like it afterwards, MUHAHAHA!!! COMPLETE PAWA!!!)   Now the fire, some idiot tried to set my sister's building on fire... *mutters* these 3vil p3opl3...and unfortunately, there had been so many bluffs with the fire alarm, most people living in that residence thought it was another one. Luckily, my sister and some other girl found out there was a real fire, and warned everyone in time. *sigh* some people have too much time on their hands, either that... or..or... something...   ONLY 91%??!! Are you mocking me? That's what I got!! But then again, I was like "only 91%" too... ^^;; ... Ah yes, the space shuttle incident...I first heard of it - not on the news - but on  urlLink Megatokyo    Oh, and hope you and hoshi had fun today ^-~   Ok, I don't really feel like explaining those things in the first paragraph, ask me if you're interested... back to work I go...   ~ChronosReport Card!!!    We got our report cards in Japanese class today!  I only got 91% -.-*  On a related note, I thought I came late today... turns out I was half an hour early...eh heh...  Unfortunately, today is a day of mourning in the USA. The space shuttle Columbia blew up over Texas. Seven astronauts died. My prayers go to them.  -ArVIRAQ and QARI     Let'see, first Iraq...you guys MUST read Linwood Barclay's columns in Toronto Star... he's an amazing columnist, lol, I don't get Toronto Star anymore, but my sister came home for the weekend, and she brought Thursday and Friday's newspaper with her... Anyways, he was saying how since American businessmen were afraid of stocks going down of the war, and how this Iraqi was saying how that is a concern, and plans to become defeated as quickly as possible to protect their portfolios... then offhandedly mentions "oh look, there goes my living room". Then Linwood ends off saying "glad to know that there are people halfway around the world who care about us".   Oh... i also heard there's a bunch of civilian casualities so far, and that the war is going to go on for quite a while. Well, as long as it doesn't hurt the economy, ne?   As the war goes on, we have our own problem to deal with... QARI! Quite Acute Respiratory Illness is spreading around and killing and infecting and such... half our Saturday class decided to be absent either   a) their parents were afraid of QARI hurting them, and wanted to keep them home b) an excuse to skip   oh ... that reminds me... it's actually SARS for those that have been hibernating. I just thought that QARI would make a more fitting name   ~ChronosUgh This Sucks...    I  knew  I should've just posted... I tried to make a comment for Renae's last post but it was too long and it didn't post. -.-*  Let me see if I can paraphrase it here...  Not all wars are stupid. There are just reasons to go to war. They were given to us by St. Augustin, a Christian philospher.  ~There has to be a just reason to go to war. (Defending oneself, or an ally. Preserving the peace)  ~The war has to be approved of by a lawfull authority. (The only lawful authority that has control in multiple nations is the UN)  ~The war must be for the betterment of mankind. (ie. Taking out Hitler so he doesn't cause more pain, suffering, useless deaths. Or the American Revolution which liberated the USA from England gave birth to democracy)  Although Mr. Bush would like us to believe otherwise, this war isn't a just war. The reasons for his war are oil. And no matter what he tells the U.N. or the rest of the world, that always was and always will be his reason.  As for us paying attention to the war. The reason we watch the war so closely is because  we  may be pulled into the war at any time. Someone may attack Continental USA, which we are so close to. Other countries may decide to join the war and soon may escalate to the third World War. The UN might decide to allow this war and Canada would go to war.  Either either, this war may affect us and change our lives at any time. That's why people pay so much attention to it!  -ArV*stomps foot on ground* All I hear about everywhere is this "WAR". Yes, I beliebe we are all aware of it....demo, wat can WE do? All these poloticians and leaders and coporations in charge of OUR lives, well well, then wat can we do? Sure Sure...let's make it our daily subject *mumbles* Ah, but i do see the seriousness in this...but let's just face the facts, we're not a part of this game. Meh, I dunno, im just going along like i normally do, i got one thing to say tho: STUPID! STUPID! STUPID! THIS WAR IS STUPID! SO IS  NE WAR  THAT TAKES PLACE *breaths* ja! ^-^2 Units a day? Anime!     I am very close to my goal of 2 units a day. If I keep to this pace, I can dig myself out of this hole, ^^   Anyways, today, we had Anime... saw Slayers. Kinda interesting, but the plot was so similar to many other plots.  Indeed... war on iraq has started... changes will appear, for better of for worse.   ~ChronosStayed Home...    I was too tired to go to school today...  News says USA started attack on Iraq.  God save us all.  -ArVA Stitch In Death    Broke a cup... Cut my hand... Went to Hospital... Got stitches... Can't type properly... G'night...  -ArVOwwie...    *squishes face together* my tummy huyts...  -ArV*Pout*    It didn't show up...  -ArVCold, Wet, and Dirty...    Okay... so I'm not wet... but It's kinda cold...  I woke up and my grandmother wanted me to go with her to a Church downtown... I weasled out of it by promising to go to one on Saturday...  I'm sorry... but I don't like being asked to go somewhere the moment I wake up... especially if they tell me to be ready within the next 30 minutes...  Rei-chan was ova yesterday! ^-^ Almost beat Sonic the hedgehog together... stupid Metropolis crabs... grr...  Uhhhmmmm.... I'm really posting this because I want to see if my blog will show up as one of the ten most recently updated blogs on blogger.com! If it does I'll upload a screenshot.  Demo... what happened to my comment thing-e? Why it gone? *sigh* Meh...  -ArVVolunteering and Boredom     Firstly, I got the results for the rest of the people that went to the tournament: Clarence won the tournament, Philip got beaten second round by an Exodia-deck user (Clarence beat that guy 3rd round), and Daniel got knocked out in some round. Eric got what he came for... the only card he needed and wanted...finally found someone willing to sell.   Went to the daycare at 9:00am today, unexpectedly stayed till 2:00pm. Mostly just hung around watching how things are done. The kids had free time, went outside, played some games, sang some songs, and then half went tobogganning and half stayed for archery. I went with the tobogganning group since the park is near my house, and it was nearing 2:00pm. Pretty interesting, I actually talked more to the other counsellors than I did last year. Though still not much.    Came back home and wasted the rest of the day, need to finish unit before I sleep though. I finished one math unit yesterday... yay for me ^^;;    Ah... will volunteer 9 - 2 again tomorrow, then I'll have my 10 hours from the daycare. My total is 31 hours and counting ^^b   ~ChronosBlood and Duels     The weekend was fairly eventful... some of the things that happened was the dentist got my mouth all bloody, went to some restaurant for my mom's birthday, some friends came over to duel and prepare for todays tournament. Also, I was practising "First Love" on the piano a bit. It's a simplified version... doesn't sound as good as the actual song. Oh well.   Anyways, today was interesting. I lost first round. So far, I know how two of my other friends did. Aaron got knocked second round by Eric. Eric got knocked 3rd round by the same guy that beat me. Clarence made it to the finals, but don't know if he won.   Umm... as for going on Thursday, I think that I'll probably be able to go. Probably as in not 100% sure yet... my parents can change their mind very easily... oh, that reminds me. I'll probably be off messenger for the rest of the month.    Ahh... just came back home from volunteering for Spelling Bee. Quite interesting. Not that bad.    If you're wondering why I'm typing in short sentences, it's cause I'm annoyed. I'm just annoyed cause there are annoying people in the house, who can't seem to quiet down. Since there hasn't been any visitors today, and my sister is at university, I'm sure you guys are smart enough to use the process of elimination. From now on, I'll have to rely on the phone as my main source of communication. Ja   ~ChronosThree Units a Day???    I'll seriously try my best... and I'll even try to finish e-v-e-r-y unit I brought home for March Break, but frankly Joe... you're cwazeeeee....  Ugh... Joe's Blogger wont let him update his Template for some reason, and although I was originally going to change my template, I guess that can wait for another time...  Umm... I can't really think of much more to put... *thinks* *shrugs* If I think of anything I'll come back...  when I have time ... -.-*  Oh yah... You're not supposed to eat meat on Ash Wednesday... or on Friday's of lent... I had hotdogs on Wednesday... and Chicken today... does fowl count as meat?  -ArVAshes to Ashes     Our T.A. rep handled the ceremony for us. She didn't go to the training. She went giggly tracing ashes over people's forehead. oo;; ah wellll... let'see, this OAC was talking about the pointlessness of all this.. the ceremony.. the church.. personally i agreed that all the ceremonies and symbols were pointless... but it didn't seem right to voice it out in a catholic school ^^;;   Hotdogs are good... what have you against hotdogs? oo;; i got sandwich for lunch... and 2 boxes of juice... now there's a surprise... ^^;; eh..heh...   Finished reading the Immortals series... if only I have such dedication to my schoolwork as I do to the quartets...^^;;   There are other things, but oh well, don't feel like typing anymore   ~ChronosIt's Ash Wednesday...    And my dad gave me hotdogs for lunch... o.oU  -ArVJoe and I were playing    ...punch for punch again... and OW does my hand hurt...  And today's the official opening of NandaPanda Website! Though we don't really have anything up right now... and Emerson doesn't want me to do website work for the next three months... >.  -ArV....y would u two need to share the same room? *glares* *coughs* ne wayz, welcome joe! demo, this is Boo-chan's blog, so i dunno if it's right for me to say "welcome" ne wayz...u guys' blog is ten times better than mine,  specially cause it's never updated u.u...oh well, wat can u do? i have a feeling this is going to be a slowwwww dayyy ahh! gomen nasai Boo-chan for keeping u up so late! >.Stressful Day    I woke up late for Saturday school... I forgot a letter I was supposed to bring for Stanley to his teacher.  I called my parents, so they said that they'd bring it at 11.30... they were 15 minutes late...  Kyle came with us to Parkway Mall... I told him he couldn't come... he came anyway...  Emerson was there too... We left after class, but not before meeting Lynn and Renae at OCS.  ====notfinished====  Ugh... too tired to finish this tonight... maybe tomorrow...  -ArVHere's first official harvest from the veggie garden.  urlLink An All Season Burpless Cucumber.  I got my garden in a little late this year (early June) so I am just now getting some produce. I have harvested my basil twice, and used most of the herbs but this is my first real veggie. To honor it properly, I picked up some organic baby lettuce and button mushrooms from a local farmer's market and made a sweet little salad.    urlLink       In addition to the Burpless Cukes I grew 2 other kinds. A new hybrid called  urlLink Cucumber Diva , and a sweet heirloom,  urlLink Lemon Cucumber .    urlLink      urlLink        I have developed a small amount of  urlLink powdery mildew  on some of my cucumber plants, and more on my squash plants. I'm going to use my afternoon today off to try and  urlLink solve  this  urlLink problem , if it doesn't thunderstorm.I decided to make a little card to attach to all my gift knits, to let people know what they are made of and how to take care of them. So here is what I came up with. urlLink       I used a photo of the same yarn I used for the sweater, which I think really makes a nice touch. For future tags I will probably switch out the red yarn ball for the coordinating yarn for that project. I also attached a small bit of the yarn used in the sweater, to repair snags or rips if they happen to occur.    Here are a couple overall photos of the tag on the sweater, before it was wrapped. (Left photo: evening sunlight, right photo: morning sun, what a difference.)   urlLink      urlLink       I also found this very cute packaging at Target to wrap it all up in. By "wrap it all up" I mean simply wrapping the folded sweater in tissue paper and sticking it in the gift bag.  urlLink        I will find out tomorrow if they like it. My friend wanted to wait to open it until he was at home with his wife and they could "open it as a family". How cute :)Tonight is my  urlLink Stitch 'n Bitch , and I just finished the Phildar Baby Sweater so I need to get another project going. I have been wanting to make the Salt Peanuts cardigan from the spring issue of  urlLink Interweave Knits  for months (a present for my Mom's Birthday in September), and figured it's probably time to get started on that.     I ordered the yarn from  urlLink elann.com  literally months ago.  I got Austermann Biella in a deep green color, that's no longer available.    I swatched for this sweater a while back and I ended up having to go down to size 9 needles opposed to the 10.5 used in the pattern. I'm going to double check tonight before starting it, but I'm a loose knitter I guess.Well I seamed up the baby sweater and wove in all the pesky ends. Here's the finished sweater.    urlLink      I did a 3 needle bind off for the shoulders from live stitches I had kept on holders. The shoulder seams are nice and small. I used mattress stitch for woven seams everywhere else, and the seams are rather bulky for such a tiny item. In anyone has a better solution for joining sleeves and seaming for baby garments please share.    I ended up choosing this pattern after my first choice didn't pan out. I was originally going to make this sweet little sweater from  urlLink Debbie Bliss Easy Knits .       I ordered the Yarn from  urlLink elann.com .   Endless Summer Collection Lara, 326 Claret.   urlLink       Instead of starting with the sweater, I started with the matching booties. After I finished them, I wasn't very happy with them. They were very slow going on US 3s and the end result wasn't what I had in mind, so I was then in search of a new pattern. I looked in all my books, and looked around on the web and finally settled on the Phildar pattern. The only problem was the gauge was totally different, and I still wanted to use the yarn I had. So I had to double the yarn, and I did some gauge swatches and finally got gauge for the Phildar pattern. The knitted fabric is a little dense but I think it's perfect for a fall sweater.urlLink    I remember these restaurantsWhen you work with people for a good while, a bond grows between you and the others you work with. Often this bond resembles a family, even going so far as having people play certain roles.  We lost one of our best cashiers today at work. Jan had taken off 6 weeks for surgery, and apparently did some job searching while she was at it.  Understandably, she wanted to be closer to home, and she's always lived at least an hour's drive away.  The thing about Jan is that her customer service was top notch, plain and simple.  A toothy grin and inquisitive, "Hi, how are you?" for everybody, be they crotchety old man or haughty middle aged woman.  This departure sets us in a "moving on" mood, and as one employee was heard saying, "Heck of a way to start the year, eh?"  Today as the rain fell down and one of our family members departed for the last time, our smiles felt empty, and our greetings as hollow as a rotted out dogwood tree.Christmas was neat this year.  Why, you ask? Because of gifts and free food? No.  The big gift for the year was getting to see my uncle again, who has advanced pancreatic cancer.  So yay there. On to happier things.  Today I'm going to run into town on my one day off of work this week to pay my bills (that's why I work in the first place...I think. It's either that or indentured servitude.) and waste my time somewhere other than in front of the computer. GO ME, ROFFLFOEROLOL!!!!111 And remember, a wet dog might stink, but at least it's cheaper than your stank-ass cologne, biotch.I had this long and drawn out thing written about how Christmas should mean more stuff to everybody, but this craptastic thing decided to erase the entire post! So I'm just going to put this one up and tell everybody that reads this to enjoy their holiday season.Okay, first things first.  This thing isn't letting me edit ANYTHING. Try to add a link or change the title header, and IE spits up a 404 faster than a frat boy can scream "Whoo!" after downing his fourth....fifth.  So, I'm just going to give some homemade links to a couple of friends and their blogs. Enjoy!  urlLink Andrea James/ARJlog   urlLink Tekniklr/Teri's BlogI'm already tired of everybody else giving out links to their blogs to me like candy to a sugar-starved Halloween junkie, so I'm going to do something about it! Only this won't stop people from giving me links to theirs. Well....I guess that didn't work. Either way, I'm here to rant and roll. Those of you that know me should read this. Otherwise I might throw a fit until you do look at it, and believe me--we don't want that.Nnngh, the sick I am being!  OH NO it is the bad thing of fear and sicking vomit that turns us into the TWISTED TOILET god.  A spoon is a happy friend radar.The cold seeps into my heart like a sponge soaks up liquid, slow and sluggish.  The rest of the day gets no better, as this frozen hell continues.  Burn, motherfucker. Burn.Days off are a great thing.  Who's to say it isn't our basic human right to sit on our duffs for a day of consciousness and do absolutely nothing but rest up?  So do the smart thing, take a day off to read a book, go out with your significant other, write a story, sing a song, practice your skills...whatever you want. "Let's stop praying for someone to save us, and start saving ourselves. Let's stop this and start over. Let's go out--let's get going."--KMFDM "Dogma"I wasn't invited to anything last night.  Not an inquiry, not a spared glance in my direction, nothing.  I consider myself to be good friends with several people at work, many of whom were going to certain get-togethers.  Not a word.  On top of that, I was expected to do the work of around 3 people today, which isn't unusual, but I didn't need it on top of already feeling manic depressive during the 8 hours of Kiss Customer Ass-athon.  And one of the girls that was supposed to go see The Two Towers this evening (Good movie, go see. NOW, HYAH!) didn't even return my calls after making a horribly weak excuse about having to do her laundry.  During the short drive home that seemed like a long drive, I wanted a deer in front of my car so bad I could already taste the jerky. I wanted to die."What have I become, my sweetest friend?  Everyone I know...goes away, in the end."--NIN, "Hurt"I had two tests at school today, and my behind is dragging. But yes, I am still alive.  Toodles.Somewhere down the line, I have become a horrible monster not even deserving of death.  Whatever crime against humanity it was that I committed, it comes with a horrible, horrible duration of doing penance.  Today that penance was watching my new store manager easily woo the ladies I've worked with for years.  Talk about your "seduced by power" scenario.  Another part of the reparations was cleaning every inch of chrome in the store from top to bottom.  It was like a male Medusa, you scrub the chrome clean until you can see your own face, but you quickly turn away because of what you see there.  The art of being single is quickly becoming it's own satirical work.It dawned on me today that I really, really hate driving in inclimate weather.  An extra half hour of walking around the parking lot and the entire campus because of frozen car door locks will quickly change your mind about "how pretty that farking snow is".  Also realized that while some people really do care about what you think and do for them, most people simply wish you would crawl into a hole and die. Especially if you aren't some slack-jawed pretty boy, which seem to inhabit around 2/3 of the earth's surface. Yes, that means they're as common as water.  A flash flood warning indeed.God, save me from Valentine's day.  I hope that most of you (read: MOST) take those balloons and flowers, stick them somewhere creative on your own person, and crap roots and helium for the rest of the stupid ass weekend. Oh, and die.Okay, time for a sane update.  Yes, I was sick.  I'm not sure if it was some vague head flu or a sinus infection.  But I'm all better now.  Physically, that is.  I'm finding myself torn between two worlds this semester, and neither of them are that appealing.  On one hand, there is work.  I know the people there, but the environment is simply not conductive to anything resembling happiness, or enjoyment.  On the other hand, school is supposedly an accepting place that takes all kinds.  The problem is, that everybody seems to be the same anyway. Obsessed with image and themselves.  How can somebody feel like they have something unique to contribute when the entire population wouldn't give a fig if you did?  Frustration personified.If you're a girl that just walks up to some guy she vaguely knows, and jumps at him to wrap your legs around him, I don't want to see it. Put it away, or I'll beat your ass.One thing I've learned in the last year is that you should never fall for an overachiever. It only makes you look worse.  When I said I couldn't write anymore, I meant works of fiction and things outside of schoolwork. Surely I can still write some smatterings of social statements solely for satiating your sadistic standards.I don't think I can write anymore.  I'm sorry.Good frickin' grief, it's been like 3 weeks, and I still can't shake this cold/disease/curse of slow death.  I had to call into work again today, and I know they're getting pissed off at me.  (Oh no, I've called in twice in 2 and a half years, and others call in every other day without getting burned. Yeah, that makes sense.)  School's been hectic too, as we get ready for spring break.  So they like to beat us down before we go on vacation.  Another example of great human instincts. "Here's some work for your spring break so that you can relax. Mwahahaha! I'll go eat shit and die now...you wish! Gyaaahahaha!"  Dicks.It just occurred to me that I haven't updated this thing in close to a month. Sorry about that. Work and school have been beating me down like Moe's head under the letter press while Curly is twisting the top and making poor Moe's head want to explode. Sorry, Three Stooges reference. Deal with it.  But yeah, I'm likely to be busy for the next couple of weeks too, with finals week rapidly approaching. Ah well, c'est la vie.  Later.Oh, and Andrea's right. I don't know any frickin' elf, especially one that can fly.  I PUBLICLY DISAVOW SUCH UNSAVORY RUMORS THAT REFLECT AN UNTOWARDS ATTITUDE FOR MY CHARACTER. That is all.Weeeeeelll, my ol' buddy ol' pal  urlLink Andrea  decided to link me.  Everyone that reads this should waste their time reading how she wastes her time.  Er, not that she does.  I'm going to be reamed for that...but in a good way.  Water is a constantly original metaphor if used properly, and she uses it so well in her stories and poetry.  If people could be elements,  she would be the blossoming crest of a wave, salty and charged with the power of the ocean's thirst to know the land that it slowly conquers.  I hope that softens the reaming up a bit.For Teri, despite her adamant position.  Epoxy Siren  You were sticky, solder wires and human emotions sunning in Paradiso with Dante being his guide into you which makes old mannequins smile wishing for crumbs of your pi-life as numbers dismiss, words redeem.  Thank you, Teri.The first thing I should comment on is my uncle.  They decided to have the funeral visitation today and Tuesday.  This happens to coincide when I'm supposed to be taking finals.  I knocked one of them off today, and I'm pretty sure I did okay on it, hopefully a B.  The fact that I can't go to the funeral has been nagging at me since I heard the news.  The worst part? My uncle's grandson, who goes to the same college as I do, can't go either.  And he has physical ties of blood with the man, and was just generally closer to him.  When he talked to his professor to see if he could go to the funeral instead of taking his final, the professor told him he could take it the "first day of summer school". Vague, yes?  What a dick.Today was a cold day.  The weather outside was as dreary as the old man in the frozen tundra, stuck where he is with no hope of survival, the ice slowly working its chilling magic on his aching joints and bones until he at last feels the blistering warm embrace of death.  My uncle, Bob Foster, passed away from cancer today.  It was a cold day."Don't let the front door hit you when you're...stupid."--Brak  Preach on, brother Brak. Preach on."Then the unnamed feeling, It comes alive. Then the unnamed feeling takes me away..."--Metallica, "The Unnamed Feeling"  Preach on, Brother James. Preach on.Anyone that knows me knows that inspiration for stories springs almost daily from my work at the grocery store.  And why wouldn't it?  Almost no day is the same as the other, with more new elements being tossed into the proverbial salad every 8 hours I work.  Today while I was doing my onerous duty of cleaning the restrooms (The mens, if you must know) I happened upon some pamphlets promoting basic Christian dogma.  Something about the fact that these people have been dropped to the level of leaving the word of God in a public bathroom is simply disturbing.  Is it the hope that while doing those basest of bodily functions, this person will suddenly see the literature lying there, read it, and have a spiritual epiphany whilst doing so?  And in further irony, I have yet to see any of these pamphlets in the women's bathroom at all.  So either the men doing this don't have the nerve to simply dump a couple of the pamphlets inside of the women's door, or they've decided that the women simply aren't worth it. I'm pretty sure that's slightly demeaning.  Seeing colorful pictures of happy people with "Jesus Lives!" or a somberly painted crucifix with "The Second Coming" in boldface above it serves as a background for bathroom brainwashing.  Knowing somebody else would later anyway, I toss the pamphlets in the toilet and flush them with the rest of the human offal.Lately the creative juices have started their Tour de Body` around my circulatory system, so I might start writing again dangerously soon.  I had to get the word danger in there, because it's DANGEROUS. Whoo!Today, I consider myself the loneliest man in existence.  Thank you.Well, the hour grows nigh.  We're leaving bright and early tomorrow morning (Or maybe just early, since the sun might not be up).  I'm not really sure if I'm looking forward to this--every vacation, apart from where we go, seems the same. We see some stuff, get lost a few times on the way, scream at each other, annoy each other, and then come home.  I know they make movies about crap like this, but is this NORMAL? I want to go somewhere and relax, not worry about finding Upteenth Street and Hairy Avenue.  Ah well.  For those that read this.....signing off.This is a heads up for those of you that don't know: I'm leaving Thursday (31st) to go on a vacation with my folks, and we're planning on being gone at least 8 days, so don't expect to hear from me any time soon. Lament, ye faithful, lament!I forgot to mention that Sherry dropped off a huge freaking bag load of stuff for me to work my way through, i.e. books and even an album she burned (with some weird cover art to boot).  The books are some of these multi-epic series, like Wheel of Time and Sword of Truth, except these mostly seem to be from the 70's, a period in fantasy I know woefully little about.Sherry stopped by work today, and despite me telling her multiple times that I wasn't angry at her, I still think she's still thinking that.  The fact is, that if Lisa (woman that's been making my work a living hell of neverending drama for the past weekend) had seen me talking to ANYBODY, and not doing anything for all of 4 seconds, she would have barked off a command of some kind.  I mean, Jesus.  She was giving me somewhere around 2 seconds to bag one order, and then scramble past 4 empty lanes and bag a can of soup somebody bought. So BAG YOUR OWN CAN OF SOUP, YOU PREMIE TRICK ASS CHEESE WHORE! Bam!Just got back from another night with Sherry.  I know that people say that variety is the spice of life, but we've pretty much done the same thing for two weeks straight now.  Meet up, go to a park, talk/walk around, do some assorted stuff around town between, and then grab a little bite to eat at-of all places-Sonic.  The funniest thing is that I never get bored doing this.  It's the same routine, but it's definitely not the same trip.  P.S.  Sonic Cream Slushes are the wicky-wicky bomb.  Thug4Lyfe. *wessides*I got my car back!  ....and it smells pretty!  I guess that's a good thing.    Right? Sure, I'm right.Something's wrong.  I've won 3 games of chess in a row, 1 of which the person I was playing simply smacked me around last time.  Now, I don't think I've improved, and I'm not sure you can actually get worse at chess, barring brain damage of some kind, but geez. What's up with that?Curses!  They didn't get my car done today, so they're HOPING they'll get it done tomorrow. Argh.Holy smoking crap!  I just got a call from mom, and the bill for my car repair is going to be THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY BIG ONES.  The thing is that mom had said she would pay for the 100K mile check-up, but this is a little bit past what she was expecting to pay.  With tuition and doctor's bills from a couple of visits last month,  I'll be living in cardboard style and sipping up mad puddle water to keep myself alive! Jebus!  I guess I'll be forced to stop using the gas pedal for a while.Well, today was one of my two days off.  Yes, my weekend comes in the early or middle parts of the week.  I didn't do too much except mow most of the yard, which I loathe....and talk to Sherry while she was at work, at least through e-mail a little bit.  I hope it doesn't bore her to death--but hey, if somebody came to visit me at work, or just called to say hello, I'd think it was nice...if a bit weird.  Dad invited me to go to work with him tomorrow up in Lexington, but he'll have to get up really, really early to go there, and tomorrow will almost definitely be my last day off before vacation.Oliver Twist I've become, definitely wanting more gruel in my pot.Your  A rosed envelope snacks on my nostrils, intoxicating even the town drunk, some inebriated fool that I have become.  Here the earth's loving bounty lust'd bursts in my mouth afore the end of the days I call my life.  A sugar'd saint sails down my neck, redeeming me until I can't remember the scent of you.Bwaahahahahaha! Tremble and behold, mortals!  The muse has smitten me upside the head, making creative images dance through my cranium like hordes of cattle in "Riverdance".  Eat your heart out, Michael Flatley.Jesus, women are confusing.  That is all.In some horrible mind game, the teacher of my 5 week summer class had me completely convinced that I was failing everything again, even going so far to say "You should have taken that Incomplete."  Needless to say, this did not sit well...considering that I got a C in the class, which is enough to make sure I go back in the fall.  Not to mention the admonition, "You can write better than this, Jason." Oh, hi. I'm Jarrod.  I  wrote the paper, kthxbi.  Jesus. But at least the 5 years that had been taken from my life have been added back to my sum total of...uh, 32, probably.  At least I won't have to worry about middle aged crises, although a little red sports car would always be nice.  And on the column to the left, I've added a link to Sherry's blog. I'm sure she'll appreciate that, heh heh.Nightmares always come back, so they say.  Or at least they say that in the B flicks that you see on Sci Fi or TNT late at night.  For me, one of those nightmares was the semester I had to take off from school because of my poor grades. And now, because of an ill-conceived 5 week summer class with a maximum of 2 overall assignments,  I might find myself facing that again.  Essentially right now, I'm not talking to anybody except my parents, and that's just because they live with me.  Otherwise...let me sort this out.Jesus. I think my English department head  hates  me.  How craptastic is that?So, today was a pretty busy day at work, being the Labor Day weekend and all.  I didn't think I'd get off early.  Heck, why would I?  I don't on a regular weekend, much less a holiday one.  So they let me off around 15 minutes early--so I missed Sherry, who was going to leave my sunglasses and a little romantic notion of a flower on my car.  Le sigh. Cruel, fickle fate."How well I have learned that there is no fence to sit on between heaven and hell. There is a deep, wide gulf, a chasm, and in that chasm is no place for any man." --Johnny CashAhh, the fun time approaches. The 2nd week of school, now that we're all situated, and Sherry's birthday on Tuesday.  She won't tell me what to get her, and I'm not sure myself.  Mysteries, blarg."There is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain. We have still a thirst unquenchable, to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs. This thirst belongs to the immortality of Man. It is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence. It is the desire of the moth for the star. It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us, but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above. Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave, we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone. And thus when by Poetry, or when by Music, the most entrancing of the poetic moods, we find ourselves melted into tears, we weep then, not as the Abbate Gravina supposes, through excess of pleasure, but through a certain petulant, impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now, wholly, here on earth, at once and for ever, those divine and rapturous joys of which through' the poem, or through the music, we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses. "--E.A. Poe, from "The Poetic Principle"  Wow, Poe said that in a not so morbid tone of voice. Yay.  But it's true--every word of it.It's been a scorching weekend, and I'm tired from work.  On the bright side, school starts back tomorrow.  At least it's something different to do, although I'm getting quite tired of it."GIVE ME CANCER NOW, GOD."--Adam Sandler, from the Zagat's Restaurant Skit from SNL, circa mid 90's.Argh! It was six bazillion degrees today, my shirt at work was almost soaked through with sweat.  And now I have to come home and mow the yard!  But I'm so not spring time fresh right now that I could probably roll around in the grass and kill the whole frickin' yard.  I would be afraid to go to the field behind my house for fear that my neighbors cows will start licking me because they've mistaken me for a salt lick.   Argh.  I want to be COLD.Yeah, so I forgot to post that we were actually back home.     .... ....  My bad.  We're home.SURPRISE!  Dad brought his laptop from work on our trip toss some mapping software on in case we got uberlost.  But the trip is going okay so far, so that's a good thing.  We've had some scares, and it's rained almost every day.  But we have some pictures of stuff too, which is a good thing.  And yes, my hotmail addy had 60 messages in my junk AND inbox folders, but almost none of them were from actual people I know! I'm shocked!  Come on, people! Show me the love! (Unless there isn't any...which is something we need to talk about whenever I get back, apparently.)  But yeah, it hurt not seeing any messages or anything. That does NOT mean to flood my e-mail box with random crap.  Ah well, I probably won't get on the 'net again until I'm home, which I hope to be Friday/Saturday.  Just letting everyone know that I'm alive.  P.S. We are presently in Southington, Conn.Well,  urlLink Andrea  has managed to put together a list of the type of scum and villainy she's looking for in her quest to be Matriarch of the Pirates.  Of course, I'm stuck doing the menial work.  Heck, I'll probably even be the poor cabin boy that gets it from the first cannon fired, then the captain or whoever sobs over my shattered body whilst I speak, "I's ne'er got a chance to LIVE, cap'n!"   Or the sad fact is that maybe she actually DOES want me to be a pirate.  Oh well. Ninjas are cooler anyway.Late night, brakes lock, hear the tires squeal Red light, can't stop so i spin the wheel My world goes black before i feel an angel lift me up And I open bloodshot eyes into fluorescent white They flip the siren, hit the lights, close the doors and I am gone.  Thrice, "The Artist in the Ambulance"  This song gives me chills.Whoo, some changes around here.  I'm actually happy with school and *Gasp* some days I go to work, and now there's a link to my friend Eric's blog, too.  And in case he ever reads this, sorry I couldn't make it to your house on Labor Day, chief.So, I'll just go ahead and say it--I screwed up, and nobody is going to change my mind about that.  This happened Friday at work--definitely one of the more stress inducing days we have in the grocery business.  Fortunately, everything was going smoothly this day--we weren't too busy, had a good bit of help scheduled, everything was going well.    Then Katy came in.  Katy is a girl that I get along with pretty well at work--we both have a little bit of the same sense of humor, we both pretty much hate where we work, she's going out with a guy out there who is a buddy of mine (and his brother kicks, too).  Now I had heard the stories about how she was prone to have seizures of some type before, but since she had mainly worked nights, I'd never been there for them, or even knew what sort they were.  About 10 minutes after she clocked in, she showed me her hand, shaking like a leaf in the wind. A few more minutes went on, and it kept getting worse.  I went to talk to her boyfriend to tell him about it, and we both decided that if anything happened, I'd call him and/or the manager on duty first.    I would ask her every now and then if she was okay--she was able to tell customers how much they owed, but she couldn't seem to manage to get the words out when I would ask her something.  Her eyes began hazing over, and her lower jaw would jar slightly.    I'll probably not forget what happened next as long as I live.  The shaking intensified, and she started trying to say my name over and over.  I ran to the register behind her and grabbed the microphone and called her boyfriend to the front in a calm, rational voice.  At the same time my hand left the microphone's button, she threw herself backwards onto the floor with the force of a tornado.  It was like somebody had a string tied to her neck, and they had just yanked it.  Another thing I won't forget is the sound.  Her head ricocheted off of the polished ivory tiles with a slapping sound, where she continued to shake.    I had been a foot and a half from her when this happened.  I was moving towards her, but....but I wasn't fast enough, or strong enough to do anything about it.  The eyes of the people after that...they knew I had been there, and they thought I had done nothing.    Which makes it worse, because even though I tried, I really didn't do anything.If you ask anybody, they'll tell you that I don't like to blow my own horn.  But we've submitted basically 3 things in the fiction writing class I'm in right now, and every time, the teacher, while reading them aloud or to herself, has commented in some fashion or the other that my writer's voice is, and I quote, "Great".  There are some pretty darned good writers in that class too, so I'm taking it as a heck of a compliment.  But on a sad note, the teacher did NOT like the fact that I tried to write from the perspective of a woman in my latest story.  This I found intriguing--most fiction has to deal with this at some point in a writer's career, and if anything, I want to be challenged while I'm in this class.  So, I'm not sure how to take it.  But I'm at least confident in my skills, something I've always had a problem saying before.   Maybe it's a sign of things to come.  P.S. Sherry and I are going to catch a flick tomorrow night, but danged if I know what we want to see. Not much on, honestly.So Sherry was running around town today and left a couple of gifts on my car--2 blue carnations, a card, and my sunglasses. Only they weren't mine--she'd gotten the cases screwed up and given me HERS.    Problem is that I really like them.  So I'll probably get my own pair.   But I still want MINE back, dangit.School's hitting pretty hard lately.  Got a test tomorrow and I've had to read 4 stories for my fiction writing class.  So far, with the exception of one story with a neat twist, the writing is sub-par and uninspired. I hope somebody else isn't writing this same thing on a blog of their own.  But they shouldn't be, heh.Went bowling with Sherry tonight, and she beat me in 4 games straight.  Uh, out of 4.   But it was fun.  Yeah.  I'll just be over here in the corner, plotting....mwaha.Whoo. I'm pissed at the world, surprise surprise.  I don't want any of you, and you don't want any of me.Great. Just fucking great.  Class sucked today, Sherry fucking thinks   I   suck, who the fuck am I to argue with logic like that?  Any fucking   good   reasons I shouldn't go wrap myself around a telephone pole?  Don't have a gun that would do the trick, so I'm screwed there.  I've got 3 cars, curvy roads, and all sorts of fucking medicine in my cabinet. That's all I need.   "Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker--it's just one of those days."--Limp Bizkit, "Break Stuff"Well, Sherry and I went out for the first time in at least a week today, because I've been recovering from a dastardly cold(which is still hanging on, by the way).  While I was in town for a doctor's appointment, we ran over to Red Lobster to grab a bite to eat.  Of course, service was slow, and she ended up taking almost a 2 hour lunch break, but it was enjoyable.  Those damned biscuit things they have are dangerously close to ambrosia.   You take those for a meal, then eat the angel biscuits they've got at Bolton's Landing, and you've got a meal of bread.  Jesus couldn't make a better meal than that, especially if it was unleavened.  Man, somebody needs to introduce the Lord and Savior to things like yeast, cheese, and salt.  Also I'd like to know who his personal trainer was, because in all European depictions of him, Jesus is cut like fucking Mister Universe.Sickness! Woe! Despair!  Large chunks of phlegm!  All this could be yours if the price is right.Well, this is strange.  So far everybody I've talked to today that has actually celebrated the holiday of Thanksgiving has had a craptastic day.  Parents getting in their face, sibling rivalries, heck, somebody I probably haven't even talked to yet is sicker than a mental picture of Rod Stewart getting it on with your mom.  (From the eating, not the mental picture.)  But my day has been okay.  Woke up, ate a little breakfast, gamed all freaking day, ate the traditional dinner, watched a DVD with dad and well, now I'm here.  I had a pretty good day.  So who pissed in everybody else's Cheerios?An older male customer at work said that men grow beards for two reasons: 1. They're not getting enough sleep, or 2. They're protesting something.  It occurred to me, having the current facial hair (if it can be called that) that I might be protesting something.  This isn't some external source like protesting Vietnam or legalizing pot, but maybe I'm just protesting something against myself.  I've been on these kicks before, but this one's definitely hung around for much, much longer than the others.   So an internal struggle might be going on, so bear with me.  At least I hope that's what it is.Sometimes I lose faith.  Not in religion, because I already don't have faith in that particular society.  It doesn't hold anything for me except mysticism, wasted days and already cliched rules to live by.  No, sometimes I lose faith in something much more important to me than religion.  My ability to write.    They say in the Bible that Jacob wrestled with an angel, who finally yielded to him.  More often than not I feel mangled by the words I'm trying to control, surrounded by a gang of them that pummel me with sticks until everything shines away into ebony.    Today I went to one of those lovely required reading events at college, and saw people well nigh avoid me.  I was not welcomed.  I didn't fit in there.  I see people winning awards because they're part of some hidden community that I'm never going to be a part of.  Some of these "writers" have skill.  Others...do not.  I'm not bitter.  I just wish I belonged to the literary Illuminati around here.Scariest. Christmas. Ever.   Well, this is one for the ages.  Everyone in the house's blood pressure has been maxed out and down to weak, piddling levels all in the duration of one hour.  Around 8:30 we decided to go ahead and open our presents.  Good, great, fantastic.  We've been waiting all year, right? Well, something like that.  We rip paper, open our respective gifts, say our customary words of thanks whlle unanimously agreeing that we all spent too much on each other, and otherwise be a family during X-mas time.  I'd already picked up a portable CD/mp3/Atrac3 player, lounging pants, some nice shirts, a book, and numerous other things, so I was quite happy.  I'd just finished busting open a beautiful picture for my room  (Hey, I need some better scenery than an old Kathy Ireland poster.) and suddenly, I notice my parents are looking at each other, since this was supposedly my last gift.  "Where is it?"  "I don't know, I thought you put it up and wrapped it." "Uh....no."  Now I'll just skip the tension part of the blog and say that my folks had misplaced a 400 something dollar digital camera, which by itself was worth at least twice of everything I'd received so far.  For a good hour they looked around the house.  No luck. They thought that it had been left at Best Buy, or been stolen, or any other list of miscreant acts.  They kept thinking I was depressed that I wasn't getting this monstrous item--but it was the fact that they'd spent that much in the first place.  But the worst part was easily that it was facing the prospect that they'd spent that much time and money into finding it, and then having nothing to show for it.    Everybody in the house began to feel sick at their stomach.    I was sitting in the living room struggling with one of the packages I already had when mom said "Well, I'll go check under the bed."  It sounded absurd.  The irony of finding something like that under a bed when I'd been notoriously doing that for years would just be too much to handle.  But the words had a ring of truth in them.  Dad had already gone downstairs to sit in front of his computer and mope, mom was still halfheartedly poking around.  Well, she found it.  It was like finding a river in the middle of the desert.  Barriers fell down, smiles lit up faces, and sighs of relief passed through lips like wind through the trees.  Scariest. Christmas. Ever.Well, I have work tomorrow.  My fever is down from 102 to around 99, which is way way, WAY better as far as I'm concerned.  The major symptoms that seem to be left are just an overall lethargy, runny nose, and hacking cough. I really, really wish my lungs had some kind of DVD-ish "eject" button so I could just toss all of this crap out at once.  Sure, it'd look like a bloody ball of three quarters digested lipids, but hey, when you've gotta get it, you've gotta get it.  So I'm going to be at 8:30 like a good little geriatric so I can hopefully roll into he--er, work tomorrow.8 hours get pretty boring when you can't sleep.  There's only so many things you can do.    Well, when I went to bed last night I was having hot flashes (Yeeeaaah! No, you sick freak.) chills, aches in my joints/general soreness, and running a fever of 101.  This morning, add a headache to that, take away the hot flashes chills and aching, and keep the temperature at the same level, and that's where I'm at.  So I'm going to go upstairs and watch TV with my mom all friggin' day.  Oh well.urlLink They  got me.We got  urlLink him .  What a phrase of Texas justice.  Might as well say "Pert near got 'dat boy lokt 'way, reckon?"Gahhhhhh, everything but my last final is over for the semester.  I've been busting my behind for the past 3 days, and now I want to veg, grow a beard, and play Madden and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic for THREE DAYS STRAIGHT.    But work beckons. Damn you, beckoning work. Damn you."Someday this place it going to burn. Is your whole life in there waiting? Someday your head is going to turn and you'll realize I'm missing, do you realize?"  Matthew Good Band, "Suburbia"   "There's holes up in the sky, the devil punched down to the monkeys. And now they've got drive thru,  and a video store where there used to be real live actors."--Matthew Good Band, "The Future is X-Rated"So, according to Andy Serkis, the actor that portrayed Gollum in all of the latest LotR movies, there's actually a GOLLUM PORN site out there on the 'net somewhere. Am I surprised? No.  Do I want to see it? No.  Do I want the hits from people actually looking for it?  Well, there'll be quite a bit of them, that's for sure.   And um, the Ring could be a pretty nasty sex toy, if you want to get down into it.    Hey, I'm just saying. Don't look at me like that, geez.  Pissant.Well, work's sucked a big honky lately.    We've had a startling lack of management for a mid-major level grocery store.  Quite sad, really.  Basically kids showing up and clocking in, talking with a little work mixed in for around 5-6 hours, then getting sent home.    And on an even sadder note, Mike died.    I know, nobody knows who Mike is.  I'm sure they're wondering why they should even care about Mike. Well, if you've ever wondered why martyrs do what martyrs are usually known for, it should make an interesting story. Mike was a bagger at the store.  He was at least 70 years old.   I  come home tired after a day of work, I can only imagine what he felt like.  A couple of years ago, his body basically gave out on him a day at work.  I'm not sure, but I think it was a heart attack, or something similar.  I wasn't there, but I knew the ambulance had to come pick him up.  Mike took off close to a year, maybe more, trying to rest up so he could come back.  Why, after having a serious health problem would he possibly want to come back to a physically demanding job?  He wanted to earn the money to pay for his wife's cancer treatments, because the disease was slowly eating away at her.  Eventually Mike came back to work, but nothing was the same.  He would work 3, maybe 4 hours a day, and he was obviously slowed down compared to even his old level of work.  Unfortunately, he knew this, and pretty much quit one day after realizing he couldn't do it.  And now, as far as I know, he's preceded his wife in death.  I'm not saying what he did was the right thing, or even if there is a right and wrong side to this story.    But it   did   happen.I Am A:  Lawful Evil Human Fighter Ranger    Alignment:   Lawful Evil  characters believe that a nice, orderly system of life is perfect for them to abuse for their own advancement. They will work within 'the system' to get the best that they can for themselves.    Race:   Humans  are the 'average' race. They have the shortest life spans, and because of this, they tend to avoid the racial prejudices that other races are known for. They are also very curious and tend to live 'for the moment'.    Primary Class:   Fighters  are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.    Secondary Class:   Rangers  are the defenders of nature and the elements. They are in tune with the Earth, and work to keep it safe and healthy.    Deity:   Iyachtu Xvim  is the Lawful Evil god of fear, hatred, malice, and tyranny. He is also known as the Godson and the Son of Bane. He appears as a gaunt, naked, scimitar-wielding man, or as a black cloud with glowing green eyes. His followers are working to strengthen his position in the world by converting (often by force) other deities' worshippers. They wear black robes with dark green trim, and wear black iron gauntlets with green eyes on the backs. Iyachtu Xvim's symbol is a black hand, inset with green eyes.

Thinking of how I used to have a life outside of diapers and nursing and how much I would love to go be intimate with someone RIGHT NOW.  Yum.If you live in Seattle and have never had a bonfire on the beach at Alki, GO!  NOW!  It's amazing.  We had one last night for the Winter Solstice and it was just wonderful.  Listening to the waves lapping at the shore, the crackling of the fire and feeling the moon gazing down at us from between the clouds on the longest night of the year was pure bliss.  Hell, just go build a bonfire wherever you are.  If it's private, strip down and be primal then write me at kymberleev@hotmail.com and tell me all about it.  ;-)I was just chatting with my friend, Mike, who ROCKS!  He made yet another CD for me of my favorite songs.  The last one has laser burns from being over played.  I'm a sucker for a good groove which is why I highly recommend the song, "At Night" by Shakedown.  Check it out.  I think you'll be shakin' your thang in no time.

Thinking about the regrets of the last year (NONE!) and all of the promise that exists in 2003.  Working on my website.

I had my first shot of Tequila, which was amazing and danced my legs off.  It's amazing what happens when you just let your inhibitions slip away and melt into the moment.  When I allow myself to really be present in the moment by drinking in the sunset, smelling my daughter's hair, responding to a lover's touch or just being aware of the blood coursing through my veins, I feel FREE.  I feel at ONE with the Universe.  Try it.  I think you'll like it.  :-)Here's some inspiration for these times: "I have learnt through bitter experience the one supreme lesson to conserve my anger, and as heat conserved is transmuted into energy, even so our anger controlled can be transmuted into a power which can move the world."  "Nonviolence and cowardice go ill together. I can imagine a  fully armed man to be at heart a coward. Possession of arms implies an  element of fear, if not cowardice. But true nonviolence is an impossibility without the possession of unadulterated fearlessness."  "I have not the shadow of a doubt than any man or woman can  achieve what I have, if he or she would make the same effort and cultivate the same hope and faith." -Gandhi.I just finished reading James Twyman's book, "Emissary of Love".

My oldest daughter stayed home from school today to have a Mommy day so we hung out much of the day then went to Carkeek Park in the afternoon.  The sun filtered through the trees and made the ferns in the forest seem to glow as we hiked the trails.  My baby was in her backpack and I held my 6 year-old's hand as we climbed up up up to the vista that overlooks the water.  She had her "spy" glass and looked around to see what she could see.  Later, we went down to the beach and stuck our bare feet in the freezing water.  By the time we got back to the car, our feet were completely numb.  I decided there isn't much better in life than being outside on a clear day with my beautiful children. I am so incredibly blessed to be alive!I have a new inspiration line!

The holidays this year have been a time of more simplicity which has allowed time for what is most important to me.  I have made fewer commitments, done less and spent more time at home taking care of myself and my children.  I just spoke with my Mom on the phone who said, "you sound so relaxed".   I am.  It feels good.    I think working out regularly really helps with relaxation.  I started this intense, effective, kick-ass work out program called Power 90.  You can more information about it at  urlLink beachbody.com .  It's a six day a week program that alternates cardio/abs and circuit training every other day.  I'm loving the physical challenge, I'm sleeping better and generally feeling like a new person.   The best part is that it's only 30 minutes a day and I do it at home!

I'm doing a presenation for the  urlLink National Expressive Arts Therapy Association's Annual Conference  in Honolulu.  It feels a little scarey but also exciting.  I am most delighted that I get to sink my toes into the sand in Kauai for a week after the conference.  MMMMMMMMMMM  I am feeling silky smooth after a visit to  urlLink Olympus Spa  in Tacoma.  If you've never soaked, scrubbed, steamed and saunaed (is that a word?) there before, you really should treat yourself.  It's amazing.    It's truly amazing what a difference a little self care can make in one's life.  I feel more grounded (and a little shinier!) after that experience.  Self love is a beautiful thing.  Yes, that DOES have a couple of  meanings.  Speaking of self care, consider the benefits of good colon health.  Did I say COLON?  YEP!  Did you know that colon cancer is the #2 cancer killer?  I had a colonic at the  urlLink Tummy Temple  the other day as part of my cleansing process.  The space is amazing, the people that work there are completely beautiful and I came out feeling better and more informed about my colon.  Stop feeling embarassed!  If we were all more open about such matters, colon cancer wouldn't be killing so many people.    So, indulge in a little self care and a whole lot of self love and live your best life!I am deconstructing my entire life, ego, sense of reality at present.  It's both frightening and liberating.  I feel as though every relationship, every role, every assumption I've made about anything is under attack by the part of me that seeks authenticity.

In March, the company said it would delay the international launch of the player due to stronger-than-expected U.S. demand and tight supplies of the hard drive, which is at the core of the player.  Apple had originally planned to start worldwide shipping in April. Earlier this year, the company said it had 100,000 preorders for the iPod mini, a smaller version of the popular iPod player that is about the length and width of a business card and holds about 1,000 songs. The company, best known for its Macintosh computers, has found huge success in digital music. Apple has sold more than 3 million iPods and has a 50-percent market share of digital music players. Its iTunes online music service is the most popular legal music download sites, claiming 70 percent of all songs bought online.urlLink Scott Hanselman's  has composed a awesome set of developer and power tools.

Such attention to detail is de rigueur in cycling, one of the most data-driven sports of all. Consider the numbers behind the Tour de France: 21 days of riding; 2,110 miles; 5,200 calories burned per day; a peak of 1,000 watts output at any given moment (enough juice to run seven iMacs). The two most important figures: 6, the number of consecutive victories Armstrong will have if he wins the Tour again (a new record); and 61, the number of seconds he won by last year, his narrowest margin yet.

Another Spaniard, this time of the French Ag2r squad, Mikel Astarloa with 7.98 litres.   The race’s lightest rider is the Russian Alexandre Botcharov at a frankly puny 54.5 kilograms, while the heaviest rider is Sweden’s Magnus Backstedt (Alessio-Bianchi) who will fly down the mountains thanks to his gravity-embracing 98 kilograms.   But the big Swede is prevented taking first prize in the tallest rider competition. Instead, the title goes to a Frenchman: Guillaume Auger of RAGT at 1.96 metres. French fans must be going crazy: there’s a second win for them, too, thanks to Ag2r’s Samuel Dumoulin who obviously never ate his greens, measuring just 1.58 metres.   Among the Tour’s 188 starters, average height is 1.79 metres, average weight is 69.9kg, average lung capacity is 5.74 litres, while the Tour peloton’s average heart rate is 51 beats per minute.This special pair of Oakley sunglasses with a built-in MP3 player that Lance Armstrong was spotted wearing.

I'm alternating between being excited and nervous.  Excited at the changes I might be making in my body, and nervous that this will be just another wieght loss program that I fail. BLEH.  I'm REALLY excited about joining a gym though.  I've desided to do that instead of trying to work out at home.  Now I'll just have to work on getting my lazy butt out of bed in the mornings and go there!  Of course having my sweetheart poke me in the mornings will help, as I'm planning to drag him along with me! 6 days!  Weight today - 186Let me start by saying - spelling is not my best subject, and if creativity in the execution of the English language offends you.  Then move right along, and don't spend much time here.  I promise to do my best, but there will be times when I'm in a hurry, and won't run the spell check as I should have.  For those moments, I appoligize in advance.  As for what this is for?  Well, I've struggled my whole life with my weight.  I've tried off and on for what has seemed my entire existance to have the body I would like, and though I'm doing better now then in years past, I'm still far from my goals.  And so, I've started yet another weightloss journey.  This one called Body for Life.  This is a weight training and nutrition program that involves a lot of commitment and a great deal of work.  As part of this program, there is a 12 week program.  A "Challenge" they call it.  And it's this challenge that brings me here.  My hope is to journal my journey through this challenge and hopefully motivate myself to complete this challenge.  Of course, loosing weight and getting into shape is one of my goals as well.    The actual challenge doesn't start until Jan 6th, and until then I'm trying to loose the two pounds I put on at Christmas, and survive the New Year and my birthday - modist Goals, but there they are!  Weight today - 185 Size 14 jeans Size 16 shirtAnother great day yesterday, and I'm feeling grand.  The only fly in the ointment is that I checked the "Protien drink" that I drinking in the mornings and discovered it is a "Meal Replacement Drink" with 27 Carbs per serving!  Gack! The good news is that I've only been drinking it for two days.  No wonder I liked it so much!  So, I skipped the drink and had some eggs for breakfast.  I guess it back to finding a protien drink I can stomach.  I liked having that convienance in the mornings.  I liked the premade drinks from EAS, so maybe I'll look for the powdered form for my morning meal.  I'm SO glad that today will be a 'rest' day for my workout.  My calves are SCREAMING at me!  I got up in the middle of the night last night and found I couldn't straiten my legs.  I had to hobble to the bathroom.  I knew I had overdone my calf workout, I just didn't know how much until last night.  Other then that... the workout last night was GREAT.  I ran/walked my 1.5 miles in 21 minutes and still managed to hit a 10 on that workout.  I'm continuing to take my weight workout easy.. not going for the 10 yet... it's obvious that if I had worked the rest of my body the way I had my calves that I wouldn't be able to get out of bed this morning.  Maybe I'll add a body part at a time and take it to failure.  It's a thought.  All other parts of the day were great too.. food was good, water great.. got 8 hours of sleep... another 5 star day!  I had to battle the cravings monster lastnight when I went to clean up the leftover cookie dough.  I LOVE to eat cookie dough and could almost taiste it!  Instead I chugged some water and filled the bowl full of water.  It didn't look so appitizing after that.    My darling Fiance informed me this morning that he's gained 2 lbs already :)  I'm hearing dance lessons in my future.  In the mean while, I'm signing up for ballet classes, and adding that to my workout schedule.  I took ballet for 8 years as a kid and am looking forward to doing it again.  So, my goals for today are: Stay under 20 carb grams Journal my intake 10 minutes of pilates REST 62 oz of water less then 62 oz of soda Read some more success stories to stay modivated I already took my vitamins I plan to get 8 hours of sleep  weight today - STILL 189... but I'm getting stronger already, I can tell!Let me start off with a great big.. Wooo hoooo!  I had a GREAT day yesterday, and I've continued the trend so far today.  I think I had a 5 star day! :)  Let's calculate, shall we?  Food - Journaled, and of good nutrition.   Exercise - Lower Body workout, 1.5 miles ran, 10 minutes of pilates, and all journaled. Hydration - drank 62+oz of water, and had 52 oz of soda Attitude - journaled (a lot!) and got some motivation off the net Energy - 8 hours of sleep and took my vitamins  Yep it was a five star day!!    I took it a little easy on the weights.. until I did calfs then I overdid it a bit.  My legs were shaking when I was done with that.  By the time I got to the treadmill my legs were rather tired, but I still managed to get 1.6 miles in 23 minutes.  Not the three miles I had hoped for, but it has been a long time since I tried to run seriously.  The best news was even though my legs were VERY tired, I got out of bed and was able to put full weight on my foot this morning.  No pain!    I've managed to bypass several temptations today as well.  The cravings hit when I drove through Burger King for a soda.  Boy those cini-minis looked good! and then at lunch when I got my car cleaned they had these chocolate cresaunts that made me look twice.   But I kept my goals in mind... #1 to kick my DFs butt in the complition we're having.  First one to lose 10 lbs is the winner.. and if I win.. I get dance lessons for the two of us!  Needless to say that's quite a motivator for me.  We're also talking about a small pay off for each day one of us goes to the gym and the other didn't.  He's going to owe me SO big. :)  My goal today is another 5 star day...  I've done good in food and journalling -  Tonight I'm going to the gym for a upper body workout, an 1.5 mile run.  And then later 10 minutes of yoga.  to be documented of course! I need to get started on my water, but I've stopped drinking soda for the day.  I think I'm finally at a good point in that addiction.  I'll maybe work to eliminate that entirely eventually, but one step at a time.  I'm going to stop somewhere and check out some success stories for some motivation as soon as I'm done here.  I already took my vitamins and I'm planning on 8 hours of sleep.. :)  Yay me!   Oh, and I'm down 1 lb since yesterday.. I KNEW I was feeling lighter.I just have to say that my Fiance is the best! I talked to him today about my frustration with my motivation and he immediatly stepped up to the challenge.  We're working right now to come up with some goals and rewards and we're going to keep each other on track.  I don't know what I would do without him!   I've also desided that one of my goals each day is going to be to read something inspirational, or motivational - it doesn't have to be wieght related, but I've found that reading the success stories on the various web sites has done much to lift my spirts and renew my 'can do' attitude.  AND - I've been a good girl food wise today.  It's 4:00pm and I'm still feeling pretty energized.  I'm working on my first bottle of water, have journaled all my food, and have a date with my DF (Darling Fiance) at the gym tonight, so I'm looking forward to having a 5 star day! Umm.. or maybe I need to come up with some sort of raiting system.  Let me think about this.  Here are areas where I can struggle or do well...   Food  - journal  - nutrition Excercise  - Weight training  - Marathon Training  - Stretching  - Journal Hydration  - 62 oz of water  - Less then 62oz of Diet Soda Attitude  - Journal  - Motivational Reading Energy  - 8 hours of sleep  - Vitamins  So that's 5 areas At the begining of each day I'm going to evaluate the day before and give each day a number of stars -  So far today  I've got 1 Star for food as I've been journaling and eating nutritionally sound -- a 0 for exercise, but I've got a plan in place to make that a 1 as well -- a .5 for Hydration as I've only had 52 oz of soda, and I'm on my way to another .5 as I guzzle my water -- Attitude is a a slam dunk for a one because I've done nothing but journal and look for motivation today -- Energy, well I have a .5 there as I took my Vitamins, and hopefully I'll get 8 hours of sleep tonight.  I think I like this!  Oh, and I can already tell I'm eating better today.  I feel lighter, and just.. BETTER already.Forgot to set some goals for today -   - Take vitamins - 3 mile run - Lower body workout - 10 minutes of Pilates - 20 net grams of carbs - drink 2 bottles of waters  I've accomplished 1 already.  Took my vitamins this morning.I don't know what happens to my energy levels.  I really do need to get in to the lab and get my blood work done.  Yesterday I was feeling grand, looking forward to going to the gym, and then, by the time I got home I was exhausted and it was only 5:30! Needless to say I didn't make it to they gym.  I used the excuse that it would have been awkward with my fiance's car in the shop, but I could have made it work if I had really wanted to.  It reminds me a little of the bible verse that says something like...  I know the things that I must do, and yet I do not do them... it certainly applies here.  I just another of those 'educated' fat chicks.  I know what I need to do.  I know the things that will make the changes in my body, and yet... somehow I always manage not to do them.  It's really nothing more then lazyness.  Well, lazyness and a love for food... *sigh*  BUT, today's a new day.  A day when I can do the things I must do.  I'm three weeks into this challenge with nothing to show for it, but a gym membership and a cupboard full of vitamins.  But, on the other hand, there are over 8 weeks left in this challenge.  Still time to make some major changes for the better, do be one step closer to the lifestyle that "I" want.    I just had an idea.  You see, although I know that I am at an unhealthy weight I really don't think I look that bad.  I never had issues with the opposite sex, and my fiance makes it very clear that he loves me the way I am.  In fact he worries that my goals might be too stringent and that I might get too skinny.  My Dr, though has made it clear she wants me to loose weight, as she's worried that it may begin to effect my health.  It was she who suggested I alter my eating habits toward a lower carb lifestyle.  I did that and have lost SOME weight, but as always I've stalled around the 185 mark.  But, I think one of the reasons I've stalled is that I'm trying to reach other peoples goals.  Loosing weight because my Dr, or society tells me I need to.  Intellegently I know that my health will suffer unless I make some changes, but that doesn't seem to matter when I come home tired after a day of work, or when someone announces that there are paistries in the break room.  Still, there are some things that I want to change.  I'm tired of being tired.  I hate that I wake up exhaused.  I know that healthier eating, and exercise is supposed to change that.  So, I need to come up with goals for ME... yes, reaching 130 is a goal for me, but it's not priority... it's not enough to make me change... But perhaps some other things will.  My wish list  1 - To have more energy 2 - Run a Marathon 3 - Wear size 8 4 -   I think I'll continue to add to this list and perhaps ever post it up somewhere.  There has got to be something out there that will motivate me!!Back in the saddle again.... Everyone sing with me! Back in the saddle again!  That time of the month hit me, and I couldn't seem to put enough food in my mouth.  I blew it BIG time.  The good news is, I'm ready to start, again.  One good thing that's happened is that I finally got my gym membership.  Horray! Another step in the right direction is that I've cut WAY back on my diet soda intake AND I've gotten a good supply of all the vitamins I think I'll need.  It's a little daunting to look at that handful of pills, but I've been taking them for several days and I think I might be starting to feel a difference.    So, I'm wondering.  Is there anyone out there?  Am I talking to myself?  I'm wondering if posting a food log might help me stay honest.  I think I'll try it.  So, if there IS anyone out there, check up on me, and help me stay on the right track.  I'll be going to the gym tonight for the first time as an 'offical' member.  It's the middle of the week, but I'm going to start where I should be - 20 minutes of aerobics.  I'm going to try to get up early in the morning to work out, but I'm NOT a morning person so it make take a while for my energy level to go up, then I'll think about morning workouts.    One of the things I'm struggling with, is that last year I set a goal of doing a marathon this year.  I had started training, until I strained the arch of my foot, and I had to stay off of it for a while.  I got treatment, and I'm feeling pretty good.  I even ran on my foot and was pain free.  But, the BFL FAQ suggests that you NOT do the program while training for a marathon.  If I'm going to do a marathon this year, it will mean starting training now...  The good news is that my current training level is light.  It probably falls within the 20 minute aerobic workout even...  But I may have to modify the BFL program as the training progresses. (provided my foot holds up to the strain)   Lastly - I want to publically state my current "short term" goal.  On May 3rd 2003 I plan to be at or below 160lbs.  That's an obtainable rate of 2/lbs per week.  Of course that means sticking with my program.  But I KNOW I can do this.  I finally feel like I have all the pieces in place.  And, as I said before, the addded motivation of a wedding in 2004.  I picked May3rd because that will be the second anniversary of meeting my fiance, but it is also 1 year before our wedding date.  That will give me 1 year to get off the final 30 lbs.  That's doable right?  I figure with me loosing weight and he coming to the gym to workout, we should have to problem getting over the threshold.   So, my "to-do's" for today - 1) Link an on-line food journal on this page. 2) Hit the gym for a 20 minutes aerobic solution - (at least 2 miles per marathon training) 3) 10 minutes of Yoga for today's stretchingWell, I know I've been quiet, but things are going really well.  I haven't done as well on the excercise as I would like, but I'll be getting my gym membership soon, and that's going to make things a LOT easier.  Food wise I've been doing REALLY well though.  The weight is dropping and that's what really counts.  My plan so far is to eat when I'm hungry, and not get too full.  I'm drinking too much soda still, and I'll be working on that next.  But one hurdle at a time.  I'll probably not be making some glorious transformation in the next 12 weeks, but I expect I'll be making some major changes.  For now, I'm feeling better each day.  Weight today 182Day two!  I feel GREAT!  I got up and went to the gym this morning.  I paid the day fee so that I could run on the tredmill and do my cardio workout for the day.  It felt SO good, I am still feeling the high.  I really have to remember this feeling everytime I'm laying there making excuses for not getting out of bed.  Eventually, I'm hoping to feel this good after my weight workout, but we'll see.  The rest of yesterday went good.  I got 5 meals in, no problem, and feel as though I really stuck to the plan.  I'm feeling really strong and alert today, so maybe the good food is making a difference already.  I do need to get cracking on taking my vits though.  Taking pills has never been my strong spot, so I'll have to work on making that a habit.  I'm also planning on getting all my blood work done tomorrow.  Just one more way to measure my progress.  The only thing I haven't done, and don't know when I will get to it, is figuring my body fat percentage.  I saw a website once that figured it using the Navy's method, maybe I'll look for that again.    Weight Today: 185I know that in order to make positive changes in your life, you have to start with changing your mind.  This seems to be my major struggle right now.  For some reason I'm having trouble convincing my brain that it's possable for a woman, 50 lbs overweight is capable of making major changes in her appearance in only 12 weeks.  12 weeks, 3 months, 84 days - This is the time limit I've given myself to make noticable changes in my physique.  I sit here remembering the lumpy body that graced my before photos, and I find myself doubting.  So, where do I go to find proof?  I'm an american, and a child of the 80's.  We want our results and we want it NOW.  It's not enough to just know I'm doing good, I want proof.  I know that these are the thoughts that I need to overcome in order to make it through these 12 weeks.  Otherwise I WILL faulter.  The thing is, I have to deside NOW that I won't quit.  I guess that's the key.  Make the promise to myself not to give up, and then sticking with it.  We'll see, it's a little hard to belive right now.Today's the day!  I really wonder about myself sometimes, as yesterday I was already ready to quit, and I hadn't even started yet!  But, I pushed on, got my shopping done, and pictures taken and so far, I've been on track.  I was a little discouraged because I havn't gotten my gym membership straightened out yet, but I set up my total gym before going to bed last night and made it work for my workout this morning.  Because I'm so terribly out of shape I desided to go easy at first, so instead of doing the full five sets I only did four, and I didn't increment my weights because it's very cumbersome to do on the total gym.  I'm a little dissapointed that I'm not doing the whole program (My all or nothing attitude raising it's head) but this is better then doing nothing.  I have to admit my pictures last night were VERY inspirational.  There is no way I can look at those and NOT do SOMETHING!   I know I'm 50 lbs overweight, but I rarely see it.  The pictures really opened my eyes!  All my planning is paying off though, as today's meals are all in place, and I've got three meals sitting in my lunch bag ready for later.  I think I might have eaten too much at breakfast, but I guess I'll see how things go.  I am a little bummed because Ieft my water bottle at home, but luckily we've got a soda machine here that has water in it, so I'll be able to improvise.  It's almost time for my second meal!  Weight today - 186I've  been trying to set myself some mini goals before the start of this challenge, and have found myself failing misserably.  I really need to work on being prepared for the next day so that I don't have excuses for straying from the path. The good news is, I have new motivation for loosing weight.  The new year started with a proposal, and I'm now engaged.  With a tenative wedding date of May 3rd 2004, I think that will give me pleanty of time to get a bikini body before we go to Hawaii to tie the knot.  4 days until the start of the challenge and I'm doing all I can to get/stay motivated!  Weight today - 185.5Hmmm.. I can't believe it's been a week since I've checked in.  I had a pretty good week so far.  a decent upper and lower body workout.  Two good days of treadmill work, and a 5 mile hike on Saturday.  I have even been doing well on my food.. until Sunday when my Fiance brought home a loaf of french bread he won at the checkout counter while picking up some diet soda.  Oh it was SO good! but I got up this morning and the scale said 190!! *sob* I know I'm toning, and that my body is getting stronger.  I'm actually seeing an improvement in my energy levels and I think I'm losing inches.  but... 190 lbs! I have to say that that number has motivated me even MORE to hit the gym tonight.  I think I'm ready to start pushing my workouts to a level 10.. I just hope I don't overdo it.  I got an email from someone (Yay someone actually reads this!) Thank you for the suggestions for drinks.  I found the EAS Advant Edge "Carb Control" drinks seem to be doing the trick for me.  They are quick, taste ok, don't seem to upset my stomach, and only have 2 grams of carbs.  :)  One in the afternoon about 3:00 seems to hold me over until after my workout, so I'm satisfied.  For anyone looking for a "sweet treat" I have discovered Sugar Free italian sodas.  English Toffee, Carmel, Amareto... Throw them in the blender with some ice and milk and WALA a milk-shake tasting drink  I'm sure there's a way to throw some protien powder in there to make it a little more 'legal'  I make mine with whipping cream to keep a handle on the carbs.  I must remember to take measurements tonight....My weekend started fine, and then dissolved into a two day long 'free day' :| BUT, I am down to 187.5... I can finally walk across the room without pain, so tonight I hope to do my lower body work out again.  I'm going to be a lot more careful about my calf workout though!  Not much else to report.  I'm feeling confident, and better physically and mentally, even if my body isn't showing a great deal of improvement yet.  I'll give it time.I finally found the time to finish entering my food intake.  No wonder I woke up starving this morning!  I only had a little over 1000 calories!  My weight keeps dropping so fast I'm almost frightened, I just hope it doesn't rocket back up again.  I was down 2 more pounds this morning.  Though I did weigh late.  I'm still wating a week to try to get a baseline on my body fat percentage.  I took pictures last night too, and I'm not looking forward to getting them back.  I mean, I 'know' how bad I look but to really 'see' it - it's not going to be fun.   I haven't been drinking as much water as I should, but I'm working up to changing 1 bad habit at a time.  I also bought a - 'kit' I guess is the best thing to call it.  Some CD's and some flash cards that I'm going to use to start doing Pilates.  I may just start that tomorrow.Well, I made it through the day, and it guess overall it wasn't too bad.  Compared to what was a 'normal' day before this it was down right excelent.  My body's still dumping water weight, because I'm down another pound today - 199.5  I wish it could always be this easy!  I keep wondering what it would be like to know I could reach my goal weight in two months.. HEH.  Oh well... Next year will have to be soon enough.  And maybe, I'll deside I'm happy with my body before then.  Many of the girls I see, who's body I like, arn't at thier 'goal' weight so maybe I don't have far to go as I would think.  I just need to get through this first 12 weeks!  Overall I'm doing fairly well with my eating.  I even got into the cookies last night and instead of eating them, grabbed a handfull of them and put them in a bag in the freezer.  Knowing I was storing them away for my free day was almost as satifying as eating them outright.  ALMOST.  I'm going to keep doing that when I'm tempted.. hopefully the freezer won't get too full!Dinner was not good!!  I was really hungry and everything looked so good!  I really overdid it.  At least it seems like I did when I put it on paper, but I don't feel overstuffed physically.  I guess it's just going to take a while to break all these old habits.  I'm glad that I'm not starting my 'offical' challenge until next week.  Hopefully I will be adjusted by then.  Either that or I'll have totally given up.  I hope NOT the latter.  I guess I just had to get on here and confess.  Make sure that this wasn't an excuse to binge.I've spent a lot of time on the web today.  Looking for ideas and inspiration.  I think I may have found it in the MSN groups.  I found a group of women who are doing the BFL challenge and doing challenges between themselves!  I joined and I can't wait to see the difference I can make in 12 weeks.  I pretty much have the eating down.  I don't think that's going to be an issue for me.  I've started two food journals and (well it HAS only been two days) I've been keeping up on them.  I'm actually encoraged by how well I've been doing so far.  I know to REALLY do this challenge I need to figure out my workout.  I'm going to start on the 4th in earnest (the begining of the challenge)  Until then I have time to workout a workout.  I have a total gym at home so I'll probably use that for my weight workout.  I'm not sure what I'm going to do for cardio though since I can't see to get past the injury to my foot.  I need to find something I can do intervals with, as well as something that low impact.  Help?  Anyone?It's morning - I made it through 1 entire day.  1 down 83 to go.  I'm hoping that eventually I get a burst of energy, and some motivation and start to feel some HOPE.  At the moment I just feel so let down.  Everything I've tried has failed... I just don't want this to fail too.  I stopped at curves this morning to look around.  They offered me a really good deal, wich I liked, but I got mad at the high pressure sale techniques.  "Buy now or forget it"  Needless to say, I left without buying.    The good news is, I dropped two pounds since yesterday.  I know it's just water weight.. etc etc.  But if felt good to see it non-the-less.  I also took my measurements last night and started a chart of my body fat % so that I'm ready for whatever losses come my way.  I know I'm going to need to excercise to REALLY see results, but for now I'm just willing to see ANY bit of loss.  So, I'm trying to figure out my goals for this first 12 weeks - First of all - I want to be down to 177lbs. and about 46% Body Fat.  I also want to be down to (almost) a size 12.  Hmmm.  Just thinking that might be possible is encoraging to me.  12 weeks to a size 12? I wonder if I can do that.  It's certainly motivating to try.  At the moment I'm tracking EVERYTHING. what I eat, when I eat, why I eat, and how I feel after.  That way if I start to slide I'll hopefully see why.  maybe this will help me get a handle on my binges, cravings and emotional eating.  Can't hurt.  I just have to stay diciplined and stay on it.    Well, that's it for now.Well, it looks like I made it through the day.  I ate 6 small meals and stayed on plan.  I wish I felt better about it, but at the moment I just feel hungry.  I'm pretty sure I need to drink more water.  Perhaps that's where my hunger is coming from.  But, I did make it through the day.  One day at a time - one meal at a time.  I  didn't excercise yet.  I have 100 hundred reasons why not.  Most of them more like excuses then real reasons.  But I have an appointment to go to curves in the morning to figure out if I want to excercise there.  I'm planning on getting to bed early... I'm sure 8 hours of sleep will help out a lot.  Hopefully I'll feel a bit more positive tomorrow.I weighed in at 202.5 today.  I can't stand the thought that I'm over 200 once again.  I swore this wouldn't happen more then once.  why do I constantly let meyself down?  Why is it so hard for me to say "no".  I need to figure out this mentality of mine.  I WILL journal.  I think this is the key to my weight loss.  Figuring out WHY I eat instead of just what and when.  The next step will be to figure out a convientant way of doing it.  Must not fail to plan :)  So far today I had a fried egg and two slices of toast for breakfast.  I ate because I was hungry and felt full and satisfied when I was done.  For my midmorning snack I had a protien bar because I was starting to feel hungry.  I haven't had lunch yet. But I'm not feeling hungry or having any cravings.  It's the cravings that get to me.WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!! anione? simply anibodi care to go watch the concert wif me? plz.... preatty plz....i'll go on my kness if it has to b......aww... i'll pay for half ur concert tix..... plz...would simply anione go avril's concert wif me? if u do..plz inform me @91036937 .....i'll go grab e tiX!!!!=pAbsolutism    There are no absolutes for something so relative as a human life.  -Hugh Prather, Notes to Myself  Funny how it seems true when you read it in a book. When I say, at the age of 40, I want to write a book. When I say I want to be a hair dresser for 2 years. When I say tomorrow I want to meet this person, go this place, finish this much work, wake up at this time, and wear this. So how often have things gone the way I wanted them to? And how often have the results been exactly the way I wanted them to be? And how often, when the result has been the way I wanted it to be, have I been as happy as I thought I would be?   Has it happened to you that you wore this outfit that you never imagined yourself wearing 6 months ago, just because you had nothing better to wear, and got more compliments for it than on a day you meticulously planned your dress code? What are the chances of you making more close friends in 6 months of working than you did in 4 years of graduation? Has someone else's question ever given you answers and shown you realities that were always in your face? How often have things been perfect? When you do come across things that ARE perfect, how often is it that you planned them? Have you ever been bitterly disappointed that perfection was too perfect and lacked spontaneity, and hence, wasn't perfect after all?   So is symmetry perfect? Is asymmetry not beautiful? Isn't the now more important? Aren't mistakes more important than failures? So would you really like a spate of winnings and no losses at all? Is what I dream to be tomorrow, stopping me from being me right now? Is the life I am leading what I want? Am I living or existing? Is it wrong to want to live? For that matter, is it wrong when at times, you want to give up and don't want to live? Is it wrong that you don't want to be strong? But if you are, does that mean you are superior? Does that make you a better person? So who is a good person? If a social worker, who helps unknown people improve their lives, beats up his wife, is he a good person or a bad person? Are you a good person? Are you bad? Are you never bad? Does bad mean wrong? If you are being bad in self defense, is that wrong or correct? Did God put you/us on this Earth to make a point? Does he have to? Is there a point to everything? Should there be a reason for living? If you don't achieve all that you dream of achieving and are still content, are you a loser because you didn't get what you wanted or are you a winner because you don't want no more?So are dreams really important? Am I really important? 200 years later there will be no trace of this magazine or the person who wrote it. But the ideas will persist. That makes the thought important, more like significant, than I, the creator or thinker of these thoughts.   I may get two minutes of fame in the future, when I am 40 and dying of lung cancer. Is that worth wasting my youth doing what I don't want to do then? Is doing what I don't want to do really a waste? If not, am I gaining something here?Should you gain something from everything you do? If you gain nothing, is that an experiment that went wrong? So how can an experiment, where you cannot really predict an outcome, ever go wrong?   If you gain a lot, and you think you gained from a mistake, will you repeat the mistake, even if you know making it the second time would be harmful/hurtful/stupid? But if you do gain, isn't the mistake much better than all the corrects you have done in your life?So can you really control your life? Can you say with certainty that at 9 am tomorrow you will wear a red T-shirt and eat eggs for breakfast? So what is definite? Is anything? Does definite give you a sense of security? Is security tantamount to safe? Do all these questions merit answers? Does anyone have the answers to them? Are these questions really questions or statements with a question mark at the end?Does that matter at all?  ************************************************************************************* I am a question mark reincarnate. This is my mind being me. As for the time, I wrote this after I read the book Notes to Myself by Hugh Prather, at a particularly complex and crossroad-ical juncture of my life.  ] d e e p a [Aside from the bestial porn film my college friend so carelessly told me about while we were doing lunch,  another reason why I have a nauseated look every time I pass by a rotisserie is my introduction to "Frankenchick", the featherless, genetically modified chicken (I wanted to decapitate Eurydike when she sent me the Frankenchick image via e-mail).   How could you possibly eat such an ugly creature? Hell, this is not a chicken. This is a deformed, mutated monster.   I just love my vegetablesI am smart...Or maybe I am just having an illusion of grandeur...maybe it's all in my mind~a false pretense to cover up all of my insecurities. I have made a lot of moronic decisions in my life, all of which I regret terribly.   I inspired my good friend Eddie Vedder to sing this Pearl Jam hit (our torrid love affair went kaput nine years ago. Even if my love for him remains at nuclear intensity, I had to end our relationship because of his incredible fame.)   (Well, I don't give a fig about my controversial break-up with Vedder any longer. I am now engaged to a sensitive, philosophical NC artist so who cares about (as Weird Al Yankovic puts it) Mr. Spokesman for the disaffected grunge generation. Eurydike can have him.)    DAUGHTER by PEARL JAM    Alone...listless...breakfast table in an otherwise empty room  Young girl...violins...center of her own attention  The, mother reads aloud, child, tries to understand it  Tries to make her proud   The shades go down, it's in her head   Painted room...can't deny there's something wrong...

She holds the hand that holds her down  She will...rise above~  USELESS INFO~      1. I crunch on ice cubes (my sole addiction).   2. I eat fish food at age four.   3. I once played a character in an independent film.   4. After hearing my college friend tell me about this porn film he watched which advocates the practice of bestiality, I totally gave up on chicken.   5. Eddie Vedder was in love with me.   6. I believe I am acquainted with the reincarnation of The Tsar of All Russias, Ivan IV (he delights in scowling at me in class every morning).   7. I ALWAYS eat cereal straight from the box.   8. I can eat a hundred dumplings in 60 minutes (which probably gives you an idea that I have a large gullet).   9. I am engaged to Superman (and his real name is Paul Ambrose. Clark Kent is just a screen name. And by the way, he's not a Kryptonite. He's Italian).   10. I am your travel agent for guilt trips.My friend Eurydike, a clairvoyant and a self~confessed female chauvinist confided to me about her encounter with a couple of vicious jerks who unfortunately she had a brief affair with. This journal entry is not advisable for people with no sense of irony.      Vicious Jerk number one: Orkhomenos~ He may look suspiciously like Johnny Depp but any woman would scream "PASS THE BARF BAG!!" once they get a dose of his narcissistic attitude. A high school drop-out, his pre-occupations include getting intoxicated on weekends and playing in a pathetic rap metal band. Orkhomenos is now married to an unattractive woman and is trapped in hamburger joint-convenient store type of jobs.   Vicious Jerk number two: Narkissos~He is one of those bad things that happen to good people. According to Eurydike, Narkissos is terribly good looking, fairly intelligent and very hilarious (he is especially hilarious every time he congratulates and glorifies himself). Eurydike confided to me how she used to nervously wait for Jesus to materialize before Narkissos and her while they are doing lunch and witness Jesus jam a fork into Narkissos' aorta. But I told Eurydike that she need not hear Narkissos sing Bob Marley's "Waiting in Vain" in Latin or have him perform projectile vomiting for her to proclaim him the anti-Christ. He displayed evilness by tormenting her with his devious ways and that is enough (Eurydike succumbed to a nervous breakdown after her break-up with Narkissos. Funny, I thought she was born that way).     "Dear egotist boy you've never really had to suffer any consequence/You've never stayed with anyone longer than ten minutes/You'd never understand anyone showing resistance/Dear popular boy I know you're used to getting everything so easily/A stranger to the concept of reciprocity/People honor boys like you in this society"   ~Narcissus Alanis MorissetteI was part of Rage Against The Machine's political newsgroup for a couple of years. Unfortunately, it was terminated upon order of the U.S. Secret Service after the WTC tragedy because it was thought to be encouraging verbal attacks against Bush and the United States (which is, of course, merely a product of their paranoia).

I hesitate to believe this because...    When Adam and Eve were introduced to the tree of knowledge, they lost their innocence and was banished from Eden.    Marx, a man who is high on intellectualism had the audacity to question God's existence.    And maybe not all of us have pondered on the fact that technology shall be the fall of mankind.    Ignorance is such a blessing.It's impossible. If you had a million years to do it in, you could not rub out even half the "f*ck you" signs in the world. It's impossible."  ~Holden Caulfield JD Salinger; Catcher in the RyeSometimes I serge with power.  Sometimes I am unable to buckle down my euphoria.  Sometimes I feel really terrible.  Sometimes I want to go home.  Sometimes I hate my body.  Sometimes I want to love all my faults.  Sometimes I don't want anyone to look at me.  Sometimes I don't say what I feel.  Sometimes I regret what I did.  Sometimes I wish I was six.  ~Sabrina Ward HarrisonI created a post about anti-atheism entiled "The Skeptic Tank" and quite a handful spouted their so-called intellectual arguments about atheism and theism. One dribbling moron who goes by the name of Grebsnig wrote this out of the subject post:   "Has anyone here read this fruitcake's profile? She claims to have dated Eddie Vedder nine years ago, when she was 13. Even that astounding age difference isn't? the most convincing piece of information that leads one to believe that this affair is nonexistence, what solidifies this as a lie for me is that Eddie Vedder would never date some dope who listens to the Dave Matthews Band. Despite my loathing for [her] moronic absurdity, [I] thank [her] for giving me a good laugh."   Ha ha...I'm sorry Grebsnig but you are not a winner. When I claimed to have dated Eddie Vedder, it was ABSOLUTELY, DEFINITELY and APPARENTLY a JOKE. Now, you are the dope because you didn't realize that. I suggest that you find yourself a support group for crackbrains.  Anyhow, here are some of the arguments that were presented:  1)Perhaps you can justify your belief in the existence of God, but how do you propose to go about justifying It's existence? There is no subjective (or objective? I'm not sure which word to use) way to prove God. You can say that I exist, so there must be a God, but I would tell you that my existence is due to billions of years of evolution. The point is, you can not give irrefutable proof for or against the existence of God.  2)Why must something proceed from something else in order to exist? Was the CED created? What created the CED? What created the thing that created the CED? What created that?  I am not posting all of the replies because they are too many and will consume a lot of space. Here is my argument:       THE SKEPTIC TANK      All of us, at one point in our lives (I am also refering to the atheists even before they became atheists) have a clear and distinct idea of God. But all of these ideas are the effects of causes. Then there must be some cause of our idea of God. I came across my old notes and read something my man Descartes wrote: The three self evident propositions about causes:  -there must be as much reality in the cause as in the effect -something can not proceed from nothing -what is more perfect can not proceed from the less perfect  With the help of Descartes' three propositions about causes, I therefore say that nothing could cause my idea of God as a perfect substance that is not as perfect as the idea. Although I could be the cause of my ideas of physical objects or animals or man--since there is nothing so great or perfect in these ideas that I could not have caused them--I could not, however,have caused the idea of God because I am only a finite, imperfect being, whereas the idea of God is of a perfect and infinite being. So, something else greater than me must have caused my Idea of God, something which is at least as great as the effect, can only be an infinite,perfect being namely God Himself. Therefore, God exists as the only possible cause of my idea of Him.I am an inconsistent vegetarian.For a moment, I want to STOP spouting my so-called intellectual ideas because I am not after all a savant (it is just one of my pathetic illusions). Today, I am going to post an excerpt from the book, "Letters to a Young Poet" by Rainier Maria Rilke.   "You are so young. You stand before beginnings. I would like to beg of you, dear friend, as well as I can, to have patience with everything that remains unsolved in your heart. Try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms, like books written in foreign language. Do not now look for the answers. They can not be given to you because you could not live them. It is a question of experiencing everything. You need to live the question. Perhaps you will, gradually, without even noticing it, find yourself experiencing the answer some distant day."THE VIRGIN SUICIDES       The book just drives me insane.I created another thread which, this time, tackles capital punishment. Unfortunately, it hardly attracted flocks of enraged, pseudo-intellectuals. However, I am still posting it here anyway.      DEAD MAN, WAITING      I believe that capital punishment defies the true concept of justice. I give credence to the notion that the law of retaliation is not a sound principle of criminal justice and that perpetual confinement is the better option when it comes to penalization. However, at one point, I have questioned the credibility of perpetual confinement and supported death penalty. I thought that probably perpetual confinement is worse than death itself because it denies the convict of his freedom to really live and possibly even subjecting him to condemnation by his family/friends. But then, after a series of cases of people who were put to death and later were acquitted and proven innocent, I ended up declining to consider the idea of capital punishment...   ...now, I consider it as nothing but a screwed up, ancient concept of savageness.I am consumed by depression and my room is SO dark, I can't stand to stay even one minute there. It is funny how some of the people I know in art school glorify depression and view it as a "rockstar's disease" and they are all dying to wallow in it. Pathetic.Politicians always tell the truth...    ...when they call each other liars.LET IRAQ LIVE.All day Staring at the ceiling making Friends with shadows on my wall All night I'm hearing voices telling me That I should get some sleep Because tomorrow might be good For something  Hold on I'm feeling like I'm headed for a Breakdown I don't know why  See me Talking to myself in public And dodging glances on the train I know I know they've all been talking 'bout me I can hear them whisper And it makes me think there must be something wrong with me  I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell I know right now you can't tell But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see A different side of me I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired I know right now you don't care But soon enough you're gonna think of me  And how I used to be   ~UNWELL Matchbox 20There is freedom within, there is freedom without Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost But you'll never see the end of the road While you're travelling with me   Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof In the paper today tales of war and of waste But you turn right over to the T.V. page   Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart Only the shadows ahead barely clearing the roof Get to know the feeling of liberation and relief   Hey now, hey now Don't dream it's over Hey now, hey now When the world comes in They come, they comeTo build a wall between us Don't ever let them win   ~DON'T DREAM IT'S OVER Crowded House    I miss PaulieHAPPY NEW YEAR!!!  My resolutions: lose more weight.  I lost about 15 pounds this year, thanks mainly to my job and stress.  By doing simple things like more exercise, less fatty food, less soda, and less candy, my goal by April is to drop 20 pounds.  5 pounds a month, totally achievable.    Do more work.  That means getting up earlier.  That means less late night thingies.  But that also means less working late, more day time to have fun.  Find God, again.  I found him once through science, and now I'm going to do it again through soul searching.    I hope your resolutions go well too.    Have a great new year.  Hopefully 2002 was good for you too.Adding in more thoughts before I go to bed, I realize that Christmas and New Years, despite the blandness of them at times, I never forget that there are people out there who can't celebrate the holiday for various reasons.  Separation from family via death, duty(soldiers and the like) or hardship is something horrible.    Don't get me wrong, I'm not going to run this into a guilt trip.  What I do want to say is this.  The fact that we can celebrate the holidays at all are a huge blessing.  I am always happy to be in the company of my family.  Sometimes, I wish that I had options, but family is ALWAYS a good thing.  Be thankful for what you have.  Celebrate the simple things that we take for granted.   Happy holidays.I'd like to just say that a speed limit of 25 mph just about everywhere in the city is ludicrous.  Let me provide some background.  Alameda is an old town.  It's got a lot of history, it's got a lot of people too, particularly for a residential town.  Parts of them are pretty bad, especially near the Oakland border.  Parts of them are EXTREMELY rich, like Bay Farm Island.  New homeowners are particularly loaded.  Houses here go for $600,000 and up.  People here tend to be older, as far as I can tell, or family people.    What does this mean?  Apparently, it means that driving at reasonable speeds is unfathomable to them.  That means people with any sort of driving capability, like me, are sentenced to drive at some nutsoid speed like 25 mph.  School zones?  Fine.  Hospital zones? Fine.  But main streets and thoroughfares at 25 mph? That is, I reiterate, INSANE.  Try it sometime!  Drive down the street, at 25 mph.  See if that doesn't get you a few... fingers.  This is unreasonable.  In fact, it takes a good 25+ minutes to go 5 miles.  Idiots.    I don't know if the police enjoy it.  I don't even know if it's their prefernce to do it or enforce it.  They're doing their job, enforcing the law.  And that's fine.  But this is just idiocy.  In an age where the freeway speed has been upped to 65 mph, 25 mph in any road in the city is sheer idiocy.  I wonder how many lives this regulation really saves.Welcome to my blog!  Now I can pretend to be hip.Watching American Idol.    Now normally I don't watch these reality shows, but for some reason, this is a little different.  Three guys decided to blow off their practice sessions on American Idol to go out and party.  Some observations: First, you girls that went home with them or did scandalous things to get their attention or get on the camera?  There is a word for people like you.  SLUTS!!!!  "Whatever.  You don't know me."  I know that people like you are complete wastes of protoplasm.  You are the filth of the Earth who don't understand what the reality of life is.  I hope you got a souvenir of some sort... the uncurable kind.  As for the guys?  WTF is wrong with you people?  You've got no commitment, no responsibility, and I hope you fail in everything you try to do because that's what you deserve.  No priorities, probably spoiled and sorry little shits.  And this is not just for those three, but for the rest of you shits who think you can just ditch everything and leave it to the winds.  The world rightfully belongs to those who work hard, who try their best, who are responsible, who earn their keep.  We deserve the world, you deserve to rot and die.  To the rest of the world:  be responsible.  Understand the reality of the world.I'm an idiot.    I completely forgot that this weekend is Chinese New Year!!! I'll be out with my family. That's not the issue though.  The issue is.... I invited my friends and coworkers for a housewarming!  On Chinese New Year!!!! No crisis though, since at least I can hopefully move it to Sunday *crosses fingers*Back in the saddle!  That would be the phrase of the day.  I feel a little better about things lately, and am hoping for the best in life.  I'm doing a lot of cleanup around here.  This place feels a lot more like home nowadays.GOODBYE TO EVERYONE WHO DOESN"T HAFTER GO TO OOOOOOO HI! OOOOOOOOO! (ohio) ^_^We drove the car To the top of the parking ramp Fourth of July  Sat out on the hood Couple warm beers And watched the fireworks Explode in the sky  And there was an exodus  Of birds in the trees Cuz they didn't know We were only pretending  And the people all looked up  And were pleased And the birds flew around  Like the whole world was ending  And you can't leave me here Now that you're back you better stay this time Cuz you say, the coast is clear But you say that...all the time  So many sheep, i quit counting Sleepless and embarressed  About the way that i feel  Trying to make mole hills Out of mountains Building basecamp at the bottem Of a really big deal  And did i ever tell you  how i stopped eating... When you stopped Calling me  And i was cramped up Shitting rivers for weeks  And trying to convince myself I was finally free  And you can't leave me here! Now that you're back you better stay this time Cuz you say the coast is clear But you say that all the time  We drove the car To the top of the parking ramp Fourth of july  Planted my dusty boots  On the bumper Turned my head And looked up at the sky  ~Ani Difranco     "Independence Day"**DiSCALiMER** This is ROMANTiC love. Just so you don't confuse it with certain other types.  Love is, in all reality, an inexperiencable emotion. It is but a mirage in out minds, which they themselves are filled with lies and nailed shut with hopes of maintaining the lie. Half the population of this earth is incapable of experiencing the emotion, and since it's supposed to be a mutual feeling, the other half can only fool itself into thinking it experiences it. They can feel the want for love, because they think it exists, but they cannot feel love itself. I do not recomment trying to feel love,for it will only leave you feeling empty, depressed, and deflated. Perhaps you may find that one person who pretends to experience it at the same time as you, but that one is almost always the one that gets away, leaving you, in the end, empty, depressed, and deflated. LOVE IS POINTLESS! LOVE IS BULLSHIT!  LOVE... IS... NONEXISTANT.                ~Mithearwen  good luck matt.....hi! well.. i've had a tiring week. Woo.. i had to get up early everyday this week. I feel bad for you Prov people because you had to get up even earlier that i did for aa normal school day. I had to work on batiks in my art class. A batik is a form/stlye of art where you sketch something on a peice of paper, go over it in marker, and then transfer it onto a peice of fabric. YOu then stretch that peice of fabric onto a canvas frame and start painting with hot (melted) wax. We get the wax color from crayons and some parafin wax. After you finish painting... you crumple up the fabric and dip it in dye and the place without any wax get dyed with blue black ink. It truen out really cool.. and i've been putting alot of time and effort into it.         Anyway, i have this friend emily, and she love LOTR, Harry Potter Books, and Anime. She has written a harry potter fanfic and i think some people here would enjoy it... prolly not.. but its worth a try. The URL is this: http://www.angelfire.com/realm2/hop_emily/ravenclaw.html   so if you would go there.. thanks! oh and by the way... its really more of a Pro-Draco Malfoy because well... they think that Harry Potter is a "stupid Pansy who gets by only because of his own dumb luck." so... yeah...

Here comes a chopper to chop off your head!Several years ago, Kyle came up with an idea for an art exhibit in which he would blow up famous quotes, crossing out key ideas and adding "my dick" in spray paint.  The example he gave at the time was "Four score and..." MY DICK.  I chuckled heartily and forgot the whole thing. It's only recently that I've discovered how gold an idea it is.  Think of the possibilities:  "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man of large fortune must be in want of..." MY DICK.  "It was the best of times. It was the worst of times. It was the age of..." MY DICK.  "I pledge allegiance to..." MY DICK.  You could go for hours.Trying... testing... seeking... finding...a step at a time... still dun like the site now...Ma Belle, sontles mots qui vont tres bien ensemble, tres bien ensembleThe silence is deafening! It is like going back to the days when I used to study late into the night...Everything come to a standstill. Having the the chance to meet the inner-self. Do some reflection. One more time, going down memory lane. It used to be living the teenage days in memory lane. All those wild time in uniforms. Nowadays, it is just about the months from March to June.   I miss those time in the sofa, late in the night, alone, in darkness, staring into space. Enticipating for the morning, to be greeted with cheerful smiles, bright sunshine, cool morning air. You take a step back, relax and fall into the bed to cuddle the cool blanket.  Prepare the food in the later morning... see those eggs being cooked, smell the boiling soup... Cool showers for waking up in the afternoon and the day begins.... at 5pm. Words of love... calls for encouragemen...  Just 6 months and the world changes. Expectation and more expectations. Why the change? I miss those sweet evenings  The silence is deafening! It is like going back to the days when I used to study late into the night... but its different now.A simple chat or sharing that frustrating moment of the day are all that is needed to end the day happily. A hug or a kiss after the chat will make it even better. Life has too many expectation, even more when external factors are taken into consideration. Simplicity is often the most profound in many people's eye. How can someone be looking up to you at one moment and despise your attitude at the other?  I am just a simple guy, standing in front of you asking you to tell me you love me... asking you to hug me to appreaciate my presence... asking you to kiss me for the extra mile to go... asking you to support me in whatever I do...  and asking... Will you walk that tough journey with me?Gave up trying to edit page for today... ... too much of a cough to continue.Rainy!!! Cool and nice. Laze in bed, cuddle in blanket, relax at a corner... like a kitty!!!!! Cough mixture dun reallly work that well on me.Have not got the time to edit the page. Shall do that when I got time... in the meanwhile, testing!!!!!!!!WOW... has it been 5 months since the last time I was here? Have to put more effort into playing here.  OKay... Next time write some erotic stories... test whether anyone reading my site.OKie... long time no come here and play.  Breakfast... nothing (Rushing as usual) Lunch today: Plain rice, fish cake, bean sprout, sweet sour chicken (chicken sux) Dinner... Yet to decide, what to eat? what to eat?  Lunch topic -  How does the HR calculate the pay grade. HOw much money do you wish to earn per month.  Dream Dream Dream...........Last night, I finally got confirmation of the kiss... It hurts... but at least it is real. No longer wondering on why the not telling... not truthfully sharing. I rather know and drop everything.....  Many times I wonder, if he is really forcing her, she din like it, why then she still goes out with him? Somewhere along the line, there has to be some testing on whether he is the correct one. Well... perhaps if he did not reveal all these, she might be with him now. Cant deny that he  is a good pick... wondering about what she feels when she is out with him... during then... holding hands... walking down shops... well, she din like it now.  Memories of that fine Wednesday kept flooding my mind, out with him the earlier part of the day and meeting me in the evening. I felt so love then... walking her home....... but how was she feeling when she met him in the morning and me at night.... miserable? glad to meet me? prefer me to him.... or just "Phew".  How long was her life away without me? How was she expecting me to take all these? How did she want me to go with this relationship during that period of time. Is this a test of relationship? I know I can take a kiss... some fondles... but never beyond that. A kiss and fondle can be forced... but do you necessary have to go out again and again if it is being forced? Especially if she is one whereby I will do what I like.. you cant control me. So does she like him more than me....... for that period? I wonder again and again.  What is a relationship if you cannot say out loud what you do not like about your partner? What is a relationship when you do not share your troubles, share your time, keeping aware of what each other is doing..... at least generally. What is a relationship if you hurt the other so much...  Do people stay together just because they are afriad of lonelines? Do people stay together because there is some underlying benefits?  Do people stay together because the partner is the one to love me most therefore you will be happy?  Saying I love you is not the words I want to hear from you. its not that I want to, not to say but if you only knew, How easy, it would be to show me how you feel, more than words,  its all you have to do to make it real then you wouldnt have to say that you love me cos I already know.  MOre than words. Sometimes it is just more than words. I think I need a sign........I came here so that I can write down what marks my life for the past month. It has not been easy to know that you are lying.... you are with someone.. knowing what you have done and pretending things to be fine. Trying to do some mental debate on whether things are actually fine on all those sleepless nights. It has been tiring to debate with my inner self.  My heart race away everytime I imagine about the nights you are happily chatting away, picturing your outings and all other things... but not with me. I wonder how we have drifted in this short span of time. It was beating so fast that it aches to just think about how things have been going. It fits so well to the phrase " Love till it aches".  I came to realise that my life is coming apart just sitting here waiting.... waiting for a change in the current situation. I just have to take ownership of how things have become and how I can change it back to how things were. It has been a struggle. I have to decide on whether I should call people to ask about you. I have to decide on letting you know that I do know what is going on. I have to decide on whether all this is worth while. I have to decide on what to change in my lifestyle so that you know that my life revolves around yours. Most importantly, I have to deciede if I still want you.  Just like you, I have forgiven but I cannot forget... at least not in the near future. I have to show my love even more..... as with you showing me your love. We have to let each other know that we have each other to be the center of our lives. It hurts to know that love is not as intense as before... but we know that we can build this up again. We have been there, done that. We need to do this together... with love.  I have learn from the NLP that your thinking dictates your outer actions. I am trying to change my mindset on how things have been... I hope you do too. Give ourselves some time to build this up again... I love you.Life is so fragile. One moment you are here and the other you might just be gone. Live life to the fullest so that you enjoy every moment as if this is the last day of your life. Dun be sad... be happy. Then wat the heck am I doing in office? Should tell Sabby that....  Minds and thoughts are such complicated stuff that you never know how one is thinking. Some fickle minded, some strong minded, others are just plainly without any thoughts of their own. If it is so easy to change thinking about something, who will ever coiled the phrase " old habits die hard"? Trying to take some stuff of the mind, cant do so...  "Ultimately, Enjoy!"  I think I am enjoying the moment I have back in the memory lane... so I guess I am still fine.  I am stressed... stressed by all the unnecessary stuff in my life. Stressed by those stuff which to other meant nothing. So why am I still thinking and trying to make good?  I need a Drink!I figured what happened. Thats coz I was staying in the past all the while. Thinking of that sweet smile, that loving look.  Just remember that night, the distance felt and the disgusted look from her... Sigh... never the same again. Still she make my head turn when I see her.  Remembering that time when I was going to call her to look at some pretty gal and realised that she is the one... ha!  Have to start thinking or self talk tat she hates me, she hates me..... Yet, I dun mind being hated, just being here is enough. What contradiction!   The dilematic me now... is there even this word?I wonder how much of a memory lane I am going to walk down before I decide to track a different path. Sometimes it is just difficult and pictures just float into my mind. No one says it was easy to forget someone that you love. The question is do I really want to forget about her and pretend nothing has happened?  Why people always do not know how to treasure what they have. It always have to be at the moment when they lost it that they are whinning about it. So I am just common after all, taking things for granted. Does she knows that I even love her even when I am not around, working, wondering how she is doing?  Communication is everything in any relationship. You know that you are gone when two are not able to communicate and talk over things like adults. Was I even given the chance to talk or was I just so insensitive about everything?  Work, by itself,  often has no meaning if you do not have any targets to look forward to, no one to share the joy of accomplishment and agony of some stupid colleagues that backstab you to look good for herself. She has to listen thru some of these stuff, but at times with all her troubles you wonder if you should boke her down with all the unhappy moments in the office. Next time, ask then share...  Feelings. There is nothing in this world call I know you so well that I can predict what you are going to do. Utimately, I dun know that she remains upset and she din know that I still love her despite all the arguments.  Base line for everything... GET A GOOD HANDPHONE THAT WILL NOT DIE ON YOU WHEN IT IS CRITICAL FOR YOU TO TALK. A good relationship that you treasure might just be lost like that... coz you are not able to get her at the time that matters most.  Well... if she comes back... take her back anyday. For how long....?update, i got 1 character for ninjaturdles! yea! so yeah its a work in progress along with my other duties with work and school. currently im trying to migrate a WIN NT 4.0 server to WIN 2003 Server.

Can you dig it SUUUUUUCKAAAA??!!!!!!     urlLink RHAPSODY LinkRemarks by Al Gore May 26, 2004 As Prepared  George W. Bush promised us a foreign policy with humility. Instead, he has brought us humiliation in the eyes of the world.  He promised to "restore honor and integrity to the White House." Instead, he has brought deep dishonor to our country and built a durable reputation as the most dishonest President since Richard Nixon.  Honor? He decided not to honor the Geneva Convention. Just as he would not honor the United Nations, international treaties, the opinions of our allies, the role of Congress and the courts, or what Jefferson described as "a decent respect for the opinion of mankind." He did not honor the advice, experience and judgment of our military leaders in designing his invasion of Iraq. And now he will not honor our fallen dead by attending any funerals or even by permitting photos of their flag-draped coffins.  How did we get from September 12th , 2001, when a leading French newspaper ran a giant headline with the words "We Are All Americans Now" and when we had the good will and empathy of all the world -- to the horror that we all felt in witnessing the pictures of torture in Abu Ghraib.  To begin with, from its earliest days in power, this administration sought to radically destroy the foreign policy consensus that had guided America since the end of World War II. The long successful strategy of containment was abandoned in favor of the new strategy of "preemption." And what they meant by preemption was not the inherent right of any nation to act preemptively against an imminent threat to its national security, but rather an exotic new approach that asserted a unique and unilateral U.S. right to ignore international law wherever it wished to do so and take military action against any nation, even in circumstances where there was no imminent threat. All that is required, in the view of Bush's team is the mere assertion of a possible, future threat - and the assertion need be made by only one person, the President.  More disturbing still was their frequent use of the word "dominance" to describe their strategic goal, because an American policy of dominance is as repugnant to the rest of the world as the ugly dominance of the helpless, naked Iraqi prisoners has been to the American people. Dominance is as dominance does.  Dominance is not really a strategic policy or political philosophy at all. It is a seductive illusion that tempts the powerful to satiate their hunger for more power still by striking a Faustian bargain. And as always happens - sooner or later - to those who shake hands with the devil, they find out too late that what they have given up in the bargain is their soul.  One of the clearest indications of the impending loss of intimacy with one's soul is the failure to recognize the existence of a soul in those over whom power is exercised, especially if the helpless come to be treated as animals, and degraded. We also know - and not just from De Sade and Freud - the psychological proximity between sexual depravity and other people's pain. It has been especially shocking and awful to see these paired evils perpetrated so crudely and cruelly in the name of America.  Those pictures of torture and sexual abuse came to us embedded in a wave of news about escalating casualties and growing chaos enveloping our entire policy in Iraq. But in order understand the failure of our overall policy, it is important to focus specifically on what happened in the Abu Ghraib prison, and ask whether or not those actions were representative of who we are as Americans? Obviously the quick answer is no, but unfortunately it's more complicated than that.  There is good and evil in every person. And what makes the United States special in the history of nations is our commitment to the rule of law and our carefully constructed system of checks and balances. Our natural distrust of concentrated power and our devotion to openness and democracy are what have lead us as a people to consistently choose good over evil in our collective aspirations more than the people any other nation.  Our founders were insightful students of human nature. They feared the abuse of power because they understood that every human being has not only "better angels" in his nature, but also an innate vulnerability to temptation - especially the temptation to abuse power over others.  Our founders understood full well that a system of checks and balances is needed in our constitution because every human being lives with an internal system of checks and balances that cannot be relied upon to produce virtue if they are allowed to attain an unhealthy degree of power over their fellow citizens.  Listen then to the balance of internal impulses described by specialist Charles Graner when confronted by one of his colleagues, Specialist Joseph M. Darby, who later became a courageous whistleblower. When Darby asked him to explain his actions documented in the photos, Graner replied: "The Christian in me says it's wrong, but the Corrections Officer says, 'I love to make a groan man piss on himself."  What happened at the prison, it is now clear, was not the result of random acts by "a few bad apples," it was the natural consequence of the Bush Administration policy that has dismantled those wise constraints and has made war on America's checks and balances.  The abuse of the prisoners at Abu Ghraib flowed directly from the abuse of the truth that characterized the Administration's march to war and the abuse of the trust that had been placed in President Bush by the American people in the aftermath of September 11th.  There was then, there is now and there would have been regardless of what Bush did, a threat of terrorism that we would have to deal with. But instead of making it better, he has made it infinitely worse. We are less safe because of his policies. He has created more anger and righteous indignation against us as Americans than any leader of our country in the 228 years of our existence as a nation -- because of his attitude of contempt for any person, institution or nation who disagrees with him.  He has exposed Americans abroad and Americans in every U.S. town and city to a greater danger of attack by terrorists because of his arrogance, willfulness, and bungling at stirring up hornet's nests that pose no threat whatsoever to us. And by then insulting the religion and culture and tradition of people in other countries. And by pursuing policies that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children, all of it done in our name.  President Bush said in his speech Monday night that the war in Iraq is "the central front in the war on terror." It's not the central front in the war on terror, but it has unfortunately become the central recruiting office for terrorists. [Dick Cheney said, "This war may last the rest of our lives.] The unpleasant truth is that President Bush's utter incompetence has made the world a far more dangerous place and dramatically increased the threat of terrorism against the United States. Just yesterday, the International Institute of Strategic Studies reported that the Iraq conflict " has arguable focused the energies and resources of Al Qaeda and its followers while diluting those of the global counterterrorism coalition." The ISS said that in the wake of the war in Iraq Al Qaeda now has more than 18,000 potential terrorists scattered around the world and the war in Iraq is swelling its ranks.  The war plan was incompetent in its rejection of the advice from military professionals and the analysis of the intelligence was incompetent in its conclusion that our soldiers would be welcomed with garlands of flowers and cheering crowds. Thus we would not need to respect the so-called Powell doctrine of overwhelming force.  There was also in Rumsfeld's planning a failure to provide security for nuclear materials, and to prevent widespread lawlessness and looting.  Luckily, there was a high level of competence on the part of our soldiers even though they were denied the tools and the numbers they needed for their mission. What a disgrace that their families have to hold bake sales to buy discarded Kevlar vests to stuff into the floorboards of the Humvees! Bake sales for body armor.  And the worst still lies ahead. General Joseph Hoar, the former head of the Marine Corps, said "I believe we are absolutely on the brink of failure. We are looking into the abyss."  When a senior, respected military leader like Joe Hoar uses the word "abyss", then the rest of us damn well better listen. Here is what he means: more American soldiers dying, Iraq slipping into worse chaos and violence, no end in sight, with our influence and moral authority seriously damaged.  Retired Marine Corps General Anthony Zinni, who headed Central Command before becoming President Bush's personal emissary to the Middle East, said recently that our nation's current course is "headed over Niagara Falls."  The Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division, Army Major General Charles H. Swannack, Jr., asked by the Washington Post whether he believes the United States is losing the war in Iraq, replied, "I think strategically, we are." Army Colonel Paul Hughes, who directed strategic planning for the US occupation authority in Baghdad, compared what he sees in Iraq to the Vietnam War, in which he lost his brother: "I promised myself when I came on active duty that I would do everything in my power to prevent that ... from happening again. " Noting that Vietnam featured a pattern of winning battles while losing the war, Hughes added "unless we ensure that we have coherence in our policy, we will lose strategically."  The White House spokesman, Dan Bartlett was asked on live television about these scathing condemnations by Generals involved in the highest levels of Pentagon planning and he replied, "Well they're retired, and we take our advice from active duty officers."  But amazingly, even active duty military officers are speaking out against President Bush. For example, the Washington Post quoted an unnamed senior General at the Pentagon as saying, " the current OSD (Office of the Secretary of Defense) refused to listen or adhere to military advice." Rarely if ever in American history have uniformed commanders felt compelled to challenge their commander in chief in public.  The Post also quoted an unnamed general as saying, "Like a lot of senior Army guys I'm quite angry" with Rumsfeld and the rest of the Bush Administration. He listed two reasons. "I think they are going to break the Army," he said, adding that what really incites him is "I don't think they care."  In his upcoming book, Zinni blames the current catastrophe on the Bush team's incompetence early on. "In the lead-up to the Iraq war, and its later conduct," he writes, "I saw at a minimum, true dereliction, negligence and irresponsibility, at worst, lying, incompetence and corruption."  Zinni's book will join a growing library of volumes by former advisors to Bush -- including his principal advisor on terrorism, Richard Clarke; his principal economic policy advisor, former Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill, former Ambassador Joe Wilson, who was honored by Bush's father for his service in Iraq, and his former Domestic Adviser on faith-based organizations, John Dilulio, who said, "There is no precedent in any modern White House for what is going on in this one: a complete lack of a policy apparatus. What you've got is everything, and I mean everything, run by the political arm. It's the reign of the Mayberry Machiavellis."  Army Chief of Staff General Eric Shinseki told Congress in February that the occupation could require "several hundred thousand troops." But because Rumsfeld and Bush did not want to hear disagreement with their view that Iraq could be invaded at a much lower cost, Shinseki was hushed and then forced out.  And as a direct result of this incompetent plan and inadequate troop strength, young soldiers were put in an untenable position. For example, young reservists assigned to the Iraqi prisons were called up without training or adequate supervision, and were instructed by their superiors to "break down" prisoners in order to prepare them for interrogation.  To make matters worse, they were placed in a confusing situation where the chain of command was criss-crossed between intelligence gathering and prison administration, and further confused by an unprecedented mixing of military and civilian contractor authority.  The soldiers who are accused of committing these atrocities are, of course, responsible for their own actions and if found guilty, must be severely and appropriately punished. But they are not the ones primarily responsible for the disgrace that has been brought upon the United States of America.  Private Lynndie England did not make the decision that the United States would not observe the Geneva Convention. Specialist Charles Graner was not the one who approved a policy of establishing an American Gulag of dark rooms with naked prisoners to be "stressed" and even - we must use the word - tortured - to force them to say things that legal procedures might not induce them to say.  These policies were designed and insisted upon by the Bush White House. Indeed, the President's own legal counsel advised him specifically on the subject. His secretary of defense and his assistants pushed these cruel departures from historic American standards over the objections of the uniformed military, just as the Judge Advocates General within the Defense Department were so upset and opposed that they took the unprecedented step of seeking help from a private lawyer in this city who specializes in human rights and said to him, "There is a calculated effort to create an atmosphere of legal ambiguity" where the mistreatment of prisoners is concerned."  Indeed, the secrecy of the program indicates an understanding that the regular military culture and mores would not support these activities and neither would the American public or the world community. Another implicit acknowledgement of violations of accepted standards of behavior is the process of farming out prisoners to countries less averse to torture and giving assignments to private contractors  President Bush set the tone for our attitude for suspects in his State of the Union address. He noted that more than 3,000 "suspected terrorists" had been arrested in many countries and then he added, "and many others have met a different fate. Let's put it this way: they are no longer a problem to the United States and our allies."  George Bush promised to change the tone in Washington. And indeed he did. As many as 37 prisoners may have been murdered while in captivity, though the numbers are difficult to rely upon because in many cases involving violent death, there were no autopsies.  How dare they blame their misdeeds on enlisted personnel from a Reserve unit in upstate New York. President Bush owes more than one apology. On the list of those he let down are the young soldiers who are themselves apparently culpable, but who were clearly put into a moral cesspool. The perpetrators as well as the victims were both placed in their relationship to one another by the policies of George W. Bush.  How dare the incompetent and willful members of this Bush/Cheney Administration humiliate our nation and our people in the eyes of the world and in the conscience of our own people. How dare they subject us to such dishonor and disgrace. How dare they drag the good name of the United States of America through the mud of Saddam Hussein's torture prison.  David Kay concluded his search for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq with the famous verdict: "we were all wrong." And for many Americans, Kay's statement seemed to symbolize the awful collision between Reality and all of the false and fading impressions President Bush had fostered in building support for his policy of going to war.  Now the White House has informed the American people that they were also "all wrong" about their decision to place their faith in Ahmed Chalabi, even though they have paid him 340,000 dollars per month. 33 million dollars (CHECK) and placed him adjacent to Laura Bush at the State of the Union address. Chalabi had been convicted of fraud and embezzling 70 million dollars in public funds from a Jordanian bank, and escaped prison by fleeing the country. But in spite of that record, he had become one of key advisors to the Bush Administration on planning and promoting the War against Iraq.  And they repeatedly cited him as an authority, perhaps even a future president of Iraq. Incredibly, they even ferried him and his private army into Baghdad in advance of anyone else, and allowed him to seize control over Saddam's secret papers.  Now they are telling the American people that he is a spy for Iran who has been duping the President of the United States for all these years.  One of the Generals in charge of this war policy went on a speaking tour in his spare time to declare before evangelical groups that the US is in a holy war as "Christian Nation battling Satan." This same General Boykin was the person who ordered the officer who was in charge of the detainees in Guantanamo Bay to extend his methods to Iraq detainees, prisoners. ... The testimony from the prisoners is that they were forced to curse their religion Bush used the word "crusade" early on in the war against Iraq, and then commentators pointed out that it was singularly inappropriate because of the history and sensitivity of the Muslim world and then a few weeks later he used it again.  "We are now being viewed as the modern Crusaders, as the modern colonial power in this part of the world," Zinni said.  What a terrible irony that our country, which was founded by refugees seeking religious freedom - coming to America to escape domineering leaders who tried to get them to renounce their religion - would now be responsible for this kind of abuse..  Ameen Saeed al-Sheikh told the Washington Post that he was tortured and ordered to denounce Islam and after his leg was broken one of his torturers started hitting it while ordering him to curse Islam and then, " they ordered me to thank Jesus that I'm alive." Others reported that they were forced to eat pork and drink alcohol.  In my religious tradition, I have been taught that "ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit... Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them."  The President convinced a majority of the country that Saddam Hussein was responsible for attacking us on September 11th. But in truth he had nothing whatsoever to do with it. The President convinced the country with a mixture of forged documents and blatantly false assertions that Saddam was in league with Al Qaeda, and that he was "indistinguishable" from Osama bin Laden.  He asked the nation , in his State of the Union address, to "imagine" how terrified we should be that Saddam was about to give nuclear weapons to terrorists and stated repeatedly that Iraq posed a grave and gathering threat to our nation. He planted the seeds of war, and harvested a whirlwind. And now, the "corrupt tree" of a war waged on false premises has brought us the "evil fruit" of Americans torturing and humiliating prisoners.  In my opinion, John Kerry is dealing with this unfolding tragedy in an impressive and extremely responsible way. Our nation's best interest lies in having a new president who can turn a new page, sweep clean with a new broom, and take office on January 20th of next year with the ability to make a fresh assessment of exactly what our nation's strategic position is as of the time the reigns of power are finally wrested from the group of incompetents that created this catastrophe.  Kerry should not tie his own hands by offering overly specific, detailed proposals concerning a situation that is rapidly changing and unfortunately, rapidly deteriorating, but should rather preserve his, and our country's, options, to retrieve our national honor as soon as this long national nightmare is over.  Eisenhower did not propose a five-point plan for changing America's approach to the Korean War when he was running for president in 1952.  When a business enterprise finds itself in deep trouble that is linked to the failed policies of the current CEO the board of directors and stockholders usually say to the failed CEO, "Thank you very much, but we're going to replace you now with a new CEO -- one less vested in a stubborn insistence on staying the course, even if that course is, in the words of General Zinni, "Headed over Niagara Falls."  One of the strengths of democracy is the ability of the people to regularly demand changes in leadership and to fire a failing leader and hire a new one with the promise of hopeful change. That is the real solution to America's quagmire in Iraq. But, I am keenly aware that we have seven months and twenty five days remaining in this president's current term of office and that represents a time of dangerous vulnerability for our country because of the demonstrated incompetence and recklessness of the current administration.  It is therefore essential that even as we focus on the fateful choice, the voters must make this November that we simultaneously search for ways to sharply reduce the extraordinary danger that we face with the current leadership team in place. It is for that reason that I am calling today for Republicans as well as Democrats to join me in asking for the immediate resignations of those immediately below George Bush and Dick Cheney who are most responsible for creating the catastrophe that we are facing in Iraq.  We desperately need a national security team with at least minimal competence because the current team is making things worse with each passing day. They are endangering the lives of our soldiers, and sharply increasing the danger faced by American citizens everywhere in the world, including here at home. They are enraging hundreds of millions of people and embittering an entire generation of anti-Americans whose rage is already near the boiling point.  We simply cannot afford to further increase the risk to our country with more blunders by this team. Donald Rumsfeld, as the chief architect of the war plan, should resign today. His deputies Paul Wolfowitz, Douglas Feith and his intelligence chief Stephen Cambone should also resign. The nation is especially at risk every single day that Rumsfeld remains as Secretary of Defense.  Condoleeza Rice, who has badly mishandled the coordination of national security policy, should also resign immediately.  George Tenet should also resign. I want to offer a special word about George Tenet, because he is a personal friend and I know him to be a good and decent man. It is especially painful to call for his resignation, but I have regretfully concluded that it is extremely important that our country have new leadership at the CIA immediately.  As a nation, our greatest export has always been hope: hope that through the rule of law people can be free to pursue their dreams, that democracy can supplant repression and that justice, not power, will be the guiding force in society. Our moral authority in the world derived from the hope anchored in the rule of law. With this blatant failure of the rule of law from the very agents of our government, we face a great challenge in restoring our moral authority in the world and demonstrating our commitment to bringing a better life to our global neighbors.  During Ronald Reagan's Presidency, Secretary of Labor Ray Donovan was accused of corruption, but eventually, after a lot of publicity, the indictment was thrown out by the Judge. Donovan asked the question, "Where do I go to get my reputation back?" President Bush has now placed the United States of America in the same situation. Where do we go to get our good name back?  The answer is, we go where we always go when a dramatic change is needed. We go to the ballot box, and we make it clear to the rest of the world that what's been happening in America for the last four years, and what America has been doing in Iraq for the last two years, really is not who we are. We, as a people, at least the overwhelming majority of us, do not endorse the decision to dishonor the Geneva Convention and the Bill of Rights....  Make no mistake, the damage done at Abu Ghraib is not only to America's reputation and America's strategic interests, but also to America's spirit. It is also crucial for our nation to recognize - and to recognize quickly - that the damage our nation has suffered in the world is far, far more serious than President Bush's belated and tepid response would lead people to believe. Remember how shocked each of us, individually, was when we first saw those hideous images. The natural tendency was to first recoil from the images, and then to assume that they represented a strange and rare aberration that resulted from a few twisted minds or, as the Pentagon assured us, "a few bad apples."  But as today's shocking news reaffirms yet again, this was not rare. It was not an aberration. Today's New York Times reports that an Army survey of prisoner deaths and mistreatment in Iraq and Afghanisatan "show a widespread pattern of abuse involving more military units than previously known.'  Nor did these abuses spring from a few twisted minds at the lowest ranks of our military enlisted personnel. No, it came from twisted values and atrocious policies at the highest levels of our government. This was done in our name, by our leaders.  These horrors were the predictable consequence of policy choices that flowed directly from this administration's contempt for the rule of law. And the dominance they have been seeking is truly not simply unworthy of America - it is also an illusory goal in its own right.  Our world is unconquerable because the human spirit is unconquerable, and any national strategy based on pursuing the goal of domination is doomed to fail because it generates its own opposition, and in the process, creates enemies for the would-be dominator.  A policy based on domination of the rest of the world not only creates enemies for the United States and creates recruits for Al Qaeda, it also undermines the international cooperation that is essential to defeating the efforts of terrorists who wish harm and intimidate Americans.  Unilateralism, as we have painfully seen in Iraq, is its own reward. Going it alone may satisfy a political instinct but it is dangerous to our military, even without their Commander in Chief taunting terrorists to "bring it on."  Our troops are stretched thin and exhausted not only because Secretary Rumsfeld contemptuously dismissed the advice of military leaders on the size of the needed force - but also because President Bush's contempt for traditional allies and international opinion left us without a real coalition to share the military and financial burden of the war and the occupation. Our future is dependent upon increasing cooperation and interdependence in a world tied ever more closely together by technologies of communications and travel. The emergence of a truly global civilization has been accompanied by the recognition of truly global challenges that require global responses that, as often as not, can only be led by the United States - and only if the United States restores and maintains its moral authority to lead.  Make no mistake, it is precisely our moral authority that is our greatest source of strength, and it is precisely our moral authority that has been recklessly put at risk by the cheap calculations and mean compromises of conscience wagered with history by this willful president.  Listen to the way Israel's highest court dealt with a similar question when, in 1999, it was asked to balance due process rights against dire threats to the security of its people:  "This is the destiny of democracy, as not all means are acceptable to it, and not all practices employed by its enemies are open before it. Although a democracy must often fight with one hand tied behind its back, it nonetheless has the upper hand. Preserving the Rule of Law and recognition of an individual's liberty constitutes an important component in its understanding of security. At the end of the day they (add to) its strength."  The last and best description of America's meaning in the world is still the definitive formulation of Lincoln's annual message to Congress on December 1, 1862:  "The occasion is piled high with difficulty, and we must rise - with the occasion. As our case is new, so we must think anew, and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country. Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history...the fiery trial through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation...We shall nobly save, or meanly lose the last best hope of earth...The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just - a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless."  It is now clear that their obscene abuses of the truth and their unforgivable abuse of the trust placed in them after 9/11 by the American people led directly to the abuses of the prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison and, we are now learning, in many other similar facilities constructed as part of Bush's Gulag, in which, according to the Red Cross, 70 to 90 percent of the victims are totally innocent of any wrongdoing.  The same dark spirit of domination has led them to - for the first time in American history - imprison American citizens with no charges, no right to see a lawyer, no right to notify their family, no right to know of what they are accused, and no right to gain access to any court to present an appeal of any sort. The Bush Admistration has even acquired the power to compel librarians to tell them what any American is reading, and to compel them to keep silent about the request - or else the librarians themselves can also be imprisoned.  They have launched an unprecedented assault on civil liberties, on the right of the courts to review their actions, on the right of the Congress to have information to how they are spending the public's money and the right of the news media to have information about the policies they are pursuing.  The same pattern characterizes virtually all of their policies. They resent any constraint as an insult to their will to dominate and exercise power. Their appetite for power is astonishing. It has led them to introduce a new level of viciousness in partisan politics. It is that viciousness that led them to attack as unpatriotic, Senator Max Cleland, who lost three limbs in combat during the Vietnam War.  The president episodically poses as a healer and "uniter". If he president really has any desire to play that role, then I call upon him to condemn Rush Limbaugh - perhaps his strongest political supporter - who said that the torture in Abu Ghraib was a "brilliant maneuver" and that the photos were "good old American pornography," and that the actions portrayed were simply those of "people having a good time and needing to blow off steam."  This new political viciousness by the President and his supporters is found not only on the campaign trail, but in the daily operations of our democracy. They have insisted that the leaders of their party in the Congress deny Democrats any meaningful role whatsoever in shaping legislation, debating the choices before us as a people, or even to attend the all-important conference committees that reconcile the differences between actions by the Senate and House of Representatives.  The same meanness of spirit shows up in domestic policies as well. Under the Patriot Act, Muslims, innocent of any crime, were picked up, often physically abused, and held incommunicado indefinitely. What happened in Abu Ghraib was difference not of kind, but of degree.  Differences of degree are important when the subject is torture. The apologists for what has happened do have points that should be heard and clearly understood. It is a fact that every culture and every politics sometimes expresses itself in cruelty. It is also undeniably true that other countries have and do torture more routinely, and far more brutally, than ours has. George Orwell once characterized life in Stalin's Russia as "a boot stamping on a human face forever." That was the ultimate culture of cruelty, so ingrained, so organic, so systematic that everyone in it lived in terror, even the terrorizers. And that was the nature and degree of state cruelty in Saddam Hussein's Iraq.  We all know these things, and we need not reassure ourselves and should not congratulate ourselves that our society is less cruel than some others, although it is worth noting that there are many that are less cruel than ours. And this searing revelation at Abu Ghraib should lead us to examine more thoroughly the routine horrors in our domestic prison system.  But what we do now, in reaction to Abu Ghraib will determine a great deal about who we are at the beginning of the 21st century. It is important to note that just as the abuses of the prisoners flowed directly from the policies of the Bush White House, those policies flowed not only from the instincts of the president and his advisors, but found support in shifting attitudes on the part of some in our country in response to the outrage and fear generated by the attack of September 11th.  The president exploited and fanned those fears, but some otherwise sensible and levelheaded Americans fed them as well. I remember reading genteel-sounding essays asking publicly whether or not the prohibitions against torture were any longer relevant or desirable. The same grotesque misunderstanding of what is really involved was responsible for the tone in the memo from the president's legal advisor, Alberto Gonzalez, who wrote on January 25, 2002, that 9/11 "renders obsolete Geneva's strict limitations on questioning of enemy prisoners and renders quaint some of its provisions."  We have seen the pictures. We have learned the news. We cannot unlearn it; it is part of us. The important question now is, what will we do now about torture. Stop it? Yes, of course. But that means demanding all of the facts, not covering them up, as some now charge the administration is now doing. One of the whistleblowers at Abu Ghraib, Sergeant Samuel Provance, told ABC News a few days ago that he was being intimidated and punished for telling the truth. "There is definitely a coverup," Provance said. "I feel like I am being punished for being honest."  The abhorrent acts in the prison were a direct consequence of the culture of impunity encouraged, authorized and instituted by Bush and Rumsfeld in their statements that the Geneva Conventions did not apply. The apparent war crimes that took place were the logical, inevitable outcome of policies and statements from the administration.  To me, as glaring as the evidence of this in the pictures themselves was the revelation that it was established practice for prisoners to be moved around during ICRC visits so that they would not be available for visits. That, no one can claim, was the act of individuals. That was policy set from above with the direct intention to violate US values it was to be upholding. It was the kind of policy we see - and criticize in places like China and Cuba.  Moreover, the administration has also set up the men and women of our own armed forces for payback the next time they are held as prisoners. And for that, this administration should pay a very high price. One of the most tragic consequences of these official crimes is that it will be very hard for any of us as Americans - at least for a very long time - to effectively stand up for human rights elsewhere and criticize other governments, when our policies have resulted in our soldiers behaving so monstrously. This administration has shamed America and deeply damaged the cause of freedom and human rights everywhere, thus undermining the core message of America to the world.  President Bush offered a brief and half-hearted apology to the Arab world - but he should apologize to the American people for abandoning the Geneva Conventions. He also owes an apology to the U.S. Army for cavalierly sending them into harm's way while ignoring the best advice of their commanders. Perhaps most importantly of all, he should apologize to all those men and women throughout our world who have held the ideal of the United States of America as a shining goal, to inspire their hopeful efforts to bring about justice under a rule of law in their own lands. Of course, the problem with all these legitimate requests is that a sincere apology requires an admission of error, a willingness to accept responsibility and to hold people accountable. And President Bush is not only unwilling to acknowledge error. He has thus far been unwilling to hold anyone in his administration accountable for the worst strategic and military miscalculations and mistakes in the history of the United States of America.  He is willing only to apologize for the alleged erratic behavior of a few low-ranking enlisted people, who he is scapegoating for his policy fiasco.  In December of 2000, even though I strongly disagreed with the decision by the U.S. Supreme Court to order a halt to the counting of legally cast ballots, I saw it as my duty to reaffirm my own strong belief that we are a nation of laws and not only accept the decision, but do what I could to prevent efforts to delegitimize George Bush as he took the oath of office as president.  I did not at that moment imagine that Bush would, in the presidency that ensued, demonstrate utter contempt for the rule of law and work at every turn to frustrate accountability...  So today, I want to speak on behalf of those Americans who feel that President Bush has betrayed our nation's trust, those who are horrified at what has been done in our name, and all those who want the rest of the world to know that we Americans see the abuses that occurred in the prisons of Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo and secret locations as yet undisclosed as completely out of keeping with the character and basic nature of the American people and at odds with the principles on which America stands.  I believe we have a duty to hold President Bush accountable - and I believe we will. As Lincoln said at our time of greatest trial, "We - even we here - hold the power, and bear the responsibility."i just found out today that i am supposed to be in work at 7:30am! oh well, ill get here at 7:30am tommorow. im not fired, so i suppose its all good. silly me.so now, i got the site running. and yeah im using a dumb template in the meantime, but im gonna do some funny stuff with this site. i created so i can vent my creative side. but stay tuned ill get the ball rolling.They deleted my stuff!!!!!! *sigh* i guess when they did the conversion from www.david.gs to www.ninjaturdles.com my stuff got deleted!here is a link to the playlist im listening to now. you need to download rhapsody to check it out.   urlLink RHAPSODY Linkthere is so much to do today. my back hurts and im tired. i have a test on wednesday. i have to bust some major bootie this morning and the rest of the day to feel comfortable about the test. the test is open book, but you know how those test are. they tend to be the hardest. so, ok. as for the site. don't expect much out of if other than a blog till after this summer session is over with. maybe july 5th. is when i will start working on my ninjaturdles. but as for now, its just a blog. anyways, have a good one and wish me luck.sorry about not updating as fast i should, but ive been pretty busy with summer school session 1. its got me ited for time. and yeah, you know me im here studing. but oh what i was wanting to share with you guys is that if you need some really good studing/motivation music listen to the cd "Run Lola Run" i mean its got a beat that is continous and and seems to never end but its great for pumping you u pto do something.    anyways, have a good one. back to studing.well sort of. im inheriting my grandmothers house for the time being.

Then we played charades which is rele funny and then Drew came and picked up Allison an Kate.  I didn't do my spanish reading, i read about 3 of 15 pages.  That swing is too comfy, and it rocks a little so it's like ok u cant read like that.  The story I'm reading is boring too.  But i decided i will finish reading it tonite and do the questions tomorrow.  even if i have to stay up rele late. i mean how long can it take? 1 hour at the most...if it even takes that long (hopefully not).  who gets homework over vayk neway? cmon ppls.  and ok y is it getting hot out?  it was like in the 80s today!  isnt january sposed to b cold? sheesh.  cmon, pls b cold. cold is good. i promise!Hi.  Well today was pretty boring, my friends went to see Catch Me If You Can and I already saw it.  I would have gone anyway, but I was really sleepy and I would have had to get up right then to be ready on time, so I didn't really want to.  Well so far I've done chores and showered and watched TV, and after this i will have blogged.  I'm listening to this awesome song in Spanish that we played yest in the car.  It was great cuz it was me with my 4 guy cuzins and they were all singing along, and theres a part where it goes "VIDA!" (Means "life" and its talking to a girl like saying shes his life) and its like, the music builds up to it and then he like shouts it, and they wud all shout it with him.  It was really cute and funny, my cousins rock.  :( No one can do anything today.  We got a swing in the backyard, one of those long bench ones, so I wanted to have people over so we could hang out back there, it's awesome.  But yeah no one can...well maybe Alyssa can come chill for a while after church I'm going to call her and see, but my guess is she cant.  That's about it for today.  I'm still putting off my HW, maybe ill go out on the swing and do the rest of my spanish reading. That works...:( my cousins just left... I know it's late but they had to go cuz my uncle has to be there at 5am.  I'm sad...we were *bonding* :'(. Well my youngest guy cuzin (hes like 2 months older than me) came in and we were like talking about like...just a lot of stuff and then my next youngest cousin (just turned 20 but duznt act it....hehehe) came in and laid on the bed and added a few things to the convo and sometimes just grunted and made weird noises lol funny funny.  but yeah finally we got to talking and stuff and now I'm not going to see him for like 6 months.  gosh i love my cousins though.  they are so great...i'm really going to miss them.  what I said before about feeling out of place...yeah its kind of true, but when its just me and them its really nice and i feel really loved.  still though i think what i said about friends is true..theyre the ones i can totally be myself around and not worry about sounding stupid and stuff.  but still...theres something about these guys that makes me really happy and now im so sad because theyre gone and who knows when i will c them again?  im glad i have my friends :) though, i guess cousins and friends are both good in different ways.  gosh i swear im so corny but i gotta say wut im feeling so... it feels like this is a good ending though, like before i was kind of disappointed as u cud tell, like i was like why do i have so much fun with my cousins when most of the time i feel left out?  but now this time i remembered why i have such great memories of them, because they really are great. im glad, bcuz i was rele sad about that.  hmm. i think thats all for now.  g'night ppls (yeah at 3:16am.... ooo John 3:16 For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son that none would perish but have everlasting life.  OK that doesnt sound right but i got the main idea. good verse tho.)http://community.webshots.com/photo/18087014/18087123kCxiNeZafS ........ mommy i think i found the closest thing to heaven here on earth...:)Hahaha... I had a WONDERFUL convo with my cousins over dinner.  It was ALL ABOUT POO.  Size... how often... "overflow" stories...ok just so you know I wasn't talking much, mostly listening and laughing.

I just needa like see him and figure out wtf is going thru his head.Why does it seem like no one in this family really cares how I feel?  I mean I don't want like everyone as my servant but it just seems like my opinion never counts and I'm always putting up with sh!t so other ppl have fun and do what they want to.

Oh and to me its still Jan 2 but its a little past midnight so its going under Jan 3...TRYING TO DECIDE ON TODAYS MOOD    Good things: I had a ton of fun at the party.  It's January 1st, 2003.  I have awesome friends.  My family is cool.  I have a job, very fun and easy (taking care of a puppy).  I smell good (So Pink from GAP).  I'm wearing my fav pants.  I like my hair today.  I laugh like I'm insane, and it's FUN.  We scare people.  It's warm outside.  My room is clean.  I'm stupid. And so are my friends :-P.  The doorbell just rang.    Bad things: I feel stoned or wasted...or both.  I'm sleepy.  I'm bored.  I must have gained 10 pounds last night. I look pale enough to be a ghost.  I did my makeup before putting in my contacts so I have to wear glasses today.  I can't find my bunny (aka my cat).  I didn't have neone special (a guy) to spend the holidays with.  I have homework to do (Spanish Lit and World Lit...agh its like all reading). It's warm outside.  No one's online.  I have time to make this list.WOW...I'm like so wasted right now.  And all I had was junk food.  We are so good, we went to sleep at like, 8, 8:30-ish!  We went outside and watched the sunrise too.  OK here is how the night went.  I got to Island's after everyone else cuz of my crazy insane day I talked about already.  So I get there and had my BIG WAVE BURGER i had been craving like FOREVER and wow we had some problems figuring out the bill but thx to allison our smart math person we did alright.  then we walked to starbucks (with kate talking about random things making me crack up "i dont eat pumpkins...they dont fit in my mouth") and then we got frapps and my daddy picked us up.  then we came back to my house and just hung out and had all these "deep" talks not rele deep hehe but more like just talks but it was kinda "stuff i only say in a close group of friends" talk but yeah it was just weird but interesting.  i found out lots of new info yay go me.  then we went to watch DUDE WHERES MY CAR (kate thx so much for taping that!) and I AM IN LOVE WITH ASHTON KUTCHER meg can totally have Sean william scott ill take ashton over him any day. ("...all rugged like ASHTON KUTCHER..." Meagan on Wakeup Wakefield-SNL).  Well that movie is like hilarious but incredibly strange.  Then we just hung out for a while, watched the MTV performances (avril!) and looked at magazines, went online, all that good stuff.  Then my poor kitty ran out of the room and I realized that him being the biggest scaredy cat ever he must have been terrified with 6 screaming girls in the room so I went and got him and put him in my sweatshirt and just hung out with him for a while.  poor little boy!  and then like i went back to the room and they were like "oo its 11:54!!" and i was like no that clocks ahead its not that late (cuz we have a clock thats an hour ahead) and theyre like no this is the tv clock and i was like WHOA how did time fly so fast?  so me and diane went downstairs to get the Martinelli's (pshh can u say trouble opening a bottle?? lol) and she served it up being the excellent bartender she is and we took it upstairs and counted down like the dorks we r.  then we screamed HAPPY NEW YEARS (feeling rele stupid, well i was neway) and "kissed" and YES the quotes r there for a reason. then we watched tv a little more (THIRD ROCK!) and all that good stuff until my parents company left and my parents went to bed, so we went downstairs.  we talked like forever, and then got bored and started playing things like monster chase, piggy back and horsey back races, watch diane pretend to be a guy and hit on arleen (haha we had a good time with this one), and all these random things.  ok so by now its like...4 maybe?  so we're like ok its late but were rele not sleepy so we start playing charades and its like were so insane and we're horrible at it! (sleepy sh!t, haha) like we wud say things that wud make NO sense and it was...rele entertaining.  so around 6:30 we decide to head out and see the sunrise but its pretty much already risen so we just froze and huddled under one blanket and watched the sky get brighter.  we came back in and decided to "chill" a little but by then laying down felt good.  so diane, kate and allison keep on playing charades and me and meg and leslie r watching some of them and guessing and sometimes just laying there, and around 8:30 i fell asleep for a couple hours but from what i hear, kate, diane and allison had a BIT of fun while we were asleep...lol. so then we wake up and them 3 r coming downstairs and theyre all ready to leave :( so i say byebyezies to them and we decide to head on upstairs.  then meg and leslie got picked up and that was the end. ooo..and SO much eating went on last night...im hungry but i feel too sick too have breakfast.  so yeah, now we were sitting around like all stoned and wasted (from sugar haha) and like my voice was SO deep and i was so like expressionless and out of it..wow. ok the end...happy new years guys.  i havent had a chance to try out my resolution but i already know one person im going to try it wth...so yeah.  i will let the blog know what happened so he can tell all of u :).  well this is like way long and u r all bored to death so yeah...i will let u ppls go. *STONED*Hey well this is Meggie at the computer right now...hmm what to say what to say...oh!

Sheesh- WHOA now we're talkin about thongs and how they are vital to the female wardrobe (yeah, this isn't a disturbing conversation) "don't you wanna sex me up??"-Leslie Tenny...Wow, everyone here is very amusing...Arleen has a leapoard print bedspread everyone...that's pretty damn cool. OH, btw-I have a blog, www.WillTheRealDianePleaseSTandUP.com so check it out...yeah- well, as much fun as it is watching Leslie dress up as a hooker, I better go...Happy NEw YEar's everyone! The Infamous DIaneOK, well quick blog on New Years Eve...tonite is the big partay!  I'll probably come on here and write some more, and have my friends write some stuff (maybe).  Gosh crazy day today, woke up (barely slept, ahh my back, my legs, my hips hurt SO BAD :'(...) ate, showered, and went to run errands with my daddy.  Well I got to drive but that also means be yelled at and criticized on every mistake...o well I guess I have to put up with it.  Well so we went all over grocery shopping and stuff, because we're having two parties at my house tonite, mine (upstairs) and theirs (downstairs) fun fun fun stuff eh!  well 3 ppl still need to RSVP but i think 2 r on vayk...and i owe the library $12, plus i have to send out my xmas cards (a little late but o well)...oh and we forgot to get milk. fun stuff huh?? ok, my new years resolution (so far my only one i rele wanna publish): to be more upfront and honest with people because it just makes better relationships and a lot of the time the truth hurts but its way better to know... ok i think im done preaching :)MMM...I'm bored...I'm chatting with some guys but theyre on BRB, and I'm on the fone with my friend Meggie who is falling asleep... OK who actually reads my blog?  LOL...besides the Meggie..let me know if u do, id rele like to know...lol lol.  Ahh ok..let me tell you about my day!  Well I woke up to Meggie on the fone and all the stuff I already wrote about happened.  Then I did my chores and showered and then Meg and Allison came over and we hung out and looked at pix on the computer.  Then we went off to the shopping center even though it was freezing and starting to get dark.  On the way allison was being weird and riding in the grass and even up a hill she wasnt sposed to..i LMAOd.  Then we ran into Chris and his ex tina (i THINK its his ex..) they were out for a walk in the park (how lovely) ooo never mind meg just told me they went to Baskin Robbins and yeah so we talked for a little and it was weird like awkward bcuz we have all been mean to her online because she was mean to our friend roni.  Well, then we realized it was RELE getting dark and we were gonna go home, but the meg needed a milkshake, so we went to jack in the box like RELE fast and got milkshakes , then we like raced home in the dark oooo mommy it was scary! jk it wasnt too bad.  then we hung out at home and waited for my daddy to come home so he cud drive them home, only instead IIII got to drive, and YAY they are alive and in one (or two) pieces :)  im a good dwiver mommy i swear! hehe then i went with my daddy to pick up dinner (rubios and KFC) and we wented home!  THE END!Haha ok, what I said about X blocking me...maybe not true.  Just now this other kid signed on and it showed that he had blocked me too, only my friend asked him and he said no, and I could still IM him, so it's probably some weird computer thing going on.  Go me!!! lol. Props to Allison and Meg for the evil old man laugh!  GREAT STUFF! We r funny no matter wut neone (aka some bleeps with with sticks up their bleeps...) says even if we're the only ones who laugh! HAHAHAHA!OK so i lose the bet i didnt come back last night.. but this morning waking up was like a horrible start.  well not morning, afternoon...but ok whatever.  Well it started out good, I got a call from a friend telling me that a person (lets call this person X..just cuz..) well X was online and I had been waiting for X to come online because I had a really important question.  Well, the program that I use lets me be on two screen names at once and because of that I figured out that X had blocked me! And I am like WTF I'm sorry but like I never did anything to this kid and now I am just mostly pissed because well yeah and kinda sad i mean i wish i at least knew why!  well ok, bleep X.  ok my other complaint is WHY ARE GUYS SUCH CRAPHEADS?  I mean ALL my friends are having guy problems and i am too.  it's hard enough finding someone worth my time (I'm not like stuck up saying I'm too good for people, but these days guys are only thinking of one thing and i dont want a guy like that) I wish you could just like read people's minds (well except people cudnt read mine hehe new rule) but ok no, i wish you could be like totally open with people.  like you meet someone new "hey youre pretty hott ur a cool kid i like u" "o well i dont like u like that sorry" THE END you dont even waste a minute on them!  or u know it turns out u both like each other so u dont go thru that whole "::giggle:: he looked at me" crap!  OK, if some of my guy friends read this it's not meant for you, because you guys are cool or else i wud like smack u :-P i think thats all i have to say for now...and a huge crap on XHmm..I finally got a blog. I always thought these online journals were pretty cool and now I have one. Gooo me.  Thats ONE good thing this weekend.  This weekend has been pretty crappy, but I'm not getting into to much detail with that..just family stuff.  And its not even big problems, so if I say why it will be a big waste of time and everyone will think I'm a spoiled brat.  But I'm really not, just when a ton of little things build up and I'm already in a crappy mood I just feel like life sucks.  Well, my cousins were visiting last week, which was fun, except that my younger one tries to act like shes way older an she duz sometimes but then she's really immature a lot of the time.  My other one is my age but he always hangs out with my bro...he's still super cool though.  My cousins are all pretty great except that younger one, and thats because she's done stuff to me.  But thats all in the past so I'm not getting into it either...I've just learned not to trust her.  Well but then my cousins left and my brother went with them (to my other cuzins house for the next week), only I'm not allowed to go bcuz theres too many guys over there and my parents are weird about that, so I'm the only one on that side of the family whos left out.  Well, me and a five year old...but that doesn't make it any better.  And my parents are treating me like the servant girl or somtin today, so that just did not help at all.  And ok, my mom asks me whats wrong, why I'm in a bad mood.  I tell her, and she refuses to believe its her fault...somtin must have happened to me.  Of course mom, cause youre the all knowing one and im just a stupid little girl.  I mean if youre going to ask me then believe me, if not dont ask!  And my parents always do that.  OK, I said no detail but it's a little late...sorry but that's what the blog is here for i guess.  So yeah, like I said it's not a big deal, just a lot of small things making me feel like I dont really matter.  But you know what I realized?  My cousins are fun, my parents are OK usually, but my friends are the people I can really count on.  I mean this week I had fun with cousins and all, but a lot of the time I felt left out and like I didnt belong, and they were all leaving without me and it was like they didnt really care.  And then yesterday I went out with my friends and it was like...coming home. Like I was where I belonged and they never make me feel like left out or anything.. Geeze, I sound so corny, I've been kinda emotional lately...i guess.  I just wish people could understand what i feel...especially the ones making me feel that way.  Well...I think I'm done for now but I can bet I'll be back later today...or very early tomorrow (aka after midnight) so until then, have fun reading... *ME*weird, meggie called me from her cell last night, it woke me up and i picked up an no one answered (but my lil screen said Meg's Cell) and then i hung up an she called back an i heard a voice in the background (sounded like Christina) go "yeah, it's really late" an i was like hello? hello? but no one answered so i hung up. hmm...interesante. neway, then i got up at 9:30, had breakfast, showered and went to the shopping center with allison and kate. go us, we r health-ay! lol. some guy wolf-whistled at us when we were walking back but it sounded RELE strange like a machine or somtin so we're guessing he had some button he pressed....rele weird sound. well we got back, we hung out until they had to leave, washed my hair (i didnt have time to before) and went to allison's to watch grease. ok i must b like a deprived kid but i only saw that once in 5th grade. that movie is great though! and john's a cutie, esp his little twistie thing on his hair! im not being sarcastic i seriously think its like THE coolest thing...lol. and omg, he moves his hips WAY too much for a guy (kinda sexy tho) i seriously thot they were gonna like fly off.  i mean...well like i told kate: Me: i cant even move mine that much! Me: y shud he b able to? lol ok well im done with that.   o SNL tonite with avril performing! MUST watch it, unless im like asleep by then but i probly wont b. mmm i have some hw to do too, i dont think ill be going out tomorrow at least not the whole time so ill just leave it until sunday night as usual (im rele trying to change this but i dont think its possible..lol) mmm...well i think thats about it *THE END*I HATE brittany murphy.  she is way too cute, and she has made out with (and more) with two guys on my "three hottest" list: 1. ashton kutcher 2. eminem 3. hayden christenson no fair :( Just Married is sooo good!  "Budder Doody"=Slow pooping partially constipated buffalo of cinco de mayo! and the German people who poo on each other when they have sex!  DONT TRY THIS AT HOME BOYS AND GIRLS! wow good times in Drew's pimp car. wow i did NOT wanna get up this morning, way too early. school was boring but went by kinda fast, after skool that puppy was bugging me, at first he was playful but then he wud just wander away and lay down. i kept trying to get him to play but he wud wander away to lay down each time.  oo an interesting convos with anthony at lunch...about dirtay things. lol.  ooo an meggers was back in skool:), she was sick yest :(   i think thats all the news today.  i kinda told about my day backwards and stuff but o well, enjoy!  Goodbye and goodnightWhat do you call a Mexican guy with a rubber toe? Roberto!Gosh...I'm getting closer and closer to my younger cuz, the one who i said before i cant trust.  And I'm thinking about that the whole time but at the same time its nice to be close with her so i kind of ignore the voice in my head telling me to remember what she has done. I'm hoping shes not like that anymore...but I kinda hope that every time I c her and im proven wrong.  The only thing im doing right is only telling her what i want her to know. Sarah weren't you supposed to fly down and slap me or something if this happened? i think it was in an email or something but i think you promised me. can someone remind me how mad i was please?...........im so torn between just wanting to forgive and forget and move on...and wanting to hold a grudge and keep it between us forever so she cant do that again. advice neone???Today puppy decided to play "Let's Sniff Arleen" (i think he made it up) and i was sitting down so he was like running around me shoving his nose into me an sniffing, and he ran behind me an stuck his nose in my back, it tickled so much i jumped and squealed! hehe hes a QT!  i am very mad at megsh!t for leavaying us on her little trip to never never land. or as she calls it the retreat. wut a crap! a HUGE CRAP! :( :( :( mmm thats about it for now. oo and hot chick is a great movie. so is lilo and stitch.  but the greatest of all is 8 CRAZY NIGHTS!!! byez allI'm listening to the "Bum Biddy" song from 8 Crazy Nights...good stuff good stuff!

THX FOR BEING SO BLEEPING CONSIDERATE. and then i washed my hair (rele late by then cuz it took me a while to finish studying hmm wonder y) and my mom comes an yells at me to go to bed and then i was online for like 10min an my parents were liek WHAT ARE YOU DOING GO TO BED an i did an like a half hour later my bros still up an my parents r like dear its time for bed. i mean WTF the one who spends all day first earning money, then studying, then trying to not bleeping yell at them for being jerks (and succeeding) gets yelled at like shes a bad kid and the other one whos out all day, doesnt study, comes home way later than he said with no explanation an practically made them crap their pants gets a lecture, no punishment...an thats about it... wow life is awesome isnt it? and ok this morning i had to make my own sandwich, i wudnt even give a crap except my bros lunch was already made an packaged (and not by him obviously) i mean yes i think its wonderful my parents love him and treat him great, but why do i get the crappy end of the stick?

(lol, yeah, cuz u hit ppl in baseball..) but yeah it was funny or i thought it was anyway, lol well then i went home an went online for a little but then i took a nap, then my mom woke me up since i was on her bed and i just flopped down on my bed and fell asleep again, i woke up a few times but i pretty much slept until 5:45 when i woke up, and it did me a lot of good to sleep that much.  today i had an ok skool day, went to christian club (i wanna b an officer next year so i needa start going again, an i picked a good day too cuz they took care of that stuff, nominations an all, today) and then after skool i had lax, it was fun but we did wraparoud drills which i dont like bcuz theyre not realistic, things are way different in a game, and plus thats not how i play and i dont wanna injure ne of my own teammates, and i just get bored with it. sean taught me how to really launch the ball, which i need because if i get the ball i wanna get it as far up field as i can.  when we did wraparounds, i played mostly defense (since thats wut i play in games) and i got hit twice when ppl shot, once in the ankle (and now my shins, ankle and feet hurt and i have a little bruise) and once square in the chest.  the chest hurt more at the time but its totally gone now, but like right then i was like "o mother--" and i like walked off a couple steps cuz i had tears in my eyes but like a couple min later i was ok well, after that i came home and then i ended up talking to kate for a while, we started out being pretty bitchy but then she said she wanted to just have a serious convo so i agreed and we like talked it all out, except shes insisting that our being friends just wont work and i cant get her to change that, and i did say i would leave this up to her so i guess this is pretty much it. thats about all thats going on as of now...i shud go do hw soon since i cant fall asleep like last night until i get it done geeze it looks like its like...5 and its 7 g'nightz kids luv, arleenanyone seen "how to lose a guy in 10 days"? a quote from it keeps running thru my head... "drama, drama, drama" it really applies to my life right now...hey kids! its been a while huh... well heres a quick blog bcuz i needa study for chem...:( umm whats been going on in my life... well the reason for not blogging is im playing lacrosse so that takes up way too much time, but its way fun!  i play point which is like a sweeper in soccer so i get to be violent, i got a yellow card once which was funny...lol, usually i just get a lot of fouls tho skool is speeding up...its like teachers all of a sudden decide theyre going too slow and give us craploads of homework right around CAT 6 (SAT 9 with a different name) tests, finals, and all that great end of the year stuff who loves the heaven candlelight remix? i do, that is the absolute cutest song ever umm...friend drama...lets not get into that. u guys im sooo sick of drama, cant we all just b happy and be friends? gosh i said before i can handle other things as long as things with friends are going good, it just takes too much energy to fight over petty things, and i dont even have time to concentrate on that right now...my "group" is sposed to be like my break from stress but its just more stress sometimes...dont get me wrong i love you guys to death its just the drama crap that im sure we all agree sux umm what else...i went on a cruise over spring break, GOOD FOOD, and its there 24/7 like if u wake up at 5am and ur starving, you can be sure you will find some kind of snack somewhere, and it wont be a crappy little thing, it will be the best snack you have ever had. lol, i miss that, except sleeping and eating for a week straight isnt too healthy... i got cornrows in jamaica, which looks pretty cute but theyre kinda loose.. mmm wut else, i kissed a dolphin in jamaica too her name was betta an shes a total cutie, she was way goregeous an i petted her an it was great :) lol omg in key west this store had all these awesome bongs...LOL it was so funny mmm what else...ooo i missed my besterest friends!!!!

My parents refuse to do absolutely anything cool or even make an effort to do something I want to do, it's just like if they don't feel like it, then NO.  I'm sorry but you would think when you have a good kid (not to sound conceited bcuz its not that great but its good for parents) you trust them more and try to show your appreciation?  I mean, seriously, like so many people go and get drunk or high and I'm the one preaching to them about how bad and how dumb it is, but they have WAY more trust from their parents than me.  I'm also the one insisting on taking 3 AP classes when even my parents are telling me it's too much.  I know it sounds like I'm talking about how good I am, but there are downsides to it.  I can't go out and party because what's the point, everyone's just going to get drunk.  I'm gonna have like no life next year but I know it's an important year.  It's just so many people are horrible kids and their parents let them do anything, even after they catch them doing something.  It drives me insane, especially lately.  Also, this whole week ive been sleeping on this crappy futon in my brother's room because my grandma was sick and what she had was contagious (i forget the name of it) and she was sleeping in my room.  Yesterday I was doing HW in my room and my dad comes in and yells at me about how I have to change my sheets, I mean thanks for caring about me getting sick but yelling at me over it is kind of pointless and stupid, since I didn't do anything wrong anyway.  This morning I was wearing these shorts (ive worn them before, they're really cute) and he was like no way you're going to school in that, you know better than that, blah freaking blah... I mean, he was there when I bought them.  I hate when my parents buy me something and later on tell me I can't wear it to school. ("You can wear it to the beach"-my mom.) Um, thats wonderful and all except I go to the beach about 5 times a year, if even that much.  I really don't need 5 pairs of shorts (3" inseam! thats like as long as they get unless I buy guy shorts!) for the freaking beach!  GOD my parents drive me insane.  Yeah, the thing with my birthday party is we can't get a hotel room for a sleepover unless my parents get one next door (because we're going to....what? get drunk off martinelli's like at new year's?) because we're "underage".  Most overage ppl would do a lot more than I was planning on doing..(especially since I wasn't planning anything).  Sorry I'm sure I'm boring most people but I am just SO sick of this, WHAT can I do to get some trust?  It's not like I can stop doing something bad or start doing something good because I'm already there, and I'm sure when I'm 35 my parents will let me have my own hotel room without them next door but IT WONT MATTER THEN.  ERRRGHH, it's like ever since i was little my I've been "too young" for stuff, and I guess that was understandable, except now i'm not too young for stuff and my parents still think i am.  well im pretty much done here but yeah i thot i wud let everyone know that being good dzunt pay off *Arleen*its been a few days since ive written so heres whats going on since then... "no more drama in my life"-mary j. blige (i think?)  but yeah, at least for now things are good friday night we went to islands and omg, it was like random skool sports teams day or somtin cuz like saints baseballers were there and westview (or wutever that one high skool is) gymnastics team was there an sheesh. also, a bunch of ppl from our skool were there. it was a ton of fun tho, we played "im going on a picnic" hahaha it was probly the most perverted game of that ever played.  we brought an Arleen a Baseball bat a Coke a Dildo an Elephant a F*cker a Go-go dancer a Homosexual an Itsy bitsy teenie weenie yellow polka dot bikini (from the song in case u didnt get that) a J(dont remember) a Kinky butter knife Lingerine a Moob a Nasty condom an Orgasm a Penis a Q-tip a Raunchy somtin (dont remember) a S (dont remember) a T (dont remember) a Uvula a Vibrator a Wigga a Xylophone a Y (dont remember) a Z (dont remember)  lol, yeah we had some fun. kate and allison, if u remember any of the ones i didnt post, pls tell me wut they r (me an meg dont know) after islands we came back to my house and hung out for a while, watched punk'd (ASHTON KUTCHER! lol) but yea that show is really funny and then we watched Jackass which is kinda lame but it was a funny episode, it was the one with the yoga and how he keeps farting...lol Saturday morning i had a lacrosse game and Meg and Chels came to watch, it went pretty well we palyed Poway who is about the same level as us so it was a good game, we tied 7-7. i played point the whole time (no offense for once, thank God-my coach puts me in offense the second half and i do my best but i feel rele like...out of place, and im always like wishing i was playing point) one of the girls kept fouling ppl and got a yellow card in the first like 5min, but she did a really good job, it was just funny cuz shes so aggressive.  i got really pissed near the end of the game, but when i was about to seriously charge someone i got pulled out cuz it was 10:30 and i had to go drive up to san bernardino for my bro's soccer game (i left like 15min b4 the game ended). but yeah thats enuf lax cuz im sure it interests me a lot more than u guys, lol  saturday night we watched corky romano and part of i know what you did last summer at my house, then we took everyone home and i went to sleep cuz i was tired.  today im sposed to do something with alyssa but im waiting for her to call, so yeah. thats about all for now. later ppls *Arleen*Hey guys, its been a while since i blogged eh... well, like a week, lol hmmm well recently, not a ton has been going on.  this weekends been...well stuffs going on, nothing big but yeah.  friday i got the cutes ducky from my secret pal and i was talking to my bro who goes wtfff... an took it from me, an the duck is holding a water bottle, an one of my bros friend tries to grab it an goes "WATER!" in a high voice, so i reach to take the duck away from my bro (which is by his crotch but i havent noticed, hahaha) and at the same time i go "ooo sexy" (about the "WATER" thing) an so his friends laughed at me cuz that was...wrong..lol and then another one squirted his water on my ankle...it was cold haha.  yeah my bros friends r some funny kids.  after skool i had my game (we got starbucks yummm) we lost 7-3 but i injured ppl, LOL.  i tripped one girl, and got called for it.  then i hit a girl in the chin when we were both going for the ball... and the last one was the best, this girl had the ball and i stick-checked her and hit her hands and arms as i did, and she was like "ow!" an she got the ball a few more times so i kept doing that, an she was like "ow! ow! ow!" LOL i felt bad at the time but its rele funny looking back on it...and yeah, the end. after that me meg and allison had a movie night, only we didnt watch movies. hahaha.  then today me, meg and kate went to the shoppaying center for lunch and we were gonna go to the billy graham thing at qualcomm with bob (jessica) and sam, but meg and kate cudnt go :'( so it was just us 3, but its ok cuz theyre cool chicks.  the concert was soo cool, salvador went 1st an i dun rele know em but they were cool, they sang in spanish too! :-D then DC TALK!!!! and they sang JESUS FREAK which is the best song and then tobymac came on and sang extreme days, an DC talk came back and sang in the light (i was hoping for all 3) an kirk franklin was last and he was amazing too. then billy graham talked for a little and called ppl to accept Christ and it was amazing, all the ppl who did went down on the field, and when they were all down there, there were more ppl on the field than in the stands, it was soo cool.  then we went to dinner at PONCE'S! how cool is that, my own last name!!! lol well then i came home an did all this stuff SNL in 18 min...foney with meg and maybe dustin too good night all, an happy mothers day! *Arleen*The lacrosse game yesterday was super awesome, we played JV and lost (which is kind of a relief considering theyre next years varsity) but it was close, 6-4, and for once i got kinda beat up but its ok im fine, and i gave out some nice bruises so its good.  my friends came to the game too and cheered for me "101 is #1!"-kate. lol.  then we went to pazzos for dinner and ended up sleeping at megs.  then this morning i had to go to this college fair at UCSD which was a total waste of time and getting up early bcuz i wudnt consider ne of the colleges there except UCSD, but i knew that before i even went.  then i wasted a whole afternoon doing nothing an then ppl came over an we watched the hot chick, which is super funny.  it was a good day. i still dunno wut to do for my birthday party, so if u have any super cool ideas let me know! lol *Arleen*Had a four-hour break from the office today. We had to get out because they were painting the 5th floor and all the fumes got in the vents. Like all other  Pinoys , we went to the mall. hahahahaha!  Thought about watching  Mano Po  and struggle with Kris Aquino's one facial expression. (No matter how much she screws up her face, there's just one expression there). But thought better of it and saw  Dekada '70 . That was screwy - I began to hate the Marcoses all over again.......  The image that keeps replaying itself over and over again in my head is Jhong Hilario's torture scene.....I want my mommy.....This is it.   Finally got myself some space in this cyber-reality. Got myself a virtual-diary. Oh come on, don't be so dismissive. This is what these things are. If I know,  kayo din naghahanap ng lakas ng loob para gumawa ng ganito. Tama na yang kaartehan nyo . If you, like, think that I'm  seeeew  pathetic that I, like, have to broadcast my emotions to the  madla , do me a favor. Go offline. Find a book and make yourself more literate. The earth will thank you, and who knows? You could pass yourself off as something more than a half-wit.       Where was I? Oh yes, my virtual diary. I spend more than 10 hours online and I figure that this is much safer way of venting. Better a program than my boss. Less chance of getting fired. I need the money. Those shoes don't geow on trees, you know. They don't come cheap. Note to self: remember to write down forays into shoe retail....      I promise to   TRY   to not be too melodramatic.

He sent back something which basically said thet he didn't believe I felt that way. Ouch.   I don't much believe in happily-ever-after, especially for me. There is no such thing. And I never believed that there was one special person out there for me; neither did I put much trust in my relatives' belief that I would get marrried. Never. But with Jon, it was different. I would have walked the ends of the earth for this guy. I would have turned my back on everything that was home and gone with him. He only had to ask. That was the only thing he had to do. I would have sacrificed everything.  EVERYTHING   It's all over now. I haven't heard from him in weeks and now, my heart is broken. Where I never believed I was capable of suffering for someone else's happiness, now I do.   I loved fully, and honestly, and truthfully when I fell in love with Jonathan David Oldhouser. And he didn't love me back. Never again. I will never, never love again.  Shop's closed. Love don't live here anymore.Shop's closed.

I remember being alone for most of the February 14s in my lifetime, but I cannot remember being this sad. I cannot think of how I'll be on that day....  I've been with Jonathan for almost 3 years and while we've gone through spells of not talking to one another, it has never lasted this long. And I've always had e-mail....Why do guys do this?   He has told me he loves me. And I do know him well enough to know that he means it. Then how come I practically have to beg for his attention? I'm standing on the verge of just ringing him up to hear his voice. Am I so insignificant to him that he thinks nothing of ignoring me?Just got hold of a book by Randolf S. David (Prof. Randy David, to us inhabitanats of the P.I.). I forgot what is was called, but it was a collection of the articles he had written for the  Philippine Daily Inquirer . Everything was good. They were all cleverly written and I felt as if the good professor were reading the entries to me as I read them. For one who is extremely passionate about what he teaches and his convictions for the motherland, Prof. David is a very soft-spoken man. Very malumanay.....  I, on the other hand, belong to the school of thought that believes that passion is best expressed with noise. Plus, my statements are often punctuated with gesticulations that, if done by someone lighter, would cause that individual to take flight. As Jessica Zafra said: If you can't dazzle them with artistry, drown them with noise.......  You should all get a copy of Professor David's book....It's available at the Sociology Department of the University of the Philippines. 250 Pesos, I think....My Soulmate says that this guy - Gael Garcia Bernal - is the male species' equivalent of  Gardenia Bread .

thursdayschildtoo: nope. not interested anymore thursdayschildtoo: are you recovering ok? fairytales_320: for the most part. i fall back into my lapses, but i am trying to keep myself occupied and get things going w/my life. still it is hard cuz i was in love w/her (my 1st), so i still replay everything in my head fairytales_320: u? thursdayschildtoo: that's how it is with first times thursdayschildtoo: i really don't think i'll ever recover fairytales_320: wow, even after talking w/me!?! ;) thursdayschildtoo: you know what i mean fairytales_320: even though it is set up for that ever important "1st time" i think that if you allow yourself to feel again and take that risk that it will happen. i know that the "1st time" moment has really been built up, so try to releaze that that is not the "end all, be all", but u r an intelligent and awesome person, so life will totally work out for u thursdayschildtoo: nope. it took me this long to finally fall in love. i hate that i was taken for granted when i put in every effort. thursdayschildtoo: the fall out is too horrible.  thursdayschildtoo: and that's easy for you to say erik - you've never been ugly fairytales_320: i can definitely feel u on that, but realize that there r 5 1/2 billion people out there and along the way u run into jerks and people that don't appreciate who u r and what u do. it's a learning process and u have to keep going and learn from everything. it's ok to take the time to learn about someone and keep the guard up for that, but don't let yourself be so hurt or get so jaded that u never let yourself take that chance again thursdayschildtoo: how do you know who is or isn't the jerk? fairytales_320: ok, i've definitely felt ugly for many moments in my life and i know what u look like, so don't even say that u r ugly. i think that the little things in life count and someone that is able to recognize and sincerely appreciate those things is someone that isn't a jerk. i think that in that instance it is clear to see if one is being fake about that  thursdayschildtoo: not really....sometimes the level of like/lust is too high to judge clearly fairytales_320: i see that point, but i think that through time and events that u go through, it becomes more apparent (even with those "goggles" on) and u see the true content of character and personality cuz evn the best of con artists can't maintain "fakeness: through-out the course of time thursdayschildtoo: i hope so...for your sake at least fairytales_320: yours too, u better not shut down that great heart of yours thursdayschildtoo: you deserve perfection fairytales_320: before i can be worthy of derserving anything, i need to be able to be satisfied with me and who i am thursdayschildtoo: good point thursdayschildtoo: although self worth is indirectly determined by other's perception of you fairytales_320: indirectly...but a significant other should be the compliment of an already complete person thursdayschildtoo: good point. although useless info to me fairytales_320: so, that fundamental sense of self worth should already be in place fairytales_320: give yourself more credit pia...u r a cute girl with great intelligence, personality and an awesome heart thursdayschildtoo: yup...that's me: the cute girl full of personality fairytales_320: don't give me that sarcastic shit!!! thursdayschildtoo: and don't yell at me! fairytales_320: do u know how much props u need ot give yourself for being able to communicate so clearly with me while living in a foreign country that speaks such a foreign language fairytales_320: i wasn't yelling..just emphasizing fairytales_320: that is a hard thing to do thursdayschildtoo: it comes from watching years of sesame street. fairytales_320: ha  :p fairytales_320: what r u thinking?

This was in the  urlLink Manila Standard  yesterday:    Libra:  You long to renew a relationship but view responsibilities with caution.  This state of affairs tends to sabotage your love life.  Give romance another chance. Aquarius plays a part.   Bullshit.  I'm at work, blogging when I should be working (again). I'm not really sure if I even qualify as someone who has a horoscope since I was born on the cusp. But I laways read mine because it never matches the crap that's going on in my life anyway, but that one yesterday just made me suck in my breath. I wonder if he even thinks of me because that's all I do at night - think of him. I've given up hoping.  Basta , all I know is that there is no space left for me in his life. And that is what will kill me....  Ended up texting all night with my BFF, Roxanne (WTF, I'm twenty-freakin'-five and I still use that acronym) because her mom is Satan's successor.  I hate her her mom . Roxy's freakin' amazing and she doesn't deserve that harpy. I hope Roxy gets to be dirty, rotten, filthy, stinkin' rich and her mom swallows her tongue.   I hate feeling envious by the way. I hate the feeling inspred by that most famous of all muses - the green-eyed monster.   I dreamt about Tricia's hunny. We were sitting next to each other and we were talking. I was speaking in  taglish , but I think he understood me. He showed me his wallet and I opened it and saw that it was full of photos of fans - in my dream I found it strange that it was full of photos of people from my high school. But when  woke up, all I remembered was that the wallet he handed me was pink. I woke up and the first thing I yelled was  "GET HIM OUT OF MY SUBCONSCIOUS!!!!" .

From her  March 24  entry:  I keep dreaming of you and things are the way they are now: I'm engaged to someone else, you've been out of touch for so long. We see each other - I think I've flown all the way there to see you only I cannot remember getting on/off a plane but there we are, and I pretend that it's all good, that I still don't get that sharp pain sometimes when I think of us, and you're being good, not just good, great: charming, sweet - all the things I loved you for. And I ask you those questions I've been wanting to for, ooh, 3 years now and you tell me truthfully that you were scared. We laugh and are so easy together. Your hair is longer and darker, curly even, you let the streaks of blonde grow out. I run my fingers through it playfully and it feels just the way it used to, thick and silky. You take my hand in yours and see my ring and then it hits me: we can't just run away and pretend it was all a bad dream. I have someone else now, someone not afraid to love me and make sacrifices for me. I tell you how good he is to me and you smile sadly, you know you missed your chance. I tell you you could have called me, could have let me know you were still mine all this time, but you tell me I should have known .     It hurts less now to think of you, less than last year, or the one before . Less than that last night we spent together where I felt I was tearing in two. Where we sat in our apartment and smoked and watched the snow outside swirl around the streetlight. I wished time would stand still, swore I would not sleep, but in the end I was exhausted from crying all week, and there was to be no last-minute reprieve. You held it together so well - you'd only ever cried that once, three months earlier, when I was trying to decide whether to go home then or stay for New Year's, the millennium and I asked you what you wanted and you said me. We slept badly that last night, I kept waking up to see the time. Finally we awoke at 5 and you were doing a great job of keeping me preoccupied until you found the card I had made for you and you collapsed on our bed, sobbing, clutching my t-shirt. We drove to the airport in swirling snow and I hoped for a moment that my plane would be grounded, but then it was only prolonging the pain. You watched me smoke my last cigarette outside the airport and snowflakes landed on my lashes and froze with my tears. You said we'd be together again but somewhere deep down I knew it was over...tricia042: whachup? thursdayschildtoo: wala....  there was a pause  thursdayschildtoo: sorry ha..nagchichismisan kami dito e tricia042: whoops sorry  thursdayschildtoo: what's the unknown bang?

The 11th Commandment that never made the Old Testament...  11. Thou shalt not not love The Pettit Project!!    Head over to Pettit's website!!! http://thepettitproject.com  bless!prounced: "pett-it"   Alright, I know it's been awhile, but meh. July 6th, I went to a Fefe Dobson concert. If you don't know who Miss Dobson is, then you are a bigger loser than me... http://www.fefedobson.com. Btw, Fefe is not her *real* name, but a pet name coming from the proper "Felicity". Anyhow, I would not have gone to that concert if it wasn't for Julie K. who is my next door neighbour. She's a really nice person. Her eldest son, Dan, is Fefe's lead guitarist.   So we went downtown to Capital Music Hall. It was a tiny little place, well tiny compared to like the NAC lol. It was about the size of a gymnasium.   Okay so I was there, standing for like 10 minutes when the opening band (The Pettit Project) started. The lead singer dude, Scott Komer, is like 6'5", blonde and really, really queery. There's nothing wrong with queery people though. They played like all of their songs, about 8, I think. When they were done, I was happy that the night was almost through -- you see, I didn't particularly LOVE them (at that time), I was more worried if I was ever going to hear again. The loudness of the music was well... extreme.  Next, Fefe came on and did all her schblewy -- that's a brand new word I just came up with -- w00t!! She was pretty awsome. She had one song, which she said was new, "Don't Go, Boys and Girls". It seemed to be about "boys should be with boys, girls should be with girls, and boys should be with girls", I think. I never really understood that one. I mean what does the title have to do with such a topic? ¿Don't Go?  Afterwards, my mind sort of drifted -- like it does often -- and I started thinking about Pettit. I really wanted to get a CD. So I did. I made Scotty sign it. Yay! Anyway, they are all I can listen to now. I think I know all the words to the songs on that CD, as well as Mr. Obvious on http://purevolume.com/thepettitproject/music. These people absolutely rock my world.  What is so amazing about Pettit, is that I was never really in love with rock music. Now I am. I have pretty much begun ditching rap, except d12 and eminem!! I haven't listened to much country or celtic or welsh or french or anything but Pettit, since I discovered them.  So we can now say that July 6th, 2004ce was a life changing day for moi. Très bien.  bless ye!I don't like the fact that whenever I open up my access log, I get overwhelmed by the junk requests that waste my valueable bandwidth and harddrive spaces. They all tend to attempt to execute some code, which does not exist on my Linux box, and compromise my server. Apache is not vulnerable to those IIS-specific exploits, but they are annoying to hell nonetheless.  A few google searches reveals that you can put a few lines in the config file that matches the requests to a regexp and redirect them to elsewhere if they are found to be malicious. They do work like a charm, well,  but for only subset of the exploits. The nastiest "SEARCH  /\x90\x02\xb1\x02\xb1\x02\xb1\x02\xb1\x02..." that easily takes hundreds of lines of my valueable log file space is still there. I'd really appreciate if some one could suggest an easy solution to get rid of this mess.urlLink Irssi Users List Archives (05/2003) - : DCC, ip_conntrack_irc.c and file names   I always thought that it was a bug in irssi that prevented me from dcc-sending files with spaced filenames--until one day, I noticed a few lines in dmesg:   Forged DCC command from x.x.x.x: 0.0.0.0:0 Forged DCC command from x.x.x.x: 0.0.0.0:0 Forged DCC command from x.x.x.x: 0.0.0.0:0   After some googling I found that the conntrack module chokes on spaced filenames... So far, my only workaroound is to rename the files so that spaces are replaced with underscore using the following one-liner:   for file in *; do mv "$file" `echo "$file" | tr ' ' '_'`; doneja:    血  ち  見  み てぇのか？   en: Wanna see blood? zh:  想見血嗎？   Pronunciation: chi-mee-T'HE-no-ka  The usage of this phrase is self-explanatory, but whose blood it means is entirely up to the person the phrase is addressed to.

In the example, B presents an anecdote which does not invalidate A's statement in anyway.

I have been comteplating on what to write, since this is my first post. Gotta take it seriously, you know. But then I realized that I shouldn't try so hard squeezing my ideas out of my brain just to fulfill some first post length requirement I made up on my own. That's just plain silly...C folks all love the null-terminated strings. They can do all sort of wonderful tricks to them such as inserting nulls at arbitrary positions to cut or deliminate the the strings. However, it is not the case in Java or .NET strings, where they are heavily protected and limited by their length field.  If you are using Winforms on Windows, you will notice that the assemblies are simply the wrappers of the good old WIN32 API. If you try to make a text field display a string with Unicode 0x0000 in it, when it gets to the marshalling everything after the null character will get truncated.  It's some interesting observation, but I have yet to find a use for this trick.mood: sleepy listening to: stacie orrico   hey peeps. jia , i think mardi is monday in laTiN. u think so? mayb its greek but it sounds latiny.how abt a band called rectangular ladiees? haha.. rightt. who's gg sharons house on the 3rdmood: lala listening to:   no jia.im not wisely studyin. and liz, i cant sing.. haha.. i wanna play the piano. excpt my piano playing sux. so in that case, i shall be ur manager.. haha.. jkin =pmood:happy listening to:myself playing my darling guitar(which is not the best thing to hear)  booya. ok jia. got it. actually i don't have much to write. except that i need 4 more gym badges. oh wait, i think i'm seriously addicted to gameboy pokemon... haha.mood: neutral (or trying to be) listening to: where is da loovvee - black eyed peas and justin timberlake  heeeyyyy people!!! the holidays are heeerrrreeeee!!! spend your time wisely studyin'!!!!!

Oh yar. and in case some of you blur-er people haven't realised, the background of this is green polka dots! waha. but I'll probably change it soon or when I have the time lah. Yuppers. Toodles!mood: stoning listening to: There is None Like You  Okay actually Michelle was supposed to do the first part, but since she hasn't, I'll do the first part and you do the second part okay michelle?? I can't hold it in any longer. _____________________________________________________________________  The date is the twenty-sixth of June. The day is Saturday. The time is 6.00 PM. He sits in the MRT that has just reached Changi Airport MRT Station. The doors have long since opened, leaving the way for him unobstructed. The only obstacle in his way now is making the decision.  He has made it thus far, out of his house and down the entire MRT line to get to the airport. And now, it is so difficult just to take the few steps out of the train. His mind is in turmoil. He is struggling with his feelings. What should he do? Sitting right across from the open doors, he toys with his handphone. He knows all the details: Terminal 1, Gate 16, Flight QF 6. All he needs is the willpower to get there. It's so easy. He just has to stand up and march out of this train which is going to close its doors at any minute.  Why did he ever come? It was so stupid. He didn't care anymore. She'd never notice if he was there or not. All he would accomplish would be making a fool of himself. But he'd admitted to himself, he was still madly in love with her. He couldn't let her go just like that. She was still very much a part of him.  Just remembering how much she meant to him gave him renewed courage and boldness. Adrenaline flooded his body as he stood up and made a dash through the adjoining carriages and out the door.  I'm coming,  he thought to her,  wait for me.  ___________________________________________________________________  For part two, BUG MICHELLE TAN FOR IT!!! The true story will be revealed after part two. Stay tuned!mood: madly in love!! *swoon* listening to: my bro jamming on his electric guitar  ooh i love lampard i love lampard i love lampard!!!!!mood: shocked listening to: err.. the windchime tinkling  can u believe it?

But then England also has good players.. so mayb after second thought, England is better? ahh.. but who cares.. haha.. Anyway, how are your holidays coming along.. I am starting to panic!lolmood:perfect 10 listening to:stewed beef haha.. i just a great inspiration to write an article abt the most happening stuff going on.. guess.. oh anw.. its the hunk array.. EURO2004!!!!  here goes: crazy abt euro2004 but the irony of me having the inability to catch any of the soccer mania. How frustrating!!! oh ofcourse i have to admit part of the desire of watching it is to fulfill every girl's satisfaction.  the HUNK APPETITE! hahaha... i mean, face it. a girl will always be a girl at heart. you see a suave-looking guy, u get a bit a tipsy. isn't true?? uless you're abnormal swooning over the wrong gender. oh don't u fid euro200 a reality show for choosing the most all rounded perfect model guy for choices of husband. awesome looks! deeeeep pockets for you enjoy the exqusite treasures and pleasures of the world (pls be reminded these articles are to taken lightly. Christian value: store our treasures in heaven not earth hor...) and lastly a stable income. if you're jobless, no fear. you have a huge bank acct behind you. and with your hubby's excellent soccer skills (i.e ronaldino), you don't have to further frown over your boy's future.  Just ask him to hone the skills from his father and wa-la u've produced a line a of superb soccer players. this applies for any marriage between you and a famous sport personnel hor... but euro2004 isn't only abt the hotties. it is also abt enjoying the thilling action and the intense anticipation of the heart-pounding football matches.  Once a striker is on fire, you start to slowly lift your butt of the couch and cheer and chant"goal goal goal" but usually 85% of the time its a false alarm.  Then let's say that Owen scores for England, the crowd automatically makes a joyful din. you'll hear things like" YES!" "GOAL Ah!! or the most annoying " YAY!! Money Come..." hahahaha.. don't you quite agree with me? especially the ah jeks, always say " ai seh! sui sui sia!" "hao qiu! da de hao! lai he jiu he jiu!" i have then termed euro2004 a hypertension-giver, heart-atacker-starter and a world of fantasies.  euro2004 makes people go boloney!! However i have to strongly reccomend euro2004. if u're looking for some good clean action-packed enjoyment, switch on the tv late at night tune to channel 5 and pumpthe adreline.  and a word of unholy advice, place your bets on any england germany and france and germany matches, they play well.  soak into the fever of euro2004 dears!!!  editor, cowwie
